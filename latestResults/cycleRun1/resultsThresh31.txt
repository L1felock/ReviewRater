I used these guys 3 times so far...the first time I used them it was a hot summer day in August and I remember the owner had a sprained arm wrapped up in a sling. He was out there assisting his team moving furniture with one arm.  Creative moving defiantly exceeded my expectations.

Ew, this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the "pool suite"-but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old, dirty, broken... And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again.

The whole place feels old, dirty, cheap and trashy. I think you get the point. AVOID!

Still one of my fave deals in Vegas. Especially with the new Rush Tower. It's like a fancy schmancy Strip room that would be $300 per night, but here it's only $80/night, plus you get an awesome view of all of the city, and there are $5 Blackjack tables.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

I was in an accident a few months back and USAA referred me to Gerber Collision, they had my car in and out, and painted perfectly. They replaced the rear bumper and passenger fender. The job was great and they patched my tire up for free! They were very nice and professional. They even gave me a ride to Enterprise Car Rental just as an added bonus. I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.

LOBSTER ICECREAM!!!

is the reason i bookmarked this place. i was excited cuz i was staying at planet hollywood. as i did research, reviews were lukewarm. I tried the lobster icecream and it was ok. I'd rather spend my $ at Earls. if ur a lobster freak, it's worth a looksie as they have many items like lobster grilled cheese, with waffles, lobster rolls- which are $22 for the large ones.

vibe of this place is food court

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

Solid carne asada. Not quite as good as the one on 7th Street. I think once the grill at this location gets more use and becomes seasoned, it will improve considerably. 
On the plus side, the soda machine is incredible!

Oh snaaap. If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge. While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.

The restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat.

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

When my mom picked him up he was covered in paint and what looked to be chemical burns. Along with a 106 degree fever. They didn't contact our family or the vet and refused to help with any bills despite the fact this was because of their negligence. I want as many people to know as possible that this place is a terrible place for your pets.

I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and a large soda for $7.77. They have that soda dispenser that can deliver just about any soda known to man. They were out of the Diet Dr. Pepper so I was saying no bueno until I saw that they had Diet Barq's Rootbeer. Nice save!

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

I took my 2002 Saturn into this shop based on the good reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed.  Bogi is terrific!  I picked her shop because it isn't too far from where I work and they took me to work and picked me up when my car was done. I was tired of going into shops where they tell you need other work done. Bogi explained everything to me. What sold me was I met a man there taking his car in (told me he had a newer car under warranty) and he told me he felt better taking his car into Bogi's place rather than the dealer! She is terrific! Will definitely take my car back to her.

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806. Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.

In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken. It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food. Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes. In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning. There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.

Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place.

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

Hands Down The Most Enjoyable Cirque Experience EVER!!!

If you're a fan of MJ and all his amazing work, this show is a Must See!

From the very start of the show to the very end, the performers had the audience engaged with hands clapping and toes tappin' 
Honestly, even if you have two left feet, you will feel compelled to get up and dance! 
The vibe of the entire show is lighthearted yet thoughtful to MJ's extensive body of work. It embodied the best of MJ and his dedication to music, children and equality.  

I truly enjoyed this show on so many levels and I'm not even a huge MJ fan.

Now, be warned, if you're a Cirque Du Soleil purist looking for the obligatory acrobats this show may not be for you. However, if you love a high energy, creative and unique experience, "One" will not disappoint! 

I guarantee you will leave the show feeling gooooood!

Happy Times!

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

I recently ventured into Filiberto's for the first time a few months ago. My wife was buying breakfast for her office (going green and car pooling), apparently her office staff loves this stuff. So I said I might as well try a burrito myself. My only problem was that I heard these burritos were only good if you're shitfaced or pretty close to it. 

I ordered the sausage burrito. I opened it up and saw all the gooey greasiness of it and ate most of the sausage and egg in the burrito, but not the tortilla. It was okay to stem my hunger pangs but definitely not my go to breakfast spot. My only regret was that I wasn't there at two O'Clock in the morning listening to the stumbling drunken orders at the drive up.

Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

Welcome to Chuck E Cheese from Hell!  

Not only would this attraction be suitable for family fun, but it'd also be great if you were looking to do a modern version of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".  I witnessed a couple of tourists in midst of that and I gotta admit...I was jealous.  They bathed in the KISStory and rocked out harder than anyone else when the band's late 80's hit "Forever" blared out the speakers.  I doubt they ever made it to playing golf.

This is unquestionably the best mini-golf course in Las Vegas.  The black lights, awesome tunes, incredible memorabilia (Eric Carr's Porsche right up front!) and KISS animatronics really transported me somewhere else.  The enormous models of Paul Stanley's Ibanez Iceman, Ace Frehley's triple humbucker Gibson Les Paul and then Gene Simmons' tongue on the 18th hole were insane.

My only gripe was that holding a scorecard, pencil, putter, golf ball and beer from hole to hole became as annoying as listening to a Peter Criss interview.  At least the beers were cheap.  It was $2 for the first round, $3 for the second etc.  That definitely eased my pain of being the worst mini-golfer in the world.    

Here's a $3 off per person coupon:
http://vegas4locals.com/couponkissminigolf.html
That makes it $8.95 for out of towners and $6.95 for locals.  SONIC BOOOOOM!!!

With island inspired drinks filled with various rums and juices... bring your sweet tooth! They even sell collection glassware for $20 and it comes with one of their signature drinks. Ive bought all of them haha. Vegas's best Mai Tai by far and amazing decor what more could you ask for! Oh yea and on Fridays from 4-8 if your wearing a Hawaiian shirt your drinks are half priced! The only bad thing about Frankies is there aren't more locations in town.

The people complaining about the way Chars looks have no idea what a Juke Joint (or a Honky Tonk if that's your flavor.  Dive Bar if you can relate to that) is supposed to look like.  The lights are supposed to be dim.... the place is supposed to be small... The place will have a band that doesn't care if their makeup is on correctly.... the place should make you question if the walls might fall down if the music gets any louder and the dance floor should be small as JUKE JOINTS are usually kinda small!!!!!  Somebody please educate these folks on JUKE JOINTS.... Meanwhile, let me tell you about Chars.

If you're looking for absolutely NO pretentiousness, NO frills, Tables that don't cost $600, or basically the opposite of clubbing in Scottsdale .... Chars is your spot.  If you are interested in Rhythm and Blues and Soul covers and a rocking good time.... Chars is your spot.  If you are looking for a live music venue where people dance AND mingle with each other and actually speak and talk to you just because... Chars is your spot.  If you have stumbled upon my review because you are looking for a decent time.... Chars is your spot.  

 I absolutely LOVE Chars for everything that it is AND for everything that it is NOT.

The service and selection at Churchill's is as good as it gets! 

A friend of mine bought me a humidor from here as a gift. There was a continual problem with the small humidifier that attaches to the inside of the lid. 

After many attempts at fixing the issue, they made the decision to upgrade me to the next size, almost twice as big as well as upgrading the humidification system inside the box. 

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with a hello and if I need anything they're right there to take care of me. 

I drive out of my way to go here and this is the only place in town that I'll buy my cigars from.

HEALTH IS HAPPINESS

  The Peccole Ranch Walking Trail (PRWT) is an unsigned Summerlin trail system in the neighborhood bounded by Hualapai Way to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, Fort Apache Avenue to the east, and Sahara Avenue to the south. After experiencing PRWT, I see it as three connected concrete trails winding through a continuous linear park. Trail 1 starts at Hualapai Way to the west which is 0.4 miles north of Sahara Avenue. A tunnel carries it under Grand Canyon Drive. After intersecting with a spur trail, it heads northeast. A second tunnel carries it under Red Hills Drive. Leaving the tunnel it parallels Apple Drive up to it concludes at Trail 2 near Charleston Boulevard. This is the physical fitness trail. Fitness stations with cooresponding descriptive signs adorn the parkscape. They include a vertical ladder, chinning bars, and squat-stretch bench. If health is happiness, this is the trail to happiness. Trail 2 runs south of the commercial and residential development along Charleston Boulevard from Hualapai Way to a couple hundred feet east of the Apple Drive tunnel. Trail 2 weaves through a linear disk golf course. Trail 3 is the spur trail off Trail 1, which continues the due-east direction of PRWT past a surface crossing with Preakness Pass to the easternmost point at Fort Apache Road.

  In late November, I spent a couple of hours enjoying an adventure on PRWT. It reminded me of its sister linear parks in Summerlin: The Pueblo Park and Cottonwood Canyon. However, there were a few characteristics that separated PRWT from its sister linear parks. In comparison, it is a more compressed space bordered by walls instead of larger homes up on hills; with the exception of the trail east of Preakness Pass,  the landscape is golf course green grass; and parking lots are nonexistent. 

  My adventures along PRWT color me impressed. Graffiti is nonexistent. Mature pine trees and colorful trees that left sprinklets of fallen leaves on golf course green grass attracted birds. Birds were everywhere. Many of the adjacent backyards have humingbird feeders. The white concrete trail is a work of art that gently weaved between the bordering walls of the linear park and under picturesque tunnels. Green streetlamps complimented the parkscape. The gentle inclines added texture to the trail. And the fitness stations are a celebration of good health.

  This is an unadvertised trail. Signing and parking lots are nonexistent. My advice is to park at either the Sahara West Library parking lot or Hualapai Commons Shopping Center anchored by Smith's at the southeast corner of Charleston and Hualapai. To reach PRWT from the Sahara West Library, you will walk north on Grand Canyon Drive for 0.4 miles until you reach the overpass. The Hualapai Commons is adjacent to PRWT. Both parking lots are a relatively short distance east of the 215.

  After spending a couple of hours exploring PRWT I felt uplifted and a few pounds lighter than when I came into the trail. I felt healthy! As the sign says on the fitness trail "health is happiness. " And because this is the season of giving, I want to give people happiness by recommending an adventure on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

For my birthday weekend, I simply could not refuse an all inclusive triple threat package offered by the esteemed Wynn resort, which included complimentary tickets to Le Reve, room upgrades at the hipper and edgier Encore suites, VIP access to XS and free buffet! I know, It was pretty much a no-brainer in my book.  

Upon arrival at the Encore, parking was a breeze! Complimentary valet had me out of my car and in the registration line in a snap! Speaking of registration, I was convinced to "upgrade" my existing upgrade to a 60th floor panoramic suite. I know, I'm weak, but i'm glad I gave in! The upgraded room was magnificent! It came with an expansive living space with two plush queen beds, large bath with shower and separate soaking tub and outstanding views of the Las Vegas strip!  And who can forget about the remote controlled curtains and bathroom TV ;)  Tack on top of that premium gaming options, the exquisite resort grounds, and exceptional dining options, which include sumptuous tapas at La Cave and spectacular brunch fare at Tableau, and you've got yourself one happy birthday boy!   VIP access to the hottest clubs on the strip like XS and Surrender and premium shopping at premier boutiques like Herms, Chopard & Louis Vuitton doesn't hurt either.  If golfing is your thing, Steve Wynn's got the largest 18 hole golf course on the Strip!  

Honestly, I practically spent my entire weekend here and rarely felt the need to ever leave the grounds. Now that's not an easy feat for any resort given all the tempting hotel and entertainment options out there!  

Happy Times!

Are you kidding me?  Seriously.

If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.

We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.

Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.

This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  

And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.

We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  

Seriously.

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 37/100

The bf and I paid a visit to the Conservatory & Botanical Garden at Bellagio this past weekend :) It was all decked out for Chinese New Year, with festive decorations everywhere, incense burning, a tree made out of gold coins, and a giant mountain with practically full-sized horses in honor of the Year of the Horse. It was wonderful!

I hear they re-decorate it to match whatever season/holiday is going on at the moment. I would love to see each of the rotations in a calendar year!

The Conservatory is located just past the lobby in the Bellagio hotel - very easy and quick to get to. It has wonderful natural lighting coming in through glass panes in the ceiling, and has beautiful flowers and plants planted everywhere. Great photo op spot as well!

It actually wasn't as big as I remembered it to be when I came here as a child...but nonetheless, definitely something worth seeing during your visit to Bellagio!

There is a garden gift shop nearby where they sell nice souvenirs and trinkets :) There's also a store that sells the beautiful glass flowers hanging from the ceiling in the lobby of the hotel, but I'm sure they cost an arm and a leg just for one!

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked to see how my pets were doing. I can't say enough about Amanda's Pet Sitting! Amanda followed my instructions perfectly and was always in touch with me and returned my phone calls right away. I've used her services for years now and I'm always happy with her service. I recommend Amanda to everyone I know that has pets.

Forget about those other foot massage places that "waste" your 1 hour treatment time by soaking your feet for half an hour. This no frills, straight to business foot massage business is the real deal!  No "happy endings" here, unless it refers to satisfied customers with their full body therapeutic massages.

I actually dropped in on a whim, as I was feeling very uncomfortable with severe neck and shoulder cramps. I did the quick Yelp search to see which massage places are still opened and picked one of the closest ones.  I parked at the massage place next door by accident, but am very glad I walked the last few feet to Good Season's Foot Spa () for their "ancient professional reflexology".

My therapist was Tom, and I learned that he has been doing this in California for 12 years. He was definitely an old pro at helping customers feel better with his expert hands.  If all you are expecting is a good foot massage, Tom will probably be overkill. If you walked in with sore shoulders and back, Tom is the one you should seek out.

I am so satisfied with my first experience that I made an appointment to go back in 12 hours.  Now if that is not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what else would qualified.

Note: $15/hour grand opening special applies before midnight, after that it is $20/hour. Visa and MasterCard accepted, but American Express is not recognized ($1 per swipe surcharge).

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

The Chandelier is a multi-story love bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's a memorable setting with memorable drinks and plenty of unique couches, seats, and tables. It's easy to find a spot just right for you and your friends.

Plus one star for having several flavors of Hangar One Vodka available!

Another bonus star for super friendly, but efficient servers. No complaints at all.

My wife rated the Cosmopolitan hotel's house Cosmopolitan ($15) her favorite drink in Vegas. If she's happy, then I'm happy. 

I was looking for something different and tried a cocktail called Bruce Tea ($14) with Kai Coconut Pandanus Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Lemongrass-infused Coconut Cream, Birdseye Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves, and sprinkled with Matcha Tea Powder. It was too different. I switched to Hangar One Mandarin and Tonic ($14) for the rest of the evening.

If you are staying or visiting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it will be hard to miss the giant crystal strands of the Chandelier. It may not be a destination bar, but it is the best bar at the Cosmopolitan. Don't miss the opportunity to relax for a few rounds of drinks.

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.

The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you.

"Thank you for calling Cox Communications. My name is Melika. How may I assist you today?"
"Hello Melika. I'd like pay the minimum on our cable bill please."
"OK sir. I would be happy to assist you with this today. May I please have your PIN."
"I have no idea what our PIN is. I"m sorry. What other information may I give you."
"The social security number for the primary customer."
"Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..."
"Yes sir, well I do understand that you have that information, I will not be able to assist you."
"OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money."
"Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment."
"Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us."
"Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day."
Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

DATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. 

Now that's a pretty picture for ya!

House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. 

Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!

Is a trip to Vegas ever complete without a visit to a Cirque du Soleil show?  I think not.

Whats a trip to Vegas without seeing some naked girls swimming and writhing in a giant human-sized fish bowl filled with water?

                                '---------'

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

"Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound?
That only echoes through the night."

The French Canadian with pipes like an angel, the gifted Celine Dion.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#Kbvx9GtNiElinZ0HzpQ_Lw

Celine looked absolutely stunning, captivating the Friday night audience with her melodic voice & touching lyrics.  I felt quite a few goosebumps as she sang hits such as-

"But when you touch me like this,
and when you hold me like that.
I just have to admit,
that it's all coming back to me."

Our seats located in the rear orchestra had a great view of the stage, off center left.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#w6Yz3Dx-Wgzi0dRHERURxQ

Celine did several covers of other artists' songs, but I would've preferred if she sang more of her music library.  She even performed 2 hologram duets, one of which was interestingly enough, with herself.  Can't say I didn't get the most Celine Dion for the dollar ;p

"Cause I am your lady,
and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can."

Of course, the song that everyone anticipates, "My Heart Will Go On", lived up to all expectations & mesmerized the fortunate concert goers.  Towards the end of the song, Celine was surrounded by falling water that artistically cascaded down to make a magical experience, both audio & visual.  Think Fountains of Bellagio in reverse.

Can't have a concert w/o merchandise
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#84ZlgUYEgyq-PDy-eNr-YA

A true showstopper & deserving of headlining the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace,  Celine Dion puts on an extravagant show that will pull the heartstrings & touch you to your very soul.  Her powerful voice wil captivate & strike you with awe as to how such strength can come from such a small frame.  A tremendous show that absolutely has to be experienced before her run is done.

Highly recommend!

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  

Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! 

Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)
with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. 

Happy Eats!

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

DATE TIP: Oui oui!

A cool place to check out AT NIGHT for some cheesy fun! The light show is the main attraction : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=o6mHisZZA0tj7RjX7W1ccw.
Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

*examines my shirt*

Girl: What is "Yelp"?

Aw, shit. Now it's on...

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars "A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks.

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#k0iG_a95OyoEJpJz9Fumsg

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 43/100

Pretty decent hotel. The only time I've ever stayed here was when I was a child so I don't remember too much of it. 

LOCATION: 
More towards the south end of the strip, across the street from New York New York.

EXTERIOR:
Look for the big green building with the big lion in the front. The entryway/lobby/drop off/pick up area is actually not located directly on the strip, but rather around the corner along the cross street that runs perpendicular to the strip.

INTERIOR:
HUGE HUGE HUGE lobby. Much larger than a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's pretty nice! They also have a pretty decent sized casino as well, and the theater where they host the KA Cirque du Soleil show is surprisingly ginormous. I was so surprised that that size of a theater was inside this hotel. 

SHOPPING:
Unfortunately, the shops at this hotel are pretty crappy. Nothing interesting except for a bunch of souvenir shops, and places where you can get everything bad for you - alcohol and sweets.

I feel like MGM used to be good, but with the addition of all of the newer hotels on the strip, it's losing its game. So unfortunate since MGM owns so many of the hotels on the strip!

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today."  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys.

"OK, OK, where we going?"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining.

"Oyster Bar.  Palace Station." is all he says.

"Cool".  Leaning towards my buds, "Did we really feed him fish sperm?"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.

Very Important:

1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait.
2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.

That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.

Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.

Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.

Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.

The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

I have been somewhat flummoxed over how to rate Which Wich.

I believe Which Wich does a nice job making a pricey average sandwich in a quirky feeling store (see photo of the Arrows).

We have been here several times and came yesterday after receiving a coupon by email for a free Regular (Small). My friend used my punch card for a free tenth one.  What that means is that they credit your bill for $5.50.

We both ordered the brown, thinly sliced roast beef. Which Wich defines their sizes as Regular 7", Large 10" and Super 14" You have the option of adding various veggies, or toasting it a la Quiznos. Like Quiznos, Which Wich weights how much meat you get and I would imagine that Regular has about 3 ounces. 

It's only a guess on my part since there is a five foot wall separating you and the person preparing your sandwich.  Why would you not want me to see how you are preparing my sandwich?

My friend's sandwich didn't weight that much when I picked it up.  I ordered the Large 10" (photo) with double meat (a $3.00 up charge). It felt like what a regular would feel like at Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes.  So you are paying $5.50 for a 7" sandwich which has about the same meat that Subway puts on their $3.00 six inch.  Yep I know, it's not really a 6 inches.  

In summary, that's $8.50 for a sandwich which would be $5.95 at Jimmy Johns, or $6.95 at Jersey Mike's (all prices do not include taxes).  Good thing they were comping me $5.50. LOL

My suggestion...  drive a little further down FLW to get a better sandwich and a better deal. Sorry.

Marquee is the newest club to hit Vegas and it is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. A gorgeous club full of gorgeous people! My girls and I agreed that it would be very, very hard for any other place to top it... it was that epic.

The main room will blow you away with its 40 foot LED DJ booth, but make sure you check out all three levels, including the Boombox and the Library - you will be wowed by it all. The Boombox is a smaller underground club with a separate DJ, and the Library is more of an intimate lounge area hidden behind the massive LED screen - complete with pool tables, vintage books and offers more craft cocktails. And if you need to cool off, head outside, where you'll be impressed by the incredible backdrop of City Center views and the fabulous pool cabanas with see-through jacuzzis. 

We received rockstar treatment from beginning to end, and were fortunate to be walked right in. The GA line was scary long. We ended up dancing the night away at the VIP booth right next to the DJ booth, so it almost seemed like we were go-go dancers on stage. It was ATB's first night of residency and it was so amazing to be right there with him. His set was totally nostalgic - remember "Till I Come"?! - we were partying like it was 1999! The dance floor was completely packed with a high energy crowd.

Marquee has really taken the Vegas club to a new level. AMAZE-BALLS!!

When Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:

Breakfast

9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ
10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0w

Lunch

12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg
1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA
3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_w

Dinner

5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA
7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4A

I had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.

Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.

The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.

LOVE The Barrymore!! What a hidden gem and one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas! I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.

Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.

The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, 
peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though.
Book a table here and thank me later!

I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!  

Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.

Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial "Where's the Beef?", while complaining at a burger place called, "Home of the Big Bun".

While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.  

What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.  

Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.

Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?

Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.

I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.

In summary, "Yes, I am a Fan" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches. 

Enjoy!

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words "350 Pounds and Over Eat Free" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or "HAG" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

I hate writing a bad review for an Asian-American owned business, but I feel it is my obligation to advocate for future patients who may suffer from neglectful and unethical practices.

Everything went wrong from the very beginning. At Medical and mental health clinics, it's not common to find unempathetic and distant desk workers. They somewhat need to act like this as a risk management strategy due to the fact that we now live in the era of HIPPA thanks to Slick Willy. But, the attitude at PROCARE was excessively cold and they facilitate an atmosphere which may lead patients to believe that they are at a for-profit clinic that only cares about billing and not your recovery. Funny thing was that when they found out I was a yelper, they started kissing my ass. Suddenly, HIPPA no longer existed and I was a VIP. 

My main issue was due to some of the unethical practices. The Dr. did not see me for more than 2 minutes, and made a rushed assessment. I was prescribed a medication which my body had a severe reaction to. I called the next day, and the uninterested front desk worker told me to "take benadryll" and go on with my life. When I explained the severity of the symptoms, she invited me back for a follow up visit, "FREE OF CHARGE". When I arrived the next day, the front desk girl said that I could not see the Dr. unless I paid. Remember that this is a for-profit clinic, and billing and making money is their number one concern. I was in severe pain due to the adverse reaction from the medication, so I just paid the money and saw the same Dr. The Dr. informed me that I couldn't prove that the medication was causing these adverse symptoms and he claimed I had an unrelated virus that was causing my symptoms. He then prescribes me an "anti-viral" drug and sends me on my way. When I went to the Pharmacist, the Pharm.D(Doctor of Pharmacology) told me that the "anti-viral" medication that was prescribed to me was not in any way an anti-viral medication and that I was given false information. She explained to me that the so called anti-viral medication was a steroid used to treat inflammation from drug-induced side effects. The same drug induced side effects I was experiencing from the prescription medication that  PROCARE claimed was not causing the adverse reaction. I now wanted to get a second opinion so I went to my usual MD in Summerlin who told me that the drug originally prescribed to me has side effects which are absolutely relevant to the symptoms I was experiencing(blistering rash, troubles breathing, swelling eyes, flu-like symptoms, swollen lips and tongue). The MD also expressed that the misleading information that PROCARE gave me could possibly have been an unethical risk-managment strategy. 

I believe the dishonesty and unethical practices are a consequence of the Dr's educational background. I did some research after all of this happened to me. If you google PROCARE's Dr, you will see that he went to an unaccredited medical school which is headquartered oversees, and he got his undergrad in South America. Most states including California, Maine, Oregon, Texas, New York and Indiana declare this medical school an "Institution Whose Degrees are Illegal to Use" or "not recognized or disapproved medical school to practice in state." Nevada is one of the only states that allows graduates from this school to practice. Even the BBC states that the medical school is only operational due to a "loophole which allows them to operate unregulated". These foreign schools recruit many from the US, and present an unaccredited scam-degree. I know from experience, years ago I fell for a scam law program which was headquartered oversees. Every time you see a professional with one of these oversees degrees, just walk away.

I am sensitive to the fact that medical doctors do make mistakes and misdiagnose at times, and the Dr. and nurses are actually very nice... but I am more dissatisfied over the  unethical billing procedures where they led me on to believe the follow up appointment was free to trick me into making the 20 mile drive over there.

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr

The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.

BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible. 

Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate. 

Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! 

I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.

Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger. My journey is now only 1/2 complete as this young grasshopper is ready to fly, again the voices of Dave & Craig come creeping into my mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw#TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw

You must first journey to the East. Search for the Windmill and the Bermuda, the masters told me and you will find the truth.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=qU4VbIgVxtgDi-E6M_KF-w#qU4VbIgVxtgDi-E6M_KF-w 

So grasshopper must learn new technique, to follow big nose. http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA/upload?upload_finished=1&successful%5B%5D=ArW1gUzvm7zPvs1ZuYsf9g

As I drove up with my top down I could smell good things going on inside. 
The masters again spoke to me. " Put up the ragtop or your rent a car will get stolen dummy"  https://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/1PZEIhmTjSzNrMhMfWU6IQ/l.jpg

Finally this journey must come to an end or is it a new beginning?

FOOD:
Kiki's Burger ... Angus Beef, Sauted Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and Garlic Chili Aioli
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cPIFhziwSrVw3V_b4mTs-Q&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-nVIFwtfBMzOLjjubXv4MA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

TASTE:  HELL YEA!
Kiki's Burger ... one hell of a bad boy, a large burger sportin an eartty mushroom taste like an ugly redheaded stepchild at an Irish fair. This was one great burger! A true 5*****Star 

Oxtail Chili Fries ... I've had oxtail spaghetti ragu, soup, pho and even a Jamacian oxtail jerk, but never had it as a chili base before. Its marrow/ gelatin rich flavor is an awesome boot in the pants to an otherwise plain beef chile. I reccomend this for anyone going to Vegas.. It kicks tail!

My masters are calling me back to Anaheim. http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA/upload?upload_finished=1&successful%5B%5D=JqImqMytH8fVTrxRkv14mg

SERVICE:   here is off the hook, you know they got a good thing going and make sure you do too. Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.

I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.

I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!

"My eyes adored you,
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you.
Like a million miles away from me,
you couldn't see,
How I adored you.
So close, so close and yet so far." - "My Eyes Adored You", Frankie Vallie & the 4 Seasons

I loved "Jersey Boys"!!  The musical retelling of how the group last known as "The 4 Seasons" came to be, starting at the humble beginnings of standing underneath a streetlamp in New Jersey.  I'm a big fan of Franki Valli's music & getting to see how he became the multimillion selling, international hit singer had me hooked from the moment the lights came on.

The actor who portrayed Frankie Valli was dynamite!!!.  He hit those high notes like a champ.  To me, he resembled the Brazilian race car driver, Helio Castroneves.  The supporting cast also did a magnificent job during the show.  We had primo seats, 5 rows from the stage, in Row D.  Looking around, all the seats seem to have a good view, but I must say I loved my vantage point.  

FYI, there is typical "Jersey talk" used during the show, aka profanity, & there is also some gun action/blood.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend taking the little ones.  There is an 8 minute intermission with a handy countdown timer displayed on the stage, for those wanting to make sure they get back just in time.

I defy anyone not to sing along & have the catchy songs of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons in their head for the rest of the night & the day after, as well.  I immensely enjoyed "Jersey Boys" at Paris Las Vegas from beginning to end.

I highly recommend you come & catch a performance of one of the greatest shows on The Strip!

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

With suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??

NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!

FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.

BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!

CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!

SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

Oh, Bouchon. I love you oh so much. We usually pick one schmancy dinner during a Vegas trip, and since I'm not one for the over-the-top fancy $500 per person dinners, Bouchon suited me just fine.

First of all, I realize you're supposed to order wine with all things Frenchy, but I've gotta say the cocktails at Bouchon are spectacular. Supremely amazing. I had a Bulleit Old Fashioned - and it was one helluva Old Fashioned.

Of course the service is more than superb. And makes you really feel like it's worth every penny that you're spending. 

The food? Ah. Delicious. I never ever get chicken at a restaurant, but something about the chicken on the menu at Bouchon struck my fancy. And I ordered right. That roast chicken was just superb. So amazing perfect. 

Like I said worth every penny. Sure, it's not quite as pricey as some of the places on the strip (at around $80-$100 p/p), but you'll be in store for a fantastic dinner, that's for certain.

Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago "Red Hot" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: "Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!"  You hear that Mike!

Vdara is a nice hotel, but it is not a 5-star one (as advertised). Some features are nice like the in-room kitchen (that you probably won't use), electronic housekeeping and privacy status, and 2 TVs. It's the little things that make a hotel 5 stars and it is the combination of a lot of small mis-steps that lower Vdara to 3-stars.

 * Check-in/check-out - quick check-in and easy TV-based check-out 4/5

 * Room - decent size with entry kitchenette, and bed on one side of entertainment console/desk and sofa on the other 4/5

 * Bed - King size bed is standard. Couch can be a 2nd bed (good for kids?) 4/5

 * Bathroom - Seperate shower & tub (deep, but narrow with stopper in middle) with 1 sink 3/5

 * Housekeeping - 2 days didn't clean room without calling; 2 bottles of water included, but missing 2/5

 * Amenities - very basic amenities. Bonus: ask for slippers & robe 3/5

 * Pool - basic Vegas pool with stellar service. Older crowd 3/5

 * Parking - Valet only. No Self Parking 2/5

 * Location - you are off the Strip and must go thru Aria, Bellagio, or Cosmopolitan to get to the strip. Why not just stay at one of those? 2/5

 * Atmosphere - Quiet... Really quiet. Does smell great inside & is smoke free 2/5

 * Casino - none. Go elsewhere or stay elsewhere for fun 1/5

 * Restaurants - one lobby bar which is ... a lobby bar 1/5

 * View - we had a partial view of Bellagio fountains and Paris hotel 3/5

 * WiFi - "free" with $25 resort fee; worked in room, pool, and lobby 4/5

 * Value - $25 resort fee + $3 Tax adds up. So do taxi rides to actually go anywhere else. Plan at least $20/day for those, too. 2/5

 * Oddity - On 2nd day, a stranger opened our door with a key and then quickly apologized and left. Called front desk to warn them and was told "it happens sometimes." Well, not to me it hadn't before...

 * Overall - Vdara met our needs for a quiet place to sleep, but it also felt isolated and boring. We spent much of our time going to other hotels ... Hotels we could of stayed at for just a little more than Vdara.

Best way to relax in Vegas before your flight home! They definitely know how to pamper you here. Two words: Free B&B (Buffet & Booze).

The lunch/dinner buffet offers light, delicious options. The highlight for me were the super tender **Braised Short Ribs** served over slow-cooked creamy polenta. Warm, savory, and juicy! Also delightful were the **Spinach & Ricotta Gnudi**, perfect little dumplings with a dash of tomato and basil. A fresh corn salad, roasted zucchini, and arugula salad were flavorful and healthy side dishes. The **Vanilla Honey Panna Cotta with Summer Berries** gave the meal a smooth finish.

A whole array of cocktails welcomes you at the bar. Just take your pick and go relax. Love this perk!

You can get some work done in the conference area or in one of the more private work booths. Or sit back and watch TV in the lounge area. Or take a sweet nap on the comfy reclining personal couches. We opted for #3 -- nap.

The decor is very mod and clean, while the setting is quiet and relaxing. My only complaint is that at one point, two employees began talking pretty loudly in Spanish. The serene vibe was slightly ruined, but I was already so content on my cozy napping device that I dozed off anyway.

Overall the service was phenomenal. You will want for nothing.

TIP: Open to AmEx members only. One-day passes are $50, or complimentary for Platinum members. Thank you, travel buddy!

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

I HAVE URGES... 

"There is a human urge to clarify, rationalize, justify", said Leonard Bernstein. 

That sounds like a good description of Yelp, doesn't it, but that's not the urge I have. 

This definition is a better fit: 

a. An impulse that prompts action or effort. 
b. An involuntary tendency to perform a given activity. 

I have an urge to go to Las Vegas pronto. 

Do I like to gamble? Yes, sometimes. 

Do I like seeing some great shows? Definitely. 

Do I like going to the International CES, the world's largest consumer technology trade show? Oh, yeah, so much fun. 

Do I like staying in some great sexy hotel room on the Strip? You better believe it. 

But none of these are the reason for my urge. My urge is to go to a little nondescript shack located in a questionable, seedy area away from the Strip. The only strip this place is close to is the Olympic Gardens Strip Club that offers male and female strippers, and where lap dances go for 20 bucks. 

I need to go to Vegas because I want me some ice cream from Luv-It Frozen Custard NOW! 

Frozen custard is French style ice cream. It's lower in butterfat and calories than ice cream, and is made with eggs, which gives this indulgent concoction a creamier texture. It also has much less air whipped into it, and there are two types of air I don't like: people full of hot air (no, I'm not telling now) and ice cream full of air. 

I don't even like Sundaes, but at Luv-It Frozen Custard I am simply hypnotized by everything they have. Western Sundae, their most popular - vanilla custard, caramel, salty pecans and hot fudge? Give it to me now, before I get arrested for yanking it from the hands of some unsuspecting Japanese tourist! Bumble Berry Sundae? What's in it? Wait, I don't care, just pile it on! 

Everything is homemade, frozen custard flavors change every few days, so check their website, if you want to know what specific olfactory and oral pleasures to look forward to. Even their website looks hokily homemade, which in this case is just charming and consistent. 

So, if you want some frozen nirvana, if you're tired of seeing same old, same old corporate clones that look identical in LA, Johannesburg, Vegas and Moscow - this is the place for some instant bliss. 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...   I wish Luv-It frozen Custard didn't.

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!
As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. 
That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. 
Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.

Now onto the food shall we?

I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...

Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! 

Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!

Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more 

Butter sauted scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!

Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.

Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! 

Other notable dishes included:
Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2
Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2
Foie gras egg custard 10
Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2
Iberico Pork 10 x2
Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)

All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!

Happy Eats!

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

S is for ... Sexy and Sensual
M is for ... Marque Dayclub & Nightclub
O is for ... Optimal Location Mid-Strip
P is for ... Panoramic Views

I is for ... Irresistible Romance
T is for ... Tantalizing Bars & Restaurants
A is for ... Artsy and Hip
N is for ... Never-ending Naughtiness

Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.

Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).

Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.

Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).

Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.

Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.

The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas may not be a 5-star hotel or casino, but it is a convenient, chic, contemporary, lovely, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip place to celebrate and have fun in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

Right now they are open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 7 am - 12 pm. Admission is free if you are walking in, but $3 to drive in with your vehicle. There is parking right across from the entrance if you decide not to drive in. I grew up coming to this orchard for school field trips as well with family and friends. I love that this place is still here! The area is rich in history, which could take a whole review alone so, I recommend reading up on it sometime and maybe you will appreciate the area even more. They have such a huge orchard that depending on the time of season you come, you really need to dress accordingly especially if you plan on walking through. There is about 60 acres to explore. They have a stand at the entrance if you just want to grab some stuff already picked, or you can take your time exploring the orchard and pick what you like. They provide wagons for you to use.

When I visited yesterday they were offering the following:
Carrots - $1 per pound
Beets - $1 per pound
Cucumbers - $1 per pound
Green Tomatoes - $1 per pound
Apricots - $1 per pound
Squash - $1 per pound
Zucchini - $1 per pound
Peaches - $1 per pound
Honey - $7 for the honey bear and $20 for a quart
Garlic - $2 for 3 bulbs or $10 for 3 pounds
New Potatoes - $2 per bag
Onions - $1 each
Peanut Butter - $6 each
Almond Butter - $8 each 

I came specifically for a honey bear and some peanut butter. Both sell out fast and aren't always available. If you can get your hands on some, I recommend it! The honey is fresh and comes right from the orchard. The peanut butter us a huge hit in our house and doesn't last long.

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

The Cosmopolitan's  "grand social experiment".  It delivers!

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sauted spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

Now if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.

"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN" 

That was one of the first things to pop into my mind when I first heard about our much loved Frost Bites Shavery opening a possible new second location somewhere near Chinatown.  Now that FBS has opened at Seoul Plaza (where you can find: Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Wong, Japanese Curry Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya, Kabuto and that awkward "massage" place where tourists leaves via taxi with a big grin on them faces) rebranded itself as SnowFlake Shavery, the famous partial quote by the American author Horace Greeley  about westward expansion and Manifest Destiny could be applied to our favorite shaved snow biz from Hendertucky.  +2 for just being soooo mucho more closer to the Westsiders. 

For those that have not tried shaved snow from SFS before, it is not the shaved ice you might have tried before with colorful syrups poured over the coarse shaved ice.  It is a more refined icy treat with powder snow or frozen cotton candy-like melt-in-your-mouth experience.  Think shaved ice version 2.3, so to speak.  All made with 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS, no artificial flavorings or syrups used (which is the reason why taro is not one of the available flavors - sadly artificial taro flavorings trumps all natural taro shaved ice made from real taro only).

Ordering 101:

Step 1:  Choose a size: Small, Large, Monster
Step 2:  Choose a flavor:  From Vanilla, Cantaloupe to Green Tea and Black Sesame.
Step 3:  Add a topping ($0.50 per selection):  Fresh fruits to candy and cereal.
Step 4:  Top it off with a sauce (first one free, +$0.25 after that one):  Condensed Milk, Strawberry Condensed Milk, Chocolate and Caramel.

If you are not sure, they also have helpful combos for you to pick from or help jump start your shaved snow creativity.  Although I have had Green Tea and Black Sesame Shaved Snow all by itself, and didn't think it needed any toppings or sauce. It is that good!

Come and try it now that it is closer for everyone that does not live in Henderson.

I think it is better than the ones I tried in SoCal and Taiwan (except the fresh mango from Taiwan is way better).

Here are just a sampling of other real customer testimonials:

Cathy C loves this place, because it is dessert sans guilt.
Sandy K said it is so good it is like [frozen] crack.
Norm K said Mango with coconut sounds good to me!
Philip T thinks he like this more than frozen yogurt now.
Roger T thinks Green Tea + Mochi + just a drizzle of Condensed Milk is dessert heaven.

So what you be waitin' for? Come get some SnowFlake!

DISCLAIMER:  To harry I:  I am not a shill (I am deeply offended by being called that even if I had to first look it up in a dictionary).  And I am not a professional reviewer, but I will take that as a compliment.  And I believe in paying for the products and services from businesses (I want to review the customer service and experience that everyone gets), and writing a honest review of my personal experience.  If I happened to be passionate about it and write the review with flair, all the better.  Being new to Yelp you should read Yelp's Terms of Service, plus the site's Content Guidelines and Review Guidelines.  You can go back to tell your celebrity chef friend that if he is really passionate about the food he serves, he will not be using artificial powders. Is his product bad? NO.  But it is like comparing real orange juice (SnowFlake Shavery) to SunnyD (KSC).

The Cheesesteaks here are now the best I've had in town! There was a flyer put on my door earlier in the week from this place and it sounded good so hubby and I gave this place a try. Hubby actually ordered a "Original Cheesesteak" with cheese whiz, onions and peppers, but I ended up eating almost half of it. I just loved the flavor and enjoyed every bite! The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a "Italian White Pie" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches. The pizza had mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic and caramelized onions. I liked the pizza, but it actually tasted much better re-heated the next day for lunch. The guy who took our order and gave us our food was nice. I'd like to come back and try some of their other pizzas, sandwiches, salads and of course I will be back for more cheesesteak! 

Delivery is offered. Check the website to see if you are in the delivery area. They have different lunch specials daily.

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

I was going to wait for an actual ABBA fan to write their 5 star review but it has been 3 weeks since the show started and people need to be informed dammit!!  My opinion comes off almost like a "significant other that gets dragged to the show" but my wife is not an ABBA fan.  I got free tickets through work. 

Also.....

- I generally despise Broadway shows.  "Rock of Ages" makes me wretch.  
- Never hearing "Dancing Queen" again would be a gift.
- Not familiar with the "Mamma Mia!" story.

The will call booth for Tropicana was a total mess.  It was 50 people deep 30 minutes before the show.  Definitely get there as early as you can to pick up tickets.  We ended up missing the first 15 minutes of the show because of it.  Tropicana either needs to employ more people or have an attendant weed out the people in line who are there to pick up or purchase tickets.  As we walked in, the usher didn't show us to our seats.  She just said "Sit anywhere! The show is about to go on again!".  Ummm..okay.  So I did what any person would do and took the first 2 seats closest to the stage.  The place was about 70% full and it took us about 20 minutes to figure out what was going on in the story.

All the performers seemed perfect for their roles and the singing was well done.  The stage set was pretty basic but you were able to get the idea.  I was most impressed with the live band behind the scenes.  Some of the transitions were tricky and I wished I had a backstage TV a la Le Reve to see them jamming out to "Money, Money, Money" or the almost made for a musical "The Winner Takes It All".    

Tropicana did a great job refurbishing the theater.  The makeover looks terrific.    The bar upfront shouldn't serve wine in actual glasses since I heard a couple of them shatter during the show which was distracting.  There was also 20 minute intermission midway through.

If you love ABBA, I see no reason why you wouldn't love this show.  I observed many attendees clapping along, getting pretty animated during some scenes and even reciting lines.  And if you're being dragged to the show against your will by that special someone in your life..bring a flask?

Ellis Island, you are dead to me!

Oh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.

Ellis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your "center cut sirloin" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into "steaks."

But, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.

I arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a "steak" dinner. We were unenthusiastically "greeted" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.

After a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, "Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?" He got even closer to me and yelled, "No!" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, "Don't threaten me!" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.

Amazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.

I don't write many updated reviews but I believe The Parking Spot deserves some Yelp love.

 I've been using this place for about 4 years and the service is consistently superior. There's covered parking so your car is not baking in the sun so you're less likely to come back with an unbearably hot interior. You get a USA TODAY paper when you enter the facility and a bottled water for each occupant of your car when you leave the facility. That water really hits "The Spot" after being subjected to the heat when you're coming back from a temperate climate. You can sign up for thespotclub which you can link your credit card for payment and keep track of the points you use which can be redeemed for free parking. In fact, I called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because I changed my email address and couldn't get into the site online. For some reason my points were gone too. But they restored my 2,000 plus points within minutes. I guess they thought I was inactive since I hadn't been on the website in years.

All the shuttle drivers are friendly and take care of your luggage (commercial here, Please tip your drivers). They give you a card to remind you which parking space you parked at such as I211. They respond quickly at the terminal when you call and say you are ready for pick up. I usually fly out of terminal 3 so they pick you up at door number 5 on the North side. The vans are air conditioned, what more do you need.

Also, the people that are at the booths are excellent as well. When you call, they know how to answer your question properly. They direct you where to park and take care of your payments at the booth. The Parking spot advertises in the magazines in front of you on your airplane. So you can usually find a coupon for 20% off. I believe a 24 hour stay is $10.95 without coupon. Also, you can get three hours of parking by showing your AAA Card. So if you want to meet people inside the terminal and don't want to pay for airport parking this is what you do. And if you decide to park for more than 3 hours you can use your AAA Card for a 10% discount. They have another service where they'll wash your car by the time you get back. 

There's a Parking Spot 1 and a Parking Spot 2. This review is for Parking Spot 1 on Washington street.

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The dcor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.

The Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.

Their Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.

The Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. 

Service was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it "fully involved" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one "sweet and spicy" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.

During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do "La Mad" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.

Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a "crouton" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyre cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.

And speaking of Gruyre...  The truffled Gruyre Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.

The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with "house made caramel sauce on top".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.  

Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a "bistro" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, "frites", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 

3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good.

We have been to two Outbacks in the last ten years.

It's wasn't because the food was bad; it was just that the experience wasn't anything special.  

We tried the Happy Hour once up at Mayo Boulevard location and left underwhelmed. Recently however we received two gift cards and decided to give them another try.  

Outback has always reminded me of a slightly more upscale Sizzler, mainly because prices are so low.

Last night the three of us started off with Spinach Artichoke Dip for $7.99, Blooming Onions for $7.29 and the Coconut Shrimp for $7.99.  All these were pretty good, though the star was the Coconut Shrimp.  It was served with an orange marmalade/stone mustard sauce which was interesting, but we had to ask for some cocktail sauce in the end. The Blooming Onions on the other hand are still way too greasy for me and clearly they need to rethink this offering.

For our meal, we tried to order the Pork Chops.  But strangely, they had run out (?) this, so we had to substituted for the 1/2 order of Baby Back Ribs ($13.49). They were very good and had a nice smoky taste.  

We also ordered the Filet with Shrimp for $15.99.  We ordered it medium rare and it came out with a pink center and very tender. But as Yelp'er Jody K pointed out in her review -- the shrimp were tiny and way too salty, with some sort of Cajun/blacken seasoning just dropped on top.

Our last dinner item was actually their Short Ribs Nacho appetizer for $6.99.  It had a nice taste and must be considered an incredible value.

So our tab came to $74.60, including a diet soft drink, a nice Chteau St Michelle Riesling, and one of their special Black Sangria. This also included a discount of 50% off one entree that we found on-line as we waited for our drinks to arrive. LOL

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, "the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices."   

This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.

MENU:
Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:
Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50

SERVICE:
As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.

FOOD:
Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.

We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  

On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.

As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  

PRICES:
Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 "Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the "Caliente Burger Combo" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a "Chili Tamale" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories. Thank You Tommy's for branching out of California and making your presence in Nevada!  

 "If you don't see the shack - take it back!"

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

*** Mmm-mmmm .... 
      That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?
      Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef.
      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.

Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.

Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.

Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.

 *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers? 
       Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.

Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.

*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?
      Ah, hit the spot.

Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Crme Brle, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.

Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.

I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

**This place looses a star because I got hasseled for writing this review!!* 
The Heard is many things to many people. 

For Non-natives it is a place to learn about the various cultures of ancient, recent historical and modern Native Culture. 

For Natives of the southwest - it is a place where we are understood and celebrated.

There are so many things I love about this place and I am pleased to share with you my favorite spots in the museum.
- The Navajo Sand painting that is displayed the Navajo Hogan in the Homelands Exhibit. It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.

- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit

- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. 

- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. 

- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history. 

-The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!

When it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! 

There could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.

Their exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.

****UPDATE****
One of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. 

She has said and I quote: "Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic."  and she even goes on to say, "Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]" And what really got me was: "I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items". 

As a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. 

There is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.

Like I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be "let in" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.

To my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture. Open your heart and mind and take in the colorful culture I grew up in!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty "Flash Gordon" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  

If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  

Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  

I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the "Prosciutto San Daniele" since we recently had Carnevino's "Prosciutto di Parma Riserva", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....

Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.

Although the "Veal Chop Saltimbocca" was an impressive looking entre in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  

The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

I've been by several times and loved everything I had each time. The employees are very courteous and make you feel like family when you are there. I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a "Smoked Brisket Sandwich" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of "Cheezy Mac & Cheese" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had "Banana Pudding" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.

She sells seashells by the seashore
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Fried calamari($12)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA
Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins. 

Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody. 

I ordered a "S'mores Martini" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a "Garbage Bowl Salad" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left! 

The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.

P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.

P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

Dating Guide for Dummies, Vol. 4: How to properly club & hit on a group of bodacious bimbos at an A-list Vegas night club.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys "can" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style dcor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.

Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting dcor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. 

I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

Happy Eats!

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on "Sandwich Wars" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free "Mini Cannoli" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said "yeah yeah they get a free mini" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it. 

They deliver!

They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

When I stopped in for dinner the other night, I was surprised to see this place still called Martinez Taco Bar. I came by about 2 months ago and the girl who took my order said they were using the name Martinez Taco Bar for now, but said they would be changing to "Aranda's Taco Shop" and gave me a business card and coupon for a free agua fresca upon their re-opening. I was hoping after 2 months they would have worked out necessary kinks and have the menu in better order. That's something they are still working on according to the girl who took my order this time. it's confusing though because the menus posted on yelp and the menu they have posted on their walls and the printed menus they have out all are different from from the items offered to the price of them. I wanted to try certain things and couldn't because they say they aren't Martinez Taco Bar anymore and are changing the menu around some. Why still use that name after all this time and still not have your menu together? Loco! 

They have a large menu with basically the same thing over and over just in different sizes and maybe a couple different toppings. If you want a basic street taco those are $2 each and come with onions and cilantro. If you want a bit more on your taco and double the meat, the regular tacos are for you. The regular tacos were $3.75 and came with cheese, salsa, guacamole and double meat. They were out of guacamole on my first visit and so they gave me freshly sliced avocado instead and the same thing happened on this last visit. I don't know how they are out of guacamole again, but I have to admit that I really liked the sliced 'cado on my taco and wouldn't mind it that way each time. The street taco had decent flavor and for $2 is a great deal. There is a free salsa bar where you can dress your food as you wish or they have containers for you to fill up what you want if you are taking your order to-go. The price of the regular taco was steep, but it did taste good and I appreciated the amount of stuff inside it. I tried their Al Pastor and Carne Asada. The Al Pastor isn't the best in town, but it was OK as far as taste (a bit overcooked yet had a decent flavor) and something I'd order again if they weren't out of pineapple like they were on both my last visits. The asada was just OK for me, but my hubby did enjoy it. They weren't shy with filling up the asada tacos and that is a plus. There is a good size patio with tables and chairs outside. The food was good, but other kinks still seem to be holding them back in my opinion.

Both visits the soda fountain was out of order. I feel like this place has something, but they certainly have kinks to work out. if they are changing names they should do it and they should have menus that are all the same. It's frustrating to order 3 different things and be told that they don't serve it anymore. Hopefully they will get it together because I'd like to see them succeed being a local family run business. 3.5 stars.

I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.

The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?

About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.

We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.

The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.

The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.

The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

Cost - FREE!

I am from Vegas, so like anyone else that is, or lived here long enough, you more than likely came here for a field trip with school, summer camp or simply with family and friends over the years. We are the ones who know what to expect from the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, so the overpriced chocolates and hot chocolate don't phase us because we know better not to "buy" into that part of the experience. For everyone else, you will learn your lesson once and always know better from there on out, or maybe not? I personally think that locals and tourists see Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden differently and both have specific reasons for going. This is why the prices of what's for sale and size of the tour will not cause me to give a lower rating.

This isn't a place you will be spending a lot of time, so don't plan for it to be an all day event. The chocolate factory and cactus garden are self-guided tours, so absolutely go at your own pace and take in all that you can or you might blink and it will be over. When I first walked into the chocolate factory, I noticed they have a small version of M&M's World now which surprises me they took this long to put that wall of M&M's in priced at $8.99 per pound. All I can figure is people want to say they had M&M's at the actual plant in Vegas and maybe that's why they pay it. If you just ask an employee they will let you pick a color and have a sample, which is free! They are pretty good about letting you try stuff if you just ask. Then you will know if it is something you would actually buy. 

The chocolate tour isn't long. You just walk down a hallway, one side having windows so you can see the equipment and if you come during the day, when the chocolate is being made, you will see it all going down in action. You can read stuff they have posted about how they make certain chocolates and what some of the machines do. At the end of the hallway is what most us came here for. FREE CHOCOLATE! There is usually a sweet lady waiting with free chocolate, but today she was not there! Oh no! Oh well lol. After the chocolate tour, you end up in the gift shop (of course!) where you can purchase a variety of sweet goodies they have to offer which includes a sugar-free section. I always walk through the gift shop to the exit since I don't buy anything and always stop at 7-11 before coming here to get hot chocolate. The hot chocolate here cost $4.95 and is smaller sized. 

The cactus garden is beautiful all year, but when it comes to Christmas time it is simply magical! There are over 300 species of plants and most of them are covered in lights. The lights are done a little different each year because of the growth of the plants, which makes for a bit of something new and not just the same ole thing every time. So many of the plants are covered in lights that I am one of those people that wonder every year "why didn't they fill in that spot?". I saw an article about the guy who is in charge of the lights each year and he mentioned that they have to know their limits. Some branches might break or a cactus might fall over he mentioned if lights were put on them. Makes sense! I will not wonder anymore! If you are lucky you might catch Santa and get to take a picture with him or if he isn't, you can still sit in his chair and take a picture. If you are one of those people (like me) who spends one night during the Christmas season going on a tour of the best decorated houses in town (you can get a current list each year of neighborhoods participating from local radio, paper and news sites) then you should add Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden to your list. It is just like stopping by to see a really nicely decorated house, but it's tons of colorfully and beautifully lit plants. It's free and a fun memory for the whole family!

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100

Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!

GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.

We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.

While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.

I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.

Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.

They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.

What we ordered:

--BREAD--
Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!

--DRINKS--
PIMMS CUP: 
Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.

WYDERS PEAR CIDER:
The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!

--STEAKS--
BEEF WELLINGTON:
So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.

KOBE FILET MIGNON:
My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!

--SIDE DISH--
TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:
I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!

--DESSERT--
STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!

Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.
