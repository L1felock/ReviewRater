I used these guys 3 times so far...the first time I used them it was a hot summer day in August and I remember the owner had a sprained arm wrapped up in a sling. He was out there assisting his team moving furniture with one arm.  Creative moving defiantly exceeded my expectations.

If I could give 10 stars to Conrad, Robert and the team, they earned them! These guys were the greatest! I moved from Scottsdale to South Florida - a difficult move alone with two puppies. Conrad was creative and flexible, solved every challenge; he called me along the drive out, and every step of the way to my arrival. Robert was my "Guardian Angel" on the trip; He made it Fun! (well, as much fun as you can have moving). I so appreciate all the hard work, the integrity and genuine care that they took to get me to my new home. All the "stuff" made the trip in great sted!   Robert and Conrad are the best !!

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

               . ------------.
               \-------------/

                     \&8/
                       \*/

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

I'd like to personally shake Mr Tofu's hand.  While I cannot medically prove it, I am 100% certain that their soondubu contains undefined healing properties.  Some how some way, I always feel better after a meal here.  

Got a cold?  Screw the Nyquil and get the spicy kimchi soondubu.

Bad day at work?  Beef soondubu=good f'n day

Broken leg?  Just splash a little pork soondubu broth on your leg and it'll probably heal instantly.  

Venereal disease?  Wait a couple of minutes before pouring it all over your crotch since it comes out piping hot.  Don't want to scare the other customers with your screaming.  Perhaps the seafood soondubu would be best for this.    

At $8 a bowl, even my wallet feels better!

This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked to see how my pets were doing. I can't say enough about Amanda's Pet Sitting! Amanda followed my instructions perfectly and was always in touch with me and returned my phone calls right away. I've used her services for years now and I'm always happy with her service. I recommend Amanda to everyone I know that has pets.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

They are killing dogs. Abusive. They should not be in business. They are running a tourture ring.Gabby Ugartte -Recently our dog, Shadow, stayed at Green Acres Boarding in Gilbert. When my mom picked him up he was covered in paint and what looked to be chemical burns. Along with a 106 degree fever. They didn't contact our family or the vet and refused to help with any bills despite the fact this was because of their negligence. I want as many people to know as possible that this place is a terrible place for your pets. Please please please help inform people about this place by sharing these pictures or just letting people know. I don't want any other pets lives to be put at risk.

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

Buh, whaddaya mean you don't have chocolate cactus? ;p

Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden is a free & worthwile distraction when you want to be away from the Strip for awhile, but still close enough to head back to continue availing yourself of sinful debauchery and/or losing your entire savings account.  

The Cactus Garden greets visitors as they arrive.  When I went, I admittedly wasn't a huge cactus fan.  I dunno - maybe it's the spines, maybe it's the phallic looking Saguaro cactus.  Cactus just wasn't my cup of tea.  Ethel M has an assortment of cacti on display, which I've read are adorned with lights during the Holiday season.  My horticultural buddy, who collects cacti, has given me various fruiting cacti like the Peruvian Apple cactus, which has made me appreciate the hardy & resourceful cactus.  If I were to go back, I would look at the garden with a more loving glance.

The Chocolate Factory is a self-guided tour.  Visitors read the various displays on the voyage of a caocao bean into fancy packaging.  The highlight of course, free samples!  Halfway through the tour, visitors get their choice of sample - milk, dark or white chocolate.  I may have obtained a couple samples via a few well-timed out walkthroughs ;p  The tour ends in the chocolate shop, with the chocolates fetching a pretty hefty price.  Looking for more familiar choices?Then, on the left is.............

M&M's World!  Purveyor of all things M&M.  Lots of cute lil knickknacks for the M&M lover.  I remember seeing a chess set, which is pretty dope.  It was interesting to see all the items available to buy, but nothing that I wanted to take home.  Now, if they had M&M colored nipple stickers, then M&M's World would be in business.  I'm Asian, so they'd be milk chocolate M&M's ;p
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Overall, a cool free place to check out while you're in Vegas.

Recommend!

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... 

Meats & Seafood
 - Chilled Shrimp
 - Chilled Crab Legs
 - Warm Crab Legs
 - Rack of Lamb
 - Oysters on the Half Shell
 - Prime Rib
 - Sausages
 - Chicken
 - Ribs
 - Mussels
 - Chinese-style Crab
 - Crawfish

Sides
 - Caprese Salad
 - Sliced Pineapple
 - Pho Noodle Soup
 - Turkey Pot Pie
 - Charcuterie Meats
 - Cheeses
 - Steamed Dumplings
 - Creamed Leeks & Lobster
 - Sushi Rolls
 - Cranberries
 - Sliders
 - Bread
 - Crab Benedict
 - Chinese Broccoli

Desserts
 - Fresh Crepes
 - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies
 - Gelato
 - Creme Puffs
 - Vanilla Creme Brulee
 - Chocolate Creme Brulee
 - Buttercream Pops
 - Cheesecake Pops
 - Berry Mousse Tarts
 - Fresh Cookies

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty "Flash Gordon" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  

If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  

Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  

I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the "Prosciutto San Daniele" since we recently had Carnevino's "Prosciutto di Parma Riserva", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....

Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.

Although the "Veal Chop Saltimbocca" was an impressive looking entre in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  

The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

When I stopped in for dinner the other night, I was surprised to see this place still called Martinez Taco Bar. I came by about 2 months ago and the girl who took my order said they were using the name Martinez Taco Bar for now, but said they would be changing to "Aranda's Taco Shop" and gave me a business card and coupon for a free agua fresca upon their re-opening. I was hoping after 2 months they would have worked out necessary kinks and have the menu in better order. That's something they are still working on according to the girl who took my order this time. it's confusing though because the menus posted on yelp and the menu they have posted on their walls and the printed menus they have out all are different from from the items offered to the price of them. I wanted to try certain things and couldn't because they say they aren't Martinez Taco Bar anymore and are changing the menu around some. Why still use that name after all this time and still not have your menu together? Loco! 

They have a large menu with basically the same thing over and over just in different sizes and maybe a couple different toppings. If you want a basic street taco those are $2 each and come with onions and cilantro. If you want a bit more on your taco and double the meat, the regular tacos are for you. The regular tacos were $3.75 and came with cheese, salsa, guacamole and double meat. They were out of guacamole on my first visit and so they gave me freshly sliced avocado instead and the same thing happened on this last visit. I don't know how they are out of guacamole again, but I have to admit that I really liked the sliced 'cado on my taco and wouldn't mind it that way each time. The street taco had decent flavor and for $2 is a great deal. There is a free salsa bar where you can dress your food as you wish or they have containers for you to fill up what you want if you are taking your order to-go. The price of the regular taco was steep, but it did taste good and I appreciated the amount of stuff inside it. I tried their Al Pastor and Carne Asada. The Al Pastor isn't the best in town, but it was OK as far as taste (a bit overcooked yet had a decent flavor) and something I'd order again if they weren't out of pineapple like they were on both my last visits. The asada was just OK for me, but my hubby did enjoy it. They weren't shy with filling up the asada tacos and that is a plus. There is a good size patio with tables and chairs outside. The food was good, but other kinks still seem to be holding them back in my opinion.

Both visits the soda fountain was out of order. I feel like this place has something, but they certainly have kinks to work out. if they are changing names they should do it and they should have menus that are all the same. It's frustrating to order 3 different things and be told that they don't serve it anymore. Hopefully they will get it together because I'd like to see them succeed being a local family run business. 3.5 stars.

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.
