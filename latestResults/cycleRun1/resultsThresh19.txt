Words of Advice:
Don't bond with a stripper right before you are going to get a lap dance.  Knowing about her kids, drug habits, preference of deoderent and relationship with her father does not make the dance more erotic.  I felt like I was getting grinded on by my slutty younger cousin. And that's weird.

The strippers are very nice here and there is a nice mix of real boobies and fake boobies if you like variety.  And if you are a girl you might or might not leave with a hickey for free.  Bonus!

Coach has separate distribution channels for Outlets, which is not the same as you find in their store. These are cheaper, less expensive bags.  So when see the "Now $169, originally $298", keep in mind they were never sold someplace else for $298.00.

Simply put, you can buy it cheaper at Macy's during a sale!  Ugh.

I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

If I can bring home a burrito that satisfies my man and reminds him of home....well, let's just say O Freakin Lay Baby! And by lay, I mean, well, tu sabes loco, tu sabes!!!

Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier. 
If you want your car to go from just a car to something truly special, do yourself a favor and take it here.

This is what a manicure should be! They give you a polish with your manicure and the tools they use to clean your nails - you get to take these home, like a party favor. Granted, prices are a bit steeper at about $50 for a mani. A hot tea was lovely. And my manicurist took her time and it was really relaxing. They use the highest quality products and the spa is lovely. You can use any of the showers/baths anytime during the day of your service.

This Outlet is very similar to Tangers located near Arrowhead.

For the most part, they have all the same stores with a few exceptions.  Two that come to mind is Ralph Lauren Polo and Tommy Bahamas.  

RLP is massive in size and at least two to three times larger than any other of their outlets.  The selection is outstanding.  From what I can deduce, they are taking their department store inventory and just cutting them out entirely.  The merchandise is marked down across the board by 30%, see photos.

Tommy Bahamas Outelt is new to me, though I have shopped at their stores in Kierland and Scottsdale Fashion.  The quality of their merchandise is outstanding.  Another plus to this location is the Saks Fifth Avenue, Off 5th outlet store.

Things you see people buying on the TV commercial for Goodwill:

A flawless 1950s Danish pine nightstand.

A Ouji board game. Missing the board. Seriously.
My bored mother in law.
Me yawning.
And gasping for air. 

Seriously.

This was one STINKY place. I'm sorry. It was hard to stick around and peruse the material past of strangers. But. It's Goodwill, so I can't give it one star. And I bonded with my MIL that day. So add a star.

We came here for a birthday cruise and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly!

It was a cool 100 degrees that day.  The water breezes made it very nice and tolerable.  The boat did have AC, but we just enjoyed our time on the deck and the feeling of floating along with the currents.  

One of the many cool things are the boaters speeding along the lake.  One had a small pup with a life vest sitting out front, letting his tongue hang out as he enjoyed the wind in his face (photo). Hilarious!

Saguaro Lake is a lot of fun, so bring a camera.

Just like in the Goodwill commercial! I swear! You've all seen the commercials right? The customer arrives, ask where, oh, a power drill would be...Goodwill employee says in the tool section and points. Then we see the giddy customer trying on hats, sipping air from a coffee mug, settling into a recliner and finding a backyard croquet set. 

Upon check out the same employee asks "Did you find what you were looking for?" Cut to the giddy customer with a cart heaping full of Goodwill goodies...or as I call them...Goodwillies...and he replies rather happily, "Nope!"

Rickie and I were looking for a bicycle. Did we leave with a bicycle? Nope. But I scored some fabulous seemingly brand new throw pillows for ten bucks. 

Good? You betcha! Will? Will I go here again? You betcha!

P.S. And props for the store not smelling like a nest of moths died under an angora sweater.

I think this place took notes of the complaint of the smoke smell here, cuz as soon as i walked in here, i felt like the place was doused in perfume. I had a headache, and this place made me super nauseous with their overpowering vanilla scent trying to hide the smoke. 
Other than that, the place is beautiful- and has one of my favorite stops in vegas- Jean Phillipe Patisserie. Dude stayed here before for a bachelor party and our friends stayed here also. Thumbs up on their stay. Very modern rooms. 
And more important note again, there is a Jean Phillipes.

Spent a few hours here to recover after a night of XS (pun intended). The facility is clean and they have everything you need (massage, hot tubs, cold plunges, sauna, steam). 

I spent most of my time in the sauna and steam room which were both nice. One negative was the wall of over-engineered computerized massage showers by Kohl. The showers had a complicated computer controlling all the heads and didn't work well, sadly I can imagine they spent a fortune putting these puppies in.

An oasis likes this definitely helps cure Vegas fatigue, glad it was there but it could be even better.

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

Monica Lewinsky

Ok, so now that I have your attention, let's talk about Cafe Teaze. It's a cross between a boba shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop, to some extent. What the knockout for me is their plain milk tea, it is extraordinary. The tea flavor is unmistakably noticeable without being overwhelming. Cafe Teaze unquestionably makes some of the best boba in town. Soft on the outside with a slight chew on the inside, it is carried out to magnificence!

Truthfully, The boba babes in their bikini's and lingerie's are another reason to pop in this budding enterprise. Not only do they look terrific, but they are welcoming and attentive. But please everyone, don't be a male copulatory organ and just come here just to look at the girls, order something like a drink or some food, it's still a business!!!

So in conclusion:

Knock! Knock!

Maybe it's the walking into the kitchen with no apologies or awkardness just a big hello and on with the show. I love the traditional food of the place, my succulent shrimp cocktail , oysters  with hottest horseradish know to man , thick meaty prime rib and a lovely lemon drop cocktail that 
begs me to keep sipping away.  The place just symbolizes a different style and era of dining and I love it. If  they get rid of that red velvet flocked wallpaper I will seriously cry .

There are three free tram systems that operate on the west side of the strip. They're a great alternative to the $5 a ride monorail that runs on the east side. Working north, you can get from Mandalay to Excalibur. Get off at Excalibur and cut through New York New York. Enter the Monte Carlo and jump the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram. I think this one is the more impressive of the trams. While you're waiting for the Monte Carlo tram you can ogle people lounging around Monte Carlo's pool. 

Beat that Toronto Transit!

After getting off at the Bellagio, you can cut through Caesar's Palace and get to the Mirage. At the Mirage you can board the third tram north to the pretty damn ghetto Treasure Island. And from Treasure Island you can then cross the road to the Fashion Show mall.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

I got  so hungry looking at those skinny models all night. I was this close to nibbling on one's boney thigh. The only thing better than eating these scrumptuous works of art, was having them delivered to the terrace at Hotel Indigo. Yes people. Delivered. Right to our drunken butts. On the terrace. At Hotel Indigo. And how fantastic it is that you choose Cheese Whiz, American or Provelone.? I'm all about the Whiz! How cool and funny and useful is that?

We hired this company recently to unload a Broadway Express trailer on a very hot Sunday afternoon in July.  Thankfully, Conrad was happy to provide a crew for our move despite it being on a Sunday and despite us not knowing an exact start time.  Both Conrad and Jessie were great on the phone and were so kind and flexible with our situation.  When our crew arrived, we were thankful for their hard work and their desire to make sure we were satisfied.  Rene did a wonderful job and we really appreciated the hard work of the crew.  If you are looking for a reliable moving crew in the Phoenix area, you really can't go wrong with Creative Moving and Packing!

I have to report that I just walked out of this restaurant after waiting a good 5 plus minutes for a server to show up. I was especially convinced when I looked over at the other table's greasy looking pizza. Eek! Methinks not.

Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.
Hans Christian Andersen

I was going stir-crazy after living four years amidst the sand, heat, concrete and LED lights that compromises most of what I know as Las Vegas. I love Las Vegas, it is home, but one thing I miss, living in this great city of ours, is nature. Sure, we have the breathtaking desert, but I need trees! I need water. Birds that go quack. Little slippery things that swim and taste good. I need Sunset Park. 

This little square mile or so of paradise has been my haven. It has everything I need, a manmade lake, hiking trails, frisbee golf, and GRASS. LOTS OF GRASS. Hello allergies, how I missed thee (in a weird way). On mornings when my insomnia is raging, I try to walk the mile-long obstacle course, as it clears my head and soothes the mind. The place is a soul saver.

VIP. Hmm. It must stand for Very Icky PooPoo. Yep. That's what it means. I mean really, how cliche, a stinky, stinky, cab. What is this? New York? Thank God all the windows were down, because this was some serious BO. All the Right Guard in the world would not have helped this man. I'm thinking, perhaps, a good ole Silkwood shower may do the trick. 

So. Stinky cab arrives driving like a bat out of hell. I thought we were going to be run down like those folks at the Farmer's Market in Santa Monica. But we jumped in, breathed through our mouths and prayed for a non fatal journey. 

So Stinky. That's my nickname for him, drove like a drunken Helen Keller on a mission to hit every possible pothole from Kobalt to The Clarendon.

I would say one star. But, hey, we did indeed arrive alive. And now I have this not so positive yet colorful review to enjoy. So. Two stars. 

"Thank you for calling Very Icky PooPoo Taxi. How may I help you..."

A bar with one of the best views around that serves up amazing cocktails as well?! If I lived in PHX, I'd be taking all my dates here. Gorgeous, cozy, romantic... LOVE IT!

The bartenders are all very friendly, and they are fantastic mixologists. I absolutely loved my Bourbon Sidecar. And you can get a little piece of SF here - yes, they have Fernet!

Located at Sanctuary Resort, you can enjoy drinks inside the swanky lounge or even better - take your cocktails outside onto the secluded patio, get comfy by the fire pit or under a heat lamp and star gaze.

SWOON.

Since my previous review about the new corporate version of this once loved establishment was flagged and removed i'll try again. It was removed  "because it does not contain a new firsthand experience with the business." Now why they think it wasn't based off of an experience is beyond me. (mind readers maybe??) 
Anyways, this is not the "Original Penguin" that gained all the acclaim. Notice the "TM" after the name now. 
It is a lame, shell of a version of the restaurant that once lived. Wait staff was inattentive, food was greasy, I don't expect it to last long. 

If you are looking for food inspired by the original Penguin, try Pinkys Westside, or The Diamond. Corporate entity's have no business swallowing up a local legend, and demanding the same respect of the community, please support local business.

I would like to try this place, but they are unresponsive to customers.  It seems that they tried to advertise with Groupon, and then didn't actually like it when customers tried to redeem their Groupons.

--Did not answer the phone repeatedly
--Actually spoke to her once, and she told me to text her.  I texted, got no reply.
--Showed up at the restaurant at 4:30PM on a Saturday, and the doors were locked.  No answer to knocking or calling the phone.  
--Other customers were outside, waiting.  One couple actually had a 4PM reservation, and was still waiting outside nearly an hour later.

Tina's Ethiopian Cafe is not treating their customers with respect, and this is unacceptable.

Full Disclosure: I've thrown 2 events here

Fuller Disclosure: I'm now a member and will review from that vantage point

Fullest Disclosure: I didn't shower yesterday

Any who, I joined this studio for a reason... It's the most spacious yoga studio I've been in and it offers hot boot camp. I have no patience for yoga (ironic), so the fact that I can get a workout and sweat out all the shame from nights prior is very appealing to me. These classes are GRUELING, but you feel amazing afterward. The instructors are animals, but don't mind if you need a break or have to grab some air. They get it. It's f'n hot. There are 2 boot camps a day , so it works with most schedules. After your class you can hit the locker room for a shower and not feel cramped in the least. They provide towels, shampoo, soap, etc. so no need to bring any extras. 

Into hot yoga? Bored of the gym? Hit up 103. Not sure if it's for you? Sign up for the 30 days for $30 special.

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

"Lord help me," is what was going through my head the moment I approached this 'beach club.' It is not really a beach club as there is in fact no beach. There is a pool... And there are some places to sit down, but only if you are willing to fork over several THOUSAND dollars for those precious seats. Otherwise you are forced to lay your towel practically in the planter and jam into the pool where there isn't an ounce of swimming, only people rubbing up against one another attempting to dance? I think? I hope?

Anyway, if you are looking for a relaxing pool environment than avoid this spot at all costs! If you are looking for a nightclub during the day with people practically naked, then you have found your haven.

I can only offer praises... yes, it can get busy, but it's worth the wait.  The spa pedicure has everything I could want... callous, sugar scrub, hot towel, and my personal fave... paraffin.

It's like that line from Karate Kid, "Get him a body bag!"... yes, I would love to fully immerse myself in that toasty elixir of softness... even m'lady parts.  It's like Snuggle for your epidermis... but alas, they'll only agree to wax your feet... which is good enough for now.

They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.

They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.

And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty.

Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Been there once... and that's okay for me.

I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and a large soda for $7.77. They have that soda dispenser that can deliver just about any soda known to man. They were out of the Diet Dr. Pepper so I was saying no bueno until I saw that they had Diet Barq's Rootbeer. Nice save!

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.

Rooms at LVH are inexpensive, additional amenities are very much the opposite (wireless is thirteen dollars a day, a single quart of Crystal Geyser is four), rooms are clean and pleasant, et cetera, you can read about that stuff in any of these reviews. 

More important than any of that is the sheer amount of nipple slippage going on outside. If you are lucky enough to have a room facing the pool, park yourself in front of a giant picture window 'round happy hour and check out the free boob show*. 

Three stars!

*or maybe show a little restraint and don't act like a huge creep/me. Whatever floats your boat.

H&M. Must stand for Happy and Man. Cuz that's what I was after my shopping spree here recently. We scored three pairs of pants and three or four shirts for $150. And I'm talking styling threads dudes! Not some Buffalo Exchange leftovers. Loved that the men's section is on the entire first floor, right when you walk in. It's kind of divided up into three sections, with plenty of merchandise but not so cluttered you accidentally brush up against a strangers boobies while navigating the aisles. Would have liked a better selection of sunglasses (HELLO THIS IS ARIZONA) and belts (HELLO...Oh, I don't really have an end to this one...).

Amex's Centurion lounge gets 5 stars not only for being very accommodating during my  6 hour delay, but for being one of the finest domestic airport lounges I've had the pleasure to enjoy in awhile. 

From a computer fax station, full bar with premium beer, spirits and wine,  gourmet buffet including Scott Conant of Scarpetta fame's fine cuisine, coffee and refreshments,  to multiple spacious lounge areas with cushy loveseats, private lounge pods with charging stations, kids play zone, chaise lounges looking out into the Tarmac and more, this lounge is pretty much has it all. I know ill most likely be frequenting this one as opposed to the smaller Club VIP Lounge located in the same terminal. Additionally, I'm allowed up to two guests as opposed to a 25$ charge for additional guests at the other lounges. 

It's one of the great perks you get being a valued Amex card member.

Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:

- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership
- Build an organic  farm in my backyard
- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables
- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes
- Get a restaurant business license
- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property
- Grow a full, luxurious beard

I had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. 

Instead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! 

I do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.

I was forced to eat at the Black Fig Bistro since the Pink Floyd cover band brought out an army of people to the casino. Every restaurant was filled to capacity with over one hour waits.

So I ordered a chicken burrito with fries. The burrito was flavorless and the fries were decent. I guess I should have ordered something else but "if you don't eat you meat you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding, if you don't eat your meat?"

I'm not driving around town in the car I reserved because when I got off the plane (at 3 am), you didn't have it. 

And I'm like, "Fuck you."

I guess the money I paid wasn't enough...I'm like, "Fuck you."

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari...
All I wanted was a Nissan Versa in white. 
Too much to ask, for you to honor your commitment...
The way you play your game ain't right.

Clearly, Advantage knows how to TAKE the reservation, they just don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.

He is our 'go-to guy' for everything... paint, drywall, hanging chandeliers and ceiling fans, reworking electrical, fixing kitchen and bathroom plumbing, and more.  He's more than affordable, extremely professional, and personable as well.  He's fantastic with dogs, and trustworthy enough that we feel 100% comfortable leaving for the day with Duane in our home.

Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.

Jabbawockeez joins forces with Super Crew (who were throwin' up that tell-tale 'S' with their hands) in an explosive, high energy show. 

I wasn't an avid watcher of ABDC (unlike the screaming fans behind us) but I'd seen it enough times to know I was in for an evening of breaking, poppin' & lockin.' The show turned out to be so much more; audience participation that was really funny (& sometimes quite sexy), a storyline about what a janitor dreams is possible & a diverse soundtrack for the masked dancers to showcase their talent to. 

There is a glow-in-the-dark sequence that is especially memorable; a skit that pays homage to ninjas & martial artists from another era. The dancers put their spin on everyone from NKOTB to queen to beyonce (hilarious!)

The show actually starts when you are in line to enter the Monte Carlo theater, so get there a little early. We got tickets at the tix4tonight booth--about $49 a person, 3rd row. If you are tired of paying Cirque prices & want to see a show that's more upbeat, Mus.i.c is a fantastic alternative. Hell yea, five stars for an entertaining evening! Show is about 2 hours without intermission.

Owner: 
Hi,
This is Wes From Polished Nails and Spa on Rainbow Blvd...
I believe youve left negative comments on the wrong Salon. You may have intended to comment on a differant Polished, whom we are not affilaited with. Our staff is all Vietnamese and we never have had a tabitha here. Would you consider deleting the comment?

Wes


My reply:
Hi Wes,

No I did NOT write a comment on the wrong salon. In case you didn't see the stars it wasn't negative it was NEUTRAL. 

As far as "Tabitha" is concerned... if you actually read the post, you would see that I was referring to a television show... and when I got my brows waxed that day... it was funky.

I have come to Polished several times since that review and HAVE had good experiences; however if this is how you treat your clientele and choose to be someone who censors others about their own personal opinions, congratulations you have lost a customer and I am cancelling my appointment for Friday.

If I could give this place a negative stars, I would. I witnessed blatant prejudice, discrimination and slight racism. I never got any eye contact from "Brian" and was treated with disregard for an entire 30 minutes. During this time of disgrace, I personally witnessed the bouncers tell ppl they had to get bottle service to get in (aren't attractive enough)  and the best? Informing an inter racial couple (female) she can't get in because she was with a guy who had cornrows. Oh interesting.

Planes taxi on runway for ever!

22" wiener, $27, meh. 
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A

I know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. 

Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. 

Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.

Ok, most people hate going to the laundromat to do their laundry.  I have no choice but actually like coming here.
This place is super-clean with a friendly staff (mostly Spanish-speaking but I'm fluent so THERE :P).  There are *no* pigeons running around this place.  Always a plus!
You use a card here, no quarters dug from under the couch cushions.  I like that.  
The place is spotless.  There's always someone cleaning up.  The machines are regularly cleaned out of forgotten socks and panties.
They even have a little store with a variety of different detergents!  
They are open late, which seems to be when I go there.  Many TVs throughout, tuned into different stations.  There's even a PacMan machine to play!

The steaks are SUPERB. Shared the 24oz porter house with my date. I do wish I would've asked for sauce on side. Excellent wine choices. I have to agree this is one of the best steak houses. Can't wait to go back.

"Just Say No!" has been around for years to protect our children from drugs.  Well, if you are over 18 there is one drug you must try...Absinthe, the best show at Caesars Palace.  If you want to hear Celine...watch Titanic.  The best entertainment at Caesars is this "trip" of a lifetime, without a drug test. The venue is a 1800's wooden/stain glass tent from Belgium, set outside at Caesars Palace.  The interior is dark and mysterious with wooden chairs around a small stage and a bar.  The air is that of a freak show and you are waiting for the Elephant Man to come out. Go early and enjoy the whole venue, which includes a very eclectic outdoor lounge filled with artwork and sculptures that are a cross between a haunted house and Alice in Wonderland. The New York Times has called this show Cirque du Soleil meets Rocky Horror.  The acts are so intensely entertaining that you are either crying from laughing or praying on your knees that nobody gets hurt from their amazing feats of acrobatics and stunts.  This show is by no means for the timid.  The performers are so talented and death defying, you experience that sensation of driving by a car accident where you don't want to look but you just HAVE to.  Just say YES to Absinthe!

Great photo spot if you can get a clear view between people passing by. 
I always think of Oceans 11, and watching the show either at night or day, i like to take that moment to just clear my head of the smoke and slot machine chatter and just enjoy the show!

Hands down best dim sum in the Valley. I've taken different groups of friends here on EVERY Sunday in the past two months, skipping only Easter, and have eaten like it's my last meal on Earth every time. All of my friends including Alex loved it and agree that it's the best dim sum in town right now. It's totally worth it even with the long drive from North Scottsdale and ridiculous weekend highway closures. Looks like I might be there again next Sunday...

Oh no!  I only just saw that they closed down when I decided to post long overdue pictures of one of my favorite treat spots on The Strip!

At least I still have a super cutesy apron from this place to remember them by.  My favorite cupcake of theirs was the Kir Royal.  It was described as a moist raspberry cake with bubble champagne buttercream.  Every cupcake I have ever gotten from them was moist and airy.  The buttercream can get a tad on the sweeter side but it's nothing you can't fix by removing some of it off.  This place loved using the edible glitter as well.  

Oh well.  I'll keep warm and fuzzy memories of The Cupcakery in my thoughts.  Farewell, old friend!

Kabuto is certainly the new sushi sheriff in town.  As far as local sushi joints go, nothing can match their quality, preparation, care and detail.  The look on my face after my first bite of toro rivaled Arnold Schwarzenegger's face in "Total Recall" when his eyes were popping out.  Would've been a classic profile picture!

I did the omakase and everything was great.  I plan on just getting the nigiri courses and then just ordering additional nigiri since that's all I want the next time.  Maybe an order of toro with a side of chu-toro.  

Make your reservation on Tuesday or Friday since they get their fish shipments from Tokyo on those days.

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  

As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."

Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]

The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)

What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.

Adam...lead on!

OK. Just so you know. When they arrive at your door with your ice, they've already heard "OH!. THE ICEMAN COMETH"! Or "OH, IT'S SO nICEEEEE TO SEE YOU"! Or "ICE ICE BABY ICE ICE BABY"! Hey, I'm just looking out for ya. I have to say, AZ Iceman has saved my icey ass on more than one occassion. Usually the ice machine next to my office is so loud producing cubes I fear a major hail storm has moved in and nobody has alerted me. Lately. Not so much. She's a tempermental one, that ice machine. So a call to AZ Iceman yields an always polite employee who quickly dispatches the Iceman. Soon my cocktails, teas and sodas are fizzy, happy and cold once again. Like Liza Minelli on her wedding night. I don't know what kinda deal you would get, but I shelled out around $70 for 400 pounds of ice. Yes. You heard me. Four hundred pounds. It's like having Carney Wilson delivered, only in the form of ice cubes. I c u soon.

Chandler Fashion is a nice upscale Mall and one of the best in the greater Phoenix area,

We've been coming here for over five years, longer if you count before we moved to the Valley. It's your typical double decker setup, with the usual anchors like Macy's, Sears, Dillard's, Nordstrom and Barnes & Nobles built in a semicircle.

In many ways, we like Chandler Fashion over the one in Scottsdale with the same name. Scottsdale Fashion has been built-out, piece meal and can be crazy busy at times.  The developer of both is Westcor, a sub of giant real estate holding company Macerich. 
 
Here the movie theater setup makes more sense. It's outside and has a group of restaurants attached to it. So you can stop and eat, before or after your movie. Also, because it's located it's easier getting in and out without the necessity of walking through the Mall.  Nice!

Enjoy the shopping.

$170 for a ticket right smack at the center of the lower section less than 24 hours before the show's sold-out performance.  Yes, I was very lucky, and the show was worth every penny.

I think the best way to describe the show is with the use of adjectives:

amazing
beautiful
colorful
daring
fantastic - O (thanks Luis C!)
magical
magnificent
O-mazing (thanks Earl G!)
stunning

Oh, who am I kidding?  Janice C. is absolutely right.  There are no words to describe the grace and beauty of this show.  You'll just have to check it out the next time you're in Las Vegas.  Highly recommended, I left the theatre that night in complete awe!

So. Fabulouso! I'm cereal. From the chips and salsa to the green chile cheese crisp to the endless parade of margaritas and shots of tequila right down to my bean tostada, out of this world tamale and cheesey cheese ensheelotta....

Well...

If it were legal to marry a restaurant, I would seriously consider courting Via Delosantos. But it's not. Can't marry a goat. Can't marry a gay. Can't marry a restaurant. 

We had attentive and friendly service and was informed because it was 9:30 it was last call. So we ordered up! Went with my besties who are regulars so I feel as though we were extra pampered. 

Extremely generous tequila list. Comfortable and cozy decor. Clean restrooms. Great company and delicious food.

Let it be known... flash mobs are not allowed at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I learned this the hard way and I am no longer allowed to set foot in my go-to shopping mall for the next year.

Despite the "no flash mob" rule, I've been a loyal customer for years.  SFS is a shopper's paradise.  It has pretty much everything you might be looking for from Nordstrom, Neiman's and Macy's to Crate and Barrel, Banana Republic, Anthropology, Hugo Boss, Tiffany, etc... They also have a movie theater and food court and lots of other restaurants to choose from including Z' Tejas, Fred's at Barney's, Modern Steak / Modern Burger, Grand Luxe, and more.

356 days left until I can set foot in Scottsdale Fashion Square again... until then, I'll be spending my $$ at local boutiques, the Biltmore Fashion Park, Scottsdale Quarter, and Kierland Commons.

Feel free to PM me for a link to the aforementioned flash mob if you haven't seen it yet... and happy shopping!

A Sweet Review for a Sweet club...

1. It was my boy Kent D's birthday and he wanted to party like a Rock Star...indeed we did...twice over.  We got bottle service inside the club and in the middle of the madness which is the best way to rock it out at XS. 

2. Before we got blitz and started fist pumping, we tipped the 300 lb bouncer so he can keep an eye on us and our table. Luckily we did because some guy tried to help himself to one of our Goose and the bouncer put a smack down on his A$$. 

3. There was plenty of talent and a few bums. Get rid of the bums (thanks 300lb bouncer) and keep the talent.

What happened in Vegas was on a few cameras... need to find and delete...

Late November...
The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning,
And I'm surrounded.
Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens,
Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks.
Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told,
Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing
Here and there and here and there...
The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round,
Orange-slice garnishings.
Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille,
Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all
Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons,
Hosted.

Here, you recline.

And at noontime sharp,
Our Happy Hour,
Suggestions, recommendations, libations...
Fives and sixes, listed mixes,
And fondues and sliders
And caesars and ritas.
Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas...
Verrado Grille makes your stay easy.
The game's not over, however.
So stay awhile.
Enjoy
The moment and the
Smiles
Surrounding
You.

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

I've broken up with frozen yogurt.  Boba? Boh-bye.  Haagen Dazs can go fahrvergngen themselves.  This is it!  This is my go to dessert destination in Las Vegas.

There have been so many glowing reviews by a lot of reputable Yelpers that it seems ridiculous that I could add anything else into the mix.  Even though my review of their business when they were known as "Frostybites" expresses my sentiments clearly, I love the Ex-Straw-Binary that much to say it again.

It's probably not the most popular flavor but for some reason, it's the perfect sweet spot for me.  When you combine their shaved strawberry ice with strawberries and then strawberry condensed milk on top of it all, it's like the strongest, sweetest musical note.  

If the Ex-Straw-Binary were a guitar solo, it would be Adrian Vandenberg's solo from the Whitesnake classic "Is This Love".  The tone, the sustain, the subtle power of it all.  I eat it up.  It IS love!!

I do feel a little looney sometimes getting the same thing over and over (I've gotten the pumpkin twice with graham crackers which is a solid 2nd place) but I get over it and get it again.

History is important especially for the things that Pittsburg has gone through. This is by far the best place in PA for a good lesson on the local history and culture. At least once a year every citizen of the state should take this tour and learn where everything came from. 

This is for anyone who enjoys nature, learning, and day away from the television. We believe in a certain way of life and this tour is filled stories and insights that make that life very special. 

The guide was very happy to answer all my questions and it was interesting to see how steel was made. it was so nice to meet all the new curious people on the tour as well.

My ode to Estelle Getty:
Picture this. Scottsdale. Hotel Indigo pool. 
A middle aged gay man holding a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc runs to make a photo opp at Rickie's fashion show.
He didn't realize the three svelt female models with air bags for breasts were nude. Naked. Sin ropa! Nada lotta!
Except for their bikini-painted bodies. Yes. Body paint. 
By the pool. Me. Them. Slippery floor. Slippery glass of wine. 
As the photo is being snapped, I find myself losing my balance and I think, as I was going down with the wine, I should grab on to someone's clothing. To brace my fall. In front of hundreds. 
Well. They're nude. There is nothing to grab onto. Me and the wine go down spilling wine on all three of the models.
Causing their body paint to start streaking! SNAP goes the photo. 
Oh. Hotel Indigo? The services? Valet guy parked my car. Hostess greeted me. Bartender overserved me. The models hated me. 
Good times...

I always try to keep my fitness in gear when traveling on biz.

Vegas with all it's sinful temptations of food and drink can ruin it for me so I always try and hit up a casino gym while staying there. The Grand Spa at MGM was a decent little gym with some nice equipment. Very well kept, plenty of cardio, and a good line of machines, dumbells, and some cable equipment. Also on hand are complimentary bottles of water, fruit, and assorted Nature Valley granola bars. 

Hours: 6:00am - 7:00pm Monday - Thursday, 6:00am - 8:00pm Friday - Sunday

Overall, nice gym for a casino with plenty of equipment. $10 a day gym only fee is a deal.

Creme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.

You are not trippin'. It's June in Vegas and over 100 degrees out and it is straight up snowing. Snow ice that is. I don't really know how to explain it, but here it goes.

It's creamy, but not firm like a gallon of ice cream that breaks your spoon or fork or whatever your ice cream weapon of choice is. It's a light creamy.

A light creamy like that of Common's skin. Yes, he is some HOT ass Chocolate. Not light like an ice slushy.

Light like when a girl lightly tip toes out of the bedroom and away from her lover in the morning to brush her teeth and wash away the drool so she looks fresh. 

None of that has anything really to do with Frost Bites, but I don't care. I love Frost Bites for being that delicious dessert I never knew I was missing. At 150 calories for a kids size I think I found my summer crush.

Much creamier, smoother, denser & better tasting than Luv it custard. But it started to melt pretty quickly after receiving it from the front cashier. 

Got the caramel pecan concrete custard very creamy. The pecans were yummy & gave it a great texture to the custard. It was a bit on the extreme sweet side. 3.5 stars

Chocolate malted walnut was pretty good but the malt gave it a funny taste & the walnuts were not fresh. 2.5 stars

Lime rickey was yummy tasted like a lime & cream popsicle.

Overall taste: B - (can be a too sweet...after a couple bites, I was on a major sugar rush). -1

Service: A (helpful) 

Inside decor: A (very kool with all kinds of 50s memorabilia)

Overall great place to visit on a hot day. =)

Okay, so I'm realllyyyyy freaking picky when it comes to my wings. I don't do Hooters wings. I don't do Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't do Pizza Hut wings. I think I've only had one dozen wings that I went kind of nuts over... and that was yesterday at Long Wong's.

Luckily, one of my girlfriends knew how ridiculous I am when it comes to wings but insisted we check this place out. Ghetto area. The girl at the counter wore black lipliner. The customers looked like they just got out of prison...

HOWEVER! The wings were out of this world. Saucy, full of flavor, and cheap. Extra veggies, extra ranch... no charge. We ate so many wings + chili cheese fries, and I felt like a heffer when we were done. SUCCESS!

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

Last night's Carrot Top show had to be the most hilarious comedy performance I've attended in many years.  I never thought I was a fan of his until last night.  Some of his stage props are goofy and some just left me puzzled, but most of them were just downright funny.  He made good use of the video board behind him to accentuate a number of his jokes and the sound props were all right on.

As expected there were jokes and props about sleeping pilots, Tiger Woods and the big rodeo happening right now in Vegas.  Whenever a string of jokes failed Carrot Top went right back to the cock ring jokes to reel the crowd back in.  If you have two hours to spare check out Carrot Top's show at the Luxor.  The show is dark on Tuesdays so if that's the case stand in front of a mirror and make fun of yourself.  It seems like that approach has worked for Carrot Top.

I hate being a hater but that was a 2 star experience.  They can't compete with the big boys down the street.  

My wife got the tonkotsu ramen and while the broth was decent, they gave her thin noodles which she didn't like at all.  The server didn't even offer a choice and the thick noodles in my deluxe were way better.  The deluxe definitely wasn't skimpy on ingredients but the broth was bland and the charsiu was just OK.  I would have ordered the deluxe with tonkotsu ramen or shoyu (soy sauce) if I could do it again.  

What's up with no music in the restaurant?  I felt like I was eating ramen in a library.

Is 3 stars the new 2 stars?  Even the 3 star reviews are telling readers to go elsewhere.

Yep. David B. Once again the wise sage atop Mount Yelp. I called another locksmith who never returned my call. I called Stagecoach and they said they could help me tomorrow. That's cool. I had a safe in my office and the batteries died and I was unable to open the safe. But you have to open the safe to put in new batteries. Suckky I know! Stagecoach called back and said they can be here in an hour. YEE HAW! Stagecoach to the rescue. I expected a horse and buggy with a rugged Michael Landon (post bed wetting problem, pre Little House on the Prairie...c'mon he was a hottie!) to pull into my parking lot and save the day. Well. That didn't happen. On accounta he's dead. But it was a man named Dean. Lean, mean Dean! No. Not mean at all. He fixed my safe. Installed new batteries at no charge. Yep. Free. Last time I got free batteries was at Castle Boutique when I bought a...oh...wait...my mom reads these reviews. Anyhoo. You got key issues. Lock is jammed. Or your office safe is on the fritz.

I used to live on Long Island, so I know a little bit about bagels. This was good, but it wasn't a classic Brooklyn bagel. Maybe it's the water here in the Charlotte area? It was still a good bagel, toasted with some scallion cream cheese.

The coffee was good too.

Nice that they have a free wifi. Comfortable seating area, maybe a nice place to chill with a laptop for a bit.

My only complaint is that when the gal asked me for the combo, it looked like it's supposed to come with a couple of mini-muffins. No biggie - I don't need that many more carbs!

My wife had a grilled hot dog and sweet potato fries while I had a Chicago Hot Dog, waffle fries and a soda all for $21.91.

The food was good, but I was shocked by the cost of our lunch. I guess those prices might stick when the captive movie going crowd is looking for a quick bite before the movie but this local knows where there's a better bang for the buck at some other eateries in the area.

I am spoiled now and will probably only view future movies at a Galaxy Theater. I don't live close to either one however I find the trek is worth it. The standard ticket cost $11 which is about the same as anywhere else. I usually go to see movies at The Palms which is $10.50 so no big deal. Unless you go to The Palms on a Monday when it is $5, anyhow lol. 

I love the assigned seating, I love the big spacious comfy lazyboy like reclining seats. I mean I was literally like laying down watching the movie! They have big trays where you can put your stuff as well.

The staff is cool, the Theatre is very clean and the sound is Amazing as well.

It was a fun experience and I will be back for sure!

The head  baker here is a bad  mutha--shut yo mouth!!! 
I was referred here by an unnamed source who decided they'd had enough of me and my so called diet and boy was this a diet buster
First off, the thing that impressed me out of nowhere was the tres leches. Usually buying tres leches from somewhere other than a Mexican bakery usually ends in a sugary wet disaster, but when they pulled it off, I knew we could be in business

The cream of the crop, at least to me were the mini pies. I always love eating pies by myself so making one smaller was only the next logical step, and I must say it almost brought a tear to my eye. Me and my food brother took bites out our pies and then gave each other that look that only a fellow secret food beast will understand. Needless to say those pies went off to the great bakery in the sky
Long story short, get here, eat some pastries then walk out like a boss

Where all the ez katz are flockin'
Drop, pop the collar lockin'
All shades of colors hoppin'
To the beats that be rockin'

$6.00 was the door fee
Stiff drinks? Yes please!
Shots of Patron I was takin'
In hopes of later dirty baby makin'
And even morning breakfast serving bacon?

Only complaint is the restroom
Very slimy, tiny, and grimy

She sang with soul and funk
Nothing dull or bunk
Damn, I'm gettin' drunk!
Singing some James Brown
The crowd was gettin' doowwwnnn
No one with a frown
Up in this Blue's town

I danced and got jiggy
Flirted like Miss Piggy
With all this fun
Under the sun
I was done

But I'll definitely be back
Ready to attack
This place was so cool
Not at all whack

Eyes were closing shut
Baby making, what? What?
Not tonight, don't wanna to fight
Can barely stand with all my might
Losing sight
Gooooooood night!

I see this place has closed. They always had a sign out that read "Opened for Breakfast". But they were never opened for breakfast. I ate there once and had a burger and fries and did not go there again since the food wasn't the greatest.

Tix 4 Tonight is a must for those wanting to catch impressive discounts on shows, attractions & meals.  Customers can save up to 50% off the premium pricing that Las Vegas attractions demand.  I utilized Tix 4 Tonight to purchase vouchers to Beatles Love, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, Donny & Marie and Flavors buffet at Harrah's.  Once I acquired said vouchers, I just had to go to the box office of the particular show to secure my tickets.  Let me tell you, I scored primo seats for Beatles Love and Donny & Marie.  For Beatles Love, the show is in the round, so good seating is available throughout.  The only catch with Tix 4 Tonight is vouchers can only be obtained either the day of or the day before, since it's a discounter that's attempting to sell unsold tickets.  If you want to make sure you secure tix to a show or you want the very best seats, then I suggest buying them ahead of time through the box office or vegas.com.  However, if you're looking for something to do in Vegas, then I highly recommend visiting one of the many Tix 4 Tonight locations located on the Strip.

I remember when I first bought my first MIcahel Kors bag and folks were like MK what's that? A couple months later. When I got my mom a Micahel Kors watch, it was the same. Nowadays, Michael Kors is the IT Brand.  Folks are posting about it on Facebook, Instagram etc. It's popularity was evident too when I stopped by this outlet on a busy Saturday,  There were lots of folks admiring the different bags, wallets, tech accessories and jewelry.

The deals at this outlet store were good! They had different special offers! It was nice to see some of the newest styles offered at a discounted price as well. They even were offering MK lipstick at a special price (I didn't know MK had makeup! So cool!)

I did not buy the lipstick, but I did end up with a nice watch in a style I've never seen before. I was happy with my purchase and happy with this store. It's nice to find good deals and different, unique styles that are not easily found elsewhere.

Loved my stay! 

My aunt and my uncle have a timeshare, and the Hiltons on the strip were booked, so we ended up here at the one by the Convention Center. It was only about 5 minute drive to the strip, it was quiet and very comfortable. 

We were on the 11th floor in adjoining rooms and it was super comfy! One room had a full kitchen, big frig, dishwasher, dining table, washer and dryer, couches and TV, a separate bedroom and restroom. 
The other room, which i was in, had a huge, very comfortable soft bed, a tv, couch, table, dresser, closet, kitchenette with small fridge and a bathroom. Bathroom had a tub and nice oversized showerhead for shower. 

The only things that i would note that was negative was the doors inside the rooms got stuck. The bathroom door would not close correctly and would made a horrid loud sound every time you tried to get out. The middle door adjoining the rooms got stuck too. 

Other than that,  if you are staying for more than a weekend, this place is really clean and comfortable!

My favorite chocolate bar from Vosges now comes in dark chocolate!! Yes, you can now get Mo's Bacon Bar in dark chocolate... Applewood smoked bacon + Alder wood smoked salt + 62% dark chocolate. It's scrumptious! 

Vosges is for the adventurous chocolate lover, and definitely for the chocolate lover who isn't afraid to splurge on decadence. The chocolate bars are $7.50-$8.50, and individual truffles are $2.50. 

The staff was rather generous with giving us samples. I practically had a taste of every flavor. I think pretty much all of the exotic ones EXCEPT for the dark chocolate + mushrooms one. That one sounded like something you'd eat before seeing a Cirque show.

Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.

Five bucks.  A burger, fries and can of pop.  How can you go wrong?
I had the Guac burger.  It's the reason I took a star away.  The burger itself was great, but the guac?  Notsomuch.  They do have a good array of different toppings to choose from.  
The fries were shoestring-cut and had a spiced salt sprinkled on them.  It was a good-sized serving.  
I love a can of pop!  They have Shasta, which is two thumbs up for me.  It doesn't have NutraSweet in the diet, but Splenda.  Hooray!
Getting out of this place is a bitch so here's my secret: Go out the back way, through the car wash to get to 7th Street.  Traffic on Indian School, right at the 7th Street light, sucks moose balls.

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

Wow. Fail. Really. You just blew it.

I wasn't so concerned or rallied up about the organic aspect as I had my doubts to it's legitimacy. It was the pick up and drop off delivery service that made me get out the gay spray. 

Really. This potential customer, who recently lost a whole bunch of pounds and has a whooooole new wardrobe, is keeping his dry cleaning business at Society Cleaners on Camelback. Shout out...hey...arms in the air...

I called in and inquired about the delivery service. The employee took my address and times that would work for me for dropping off my dry cleaning bags. She also told me she wasn't sure about their schedule as the driver is in college and has different class times. 

What? Like I give a rat's ass if the driver is in college or in Depends. Don't. Care. But I was excited for this new luxury. 

Thursday comes. Three o'clock to five o'clock. Six. Six thirty. No show. Fail. I didn't bother calling back. 

Nor should you.

Alright Tao, you've redeemed yourself in my book! Unlike some other wannabe hotspots in Vegas (rhymes with Insanity), Tao gets it and treats the ladies right!

My girls and I bypassed the line and were led to a VIP table without any attitude. We also got hooked up with open bar for an hour. The bartenders were friendly and so were the rest of the staff.

We had a plush area to lounge in and a platform behind us to dance on top of. The dance floor filled up quick, so it was nice to have our own area to shake our booties. 

Music was 90's hip hop early on in the night, so we had a fun time before we left for XS.

Thanks for the awesome VIP treatment, guys!!

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

This is the single most annoying thing about lost wages... then again you can collect the escort playing cards and trade them with your friends...

Has anyone ever found or hired the girl from the card and gotten her autograph? Are the girls on the cards really in Vegas and working as an escort? Hmmmm... enquiring minds want to know. Has a businessman in vegas called for an escort and have his daughter appear at his hotel room unbeknownst to either of them? 

Well all these questions and more will likely never ever be answered. Haha

Pro Tip: Really? Like I would know... I have never hired one of these performers. So sorry, No Pro Tip's for you on this one hahaha

But yeah, these illegal alien types working for likely next to nothing, and the girls are likely working for tips... but hey it's the world's oldest profession and this is in Sin City...

Regardless of that, the trash generated by these folks is ridiculous... Literally you see these cards blowing down the boulevard morning noon and midnight... At least they could put a trash can near them to dump that stuff into...

Whoa, what an incredible... list of bourbon!  Well hello nurse.  I mean, such hard to find bourbon.  OMG, really, how do they do that??  Uhhhh. What???

A speak easy from the 1920's, and while sure, Vegas Strip'esque (you walk up to a seemingly innocent bar only to be escorted into a fantasy world of beautiful women), it serves up the best bourbons the States has to offer.

Angel's Envy, Elijah Craig 21, E.H. Taylor Small Batch, Pappy's 23yr old Grand Reserve (which they are currently out of).  It's all there for the taking if you're willing to pay.  And pay your will.  Very high  Vegas markups.

Minimum charge for a seat or table ($50 if you want to stand), but well, well, well worth it for the burlesque show.  Not too racy, very suggestive.  Good audience mix from guys to gals all having a good time.

A true hidden gem of a night spot and one deserving of a try for any bourbon enthusiast.

Wait, what were we talking about...

Caramel is strictly a LOUNGE. Don't let their booming top 40's music let you think of it as anything else.

This is a nice place to relax and mingle for people in their late 20's and older. Other patrons need not bother coming by.

As sophisticated as this place may look, it does boom loud hip-hop and pop beats, but the dominant vibe in this place is "sit down, talk, and sip." 

These two mixed messages made for a night of being too young, too drunk, and being the only people on the "dancefloor." Boo.

If you're looking to have a nice chat and a couple of cocktails with a date or small group of friends, this place is lovely. If you want to have a more dynamic, dance-filled experience, do not go here.

My family has a motto: "Pot just makes me tired and hungry; and I'm already tired and hungry." For some of the family this means "Say no to drugs"; for others it means harder stuff is where it's at; for me it means "I need a burger and a nap."

Cue the hippies. 

Two Hippies served me up a real burger. Like a REAL one! you know curvy like I like em; not flat. 

The fries came in a paper bag so that no one can claim they had no idea it was bad for them and sue. The bad is clear by the time you take a seat...grease may be my favourite food

I am not going to be the only one not to mention that you get a burger, fries and can of soda (pop for Thomas S and the people of his homeland and surrounding areas--ps they say pop because they would just say soda funny.) for $5!! Way better than fast food for cheaper. 

I will now end this review because I am tired...and hungry...

NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.

NO body.

Especially at restaurants.

So if you want to offer a ginger infused lychee martini.  And it tastes like the vodka that comes straight out of my freezer.  Well . . . 

It SUCKS.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen. 

And if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . . 

It's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.

But if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.  Vegas) . . .   that break-dances on your tastebuds and plays the drumline on your tonsils.   

Well . . . It gets it's ass sent to my dancing buddha belly.  Happy buddha belly.

5 Stars.  A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than made up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.

And about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.

So  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.  

(Okay!  So I had to wash his underwear for a month.  It's Vegas, baby.  Vegas)

Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.
They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. 
Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.
I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.

I got waxed!

And it was fantastic!

I've been having an inclination to head out to LA to visit Grauman's Chinese Theater & Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum for awhile now.  While in Vegas, we had time to kill so we decided to check out Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I used Tix4Tonight to purchase ticket vouchers for $18/piece, saving myself cash money, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas.  Here's the lowdown-

I had such a good time!  The resemblance of the wax figures to their real-life counterparts vary from spot-on to roughly vague.  Here, posing & touching are encouraged.  Check out my Yelp page for some of the pics I took.  Some I didn't post were a bit on the raunchy side (Fergie & Jenna Jameson, I apologize for my actions that day).  I'm not interested in Nascar/Indy Car racing, so that wing didn't appeal to me & I didn't check out the Scream Haunted House wing.  There was a plethora of wax figures, some w/ props that patrons can use when posing for the camera.  Celebs vary from Tony Bennett & Dean Martin to Katy Perry & 2pac.  Everyone of all ages should get a kick out of the celebs featured here.  There weren't too many people when I was there, so it felt like I had free run of the place, which I gleefully took advantage of.  

To reiterate, I had a blast visiting Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I look forward to visiting the LA location to see whom they have exhibited there.  I remember the old Hollywood Wax Museum that used to be open in Buena Park, and MT blows that out of the water.  I recommend everyone come by and check out Madame Tussaud's for themselves.  You won't regret it!

Good times!

Dollar Blackjack...Wah?! I'm there
The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

It's BRITNEY, B*TCH!!!!

Fabulous show!!!  Lights, theatrics, vivid sets, striking costumes, outrageous dance performances, smooth song transitions ... It was a very entertaining show!  Her songs alone will get you off your feet to dance, dance, dance ... So I didn't mind standing 95% of the 90-minute show.  You could sit but you wouldn't be able to see since everyone was standing and dancing, which makes for a high energy, fun show.

We all have heard it time and time again, she lip syncs her shows ... SO WHAT!!!  She's not Adele or any high caliber vocalist!!  I'm sure they're not jumping and flying all over the stage at their concerts, it's impossible to dance and sing perfectly!  So prerecorded?  I don't care!!  She's an awesome performer with beat-thrilling, ass-shaking songs!  

Btw: Sorry that douche cheated on you, Brit.  Good job dropping his @ss!!!  Demand to be cherished and nothing less!!!   You looked great, post popping out 2 kids!  Keep it up, girlie!!!

*This review is dedicated to Brandon C. for reviewing Brit's boutique http://www.yelp.com/biz/britney-spears-boutique-las-vegas?hrid=XPYdszVwVxkPiTZ2qqrLPA.  Now go watch the show!!!!  lol!

We dropped by here for an after dinner cafe.  I have been to Espressamente in Italy as well as here, and at the V.

I like the selection of cafes, sandwiches, crepes, macarons, desserts and gelato.  In addition, the Vegas locations are open until 1 am.  What I don't like are the prices.  A large cafe is $5, and it isn't that large.  Sandwiches are $10, crepes are $12, and the portions are not that large.

Nonetheless, you have to give Espressamente credit for its offerings which are quite extensive.  If there were one by my house, I would be a regular.  Plus, I love the color of the rainbow offerings w/ their gelato which I found to be very good on previous occasions.

Useless, overpriced GARBAGE!  

 I came in really wanting to buy something, but as I looked around the store and picked up the items, they looked very cheesy and poorly made for the amount of money they were charging.  Novelty items and ugly cheaply made clothing alike.  $100 for a clutch, and when I opened it, the magnetic clasp seemed flimsy and ready to fall off.  It was hilarious.   

But what can I expect,   trash in exchange for money -- that's who the Kardahsian's are anyway, right?? Lol. 

Another thing that I will have to concur with another reviewer.  I did notice that they were selective about who they gave their Kardashian shopping bags to.  If they don't like how you look or don't think you fit into who they're trying to market their store to by carrying their bags, then no Kardashian shopping bag for you, you get a Mirage bag.  They'll gladly take your money, but they don't want you associated with shopping at their store.

I say pass this store.  You'd find cuter, better quality items at the flea market.  And you won't be discriminated against and denied a shopping bag.

Since I'm in a Eugene O'Neill frame of mind, I'm going to title this review as "A Moon for the Misbegotten."

In my review of our return flight from BOS, initially on American and ultimately US Air to PHX, I called it: "A Long  Days Journey into Night."  That was due to the scheduling mishap and "equipment issues" experienced on that trip. We were moved from a connecting flight on American, to a non-stop on US Air

After arriving in PHX, our bags were somehow where misplaced.  The AA folks in BOS promised they would get word down stairs to the baggage handlers to move it over to US Air.  Well, we arrived on time, but with no bag in the carousel as you would say.

The nice thing about traveling today, as opposed to twenty years ago is all the technology the airlines use.  They were able to locate our bag, since it was scanned in our original connecting airport of DFW. Wow. But, they weren't sure where it was just now. Ugh.

They took all our information and promised they would find it and deliver it to our front door. Hmmm I thought, but they were very reassuring and sincere about it.  So yesterday around four o'clock our doorbell rang and yes, there was our bag.  Looking no worse for it's side trip to DFW.  

But now we have a mystery.  Why did our bag have a United Airlines tag, over the original American Airlines one?  Sometimes, life is about not asking too many questions! LOL

First off, I have to say I forgot how much I LOVE the fries at Houston's. Totally my fave in all of fry land. The burger was cooked MW as Rickie requested and come out MW. I'm more of a MR kinda guy, but even at MW, this burger did not disappoint. 

Service is really great. We all know that. It was less robotic than I remember and for that I was grateful. God, I hate those forced, learned corporate bullshit greetings! Ugh...folks here seemed to actually have their own personality! Wow. Thank you Stepford Houston's. Have you loosened that Bolo tie recently?

The crowd was uncanny for a Sunday afternoon. Rickie asked me if there was a hooker convention in town! Seriously. It was like a slut buffet parading around. 

Thanks Houston's. Good to know we can depend on you still.

Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:

"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. 
Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"

It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.

Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well, let me just say this; "Don't waste your money!" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!

Steve is fantastic! I generally consider myself a fairly self-sufficient homeowner. I can fix running toilets, drill holes and grease garage doors myself lol but my squeaky front door that had worsened and expanded during the rainy season was driving me nuts. The hinges were looking crazy and I knew I had to do something about it.
 
Of course I searched Yelp and I found Steve's business with excellent reviews. I called his number, left a voicemail and promptly received a friendly call back a few hours later. He was courteous, professional, timely and charged me a very reasonable rate.

I definitely recommend Steve and will absolutely call him when I need additional home repair done. Thanks Steve!

This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.

TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!

Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.

Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.
Neither was delivered on this visit.

I may or may not go there again

Psst...over here, pal. Youz like da slices do youz? Well, here's a little secret just between youz and me pal ... Down a non-descript hallway lined with album covers in the Cosmopolitan Hotel youz can find Secret Pizza. 

No matter how much you lose in Vegas, save $5 for some 5-star pizza. Shanon Y. was right about the White Sauce Cheese Pizza. It's a pizzagasm in your mouth of grease, cheese, and crust. 

There is only enough room for a few places to stand and eat at Secret Pizza ... Lots of families and groups were buying whole pies and chowing down in the hallways and lounge areas. It has no sign. It has no name, but the secret is out about Secret Pizza.

Had it not been for the Illuminations Half Marathon http://www.yelp.com/biz/illuminations-half-arizona-phoenix, I would have never known...never known that set amidst the majestic Sonoran Desert and surrounded by the beautiful McDowell Mountains--rows upon prickly rows of saguaro cacti maintaining their century-old vigils--sits JW Marriott's spectacular Desert Ridge Resort.

People golf here, it seems.  I mean, the Marriott shoulders two championship golf courses, ones designed in part by Arnold Palmer, and they look seriously cool...if you're a golfer.  I'm not.  In fact, I hate golfing.  Rather, I came here to run.  And these courses, illuminated for the Half Marathon with hundreds and hundreds of glowsticks, were great fun nonetheless--beautiful, even after sundown.

The amenities at the Marriott--lazy river, heated pools, spa, fitness center, tennis courts (to name a few)--were impressive.  And although I hadn't the time to explore them--my stay was short--I took notice, traveling about the resort, snapping a few shots.  Next time--and I'm sure there'll be a next time--I'll give them a try.  What was nice, though, was simply waking early, grabbing a Peppermint Mocha from the in-house Starbucks, and sitting outside, fire pit cozy.  I love mornings!  And in Phoenix, it seems, some golfers enjoy mornings too.

This is the perfect place to wander into after a long night, and all you want is a greasy pizza with the 1 dollar bills you have left in your pocket you purposely created from your $5.00 so you can play more penny slots. Instead of being left with those .16 cents ticket redemption stubs you can't even play, save those dollars to be spent in the rabbit hole- with no directory name or signs, the fun part is trying to find this place!
But i'm not going to spoil your fun by telling you where this place is- but will give u one clue. If u see a pool table, you're warm. So warm, you will be burning the roof of your mouth in 5 minutes biting into that hot cheese. You've been warned.

Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?

Pizza A Metro in CenPho is branching out! For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.

I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites -- 

The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.

Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.

Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.

For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!

East-siders, mark your calenders and get ready for Amarone!

Are you kidding me?  Seriously.

If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.

We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.

Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.

This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  

And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.

We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  

Seriously.

You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes "Sydney After Dark", but also current strip shows like "Fantasy", "X Burlesque" and "Crazy Girls".  

Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    

Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the "lahnn daahn undah" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of "Locomotion" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. 

The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend "Fantasy" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!

Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.

This is your typical Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen gas station location, but serving up some decent chicken. 

There isn't a great many free standing Popeye's locations here in the Valley, while it's former corporate sister Church's, seem to have nothing but free standing places. 

I have a friend who use to own two franchises in the Midwest back in the day. He and everyone who ever met Popeye's founder, Al Copeland thought the world of him. Copeland had this NOLA style, Horatio Alger story. Rags to riches, back to rags... well, not quite.  But in the end, Copland had enough to leave a bunch of money to LSU.  Not bad for a high school dropout.

The secret, as most Popeye aficionados will tell you, is to come here when they are running special. Like Tuesdays, when the special is 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and a drink for $3.99. Otherwise, it can be just as expensive as the Colonels' place. But Popeye's chicken is better!  

Oh, how I miss the MSG laced Cajun Sparkle.  It was better than coffee. LOL. Three Stars, A-Okay.

Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.

Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.

We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!

So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!

With the wide array of Asian fare available in Las Vegas beyond the strip, Japanese cuisine continues to lead the pack in terms of variety and innovation.  With heavy emphasis on presentation in Japanese dishes(often to create the illusion of more with less), they inevitably begin to resemble works of art.  If Japanese small plates in Las Vegas were to be represented by famous artists I would label them as the following:

Raku= Picasso- the old master, consistently brilliant and timeless with indisputable genius and imagination

Kyara= Cezanne- transition between the traditionalists and the modernists pulling in influences from various sources 

Ichiza= Warhol- iconic and often overhyped/controversial in public opinion

With Yonaka, Rene Magritte comes to mind:
-Magritte is from Belgium (the signature appetizer is the crispy "Brussels" sprouts with puffed rice, coincidence?)

-Often overlooked and underrated (much like Yonaka's location off the strip in an unassuming retail center on Flamingo and Decatur) 

-Challenges convention while giving new meaning to the familiar (compressed watermelon with house made fish sauce and thai basil? But of course!)

-Much like his most famous work "The Son of Man" (http://uploads2.wikipaintings.org/images/rene-magritte/son-of-man-1964(1).jpg) there is  frequent juxtaposition of fruit in unexpected settings at Yonaka, like the dynamite combination of orange supremes with salmon and tobiko or the tender cuts of wagyu served with peach salsa and slices of georgia peach, which all work in surrealistic harmony.

-Pierce's Brosnan's title character in "The Thomas Crown Affair" takes inspiration from Magritte's "Son of Man" to pull off a seemingly impossible art heist at the climactic conclusion, and the happy hour menu offered at 5-630PM and 11-2AM offer food and libations at such low prices/great value, your bill will seem like the steal of the century.

Perfect for a first date, gathering of friends, or an intro to the local scene for an out-of-town visitor, Yonaka is modern Asian cuisine executed to perfection, and the food does in fact tastes as good if not better than it looks.

This Crate & Barrel is one of their two level versions, with a large display of furniture upstairs. It also is a nice compliment to the Pottery Barn across in Scottsdale Quarter. 

Since I work nearby, we're always stopping here to browse after a Starbucks run. The staff is incredibly nice and very helpful. They will go out of their way to order, or call another store to find any out of stock item for you.

Then of course is their world class wrapping.  I know this might seem trivial compared with the high end retailers found in Kierland, but it is especially true for Crate & Barrel. Nothing has ever broken in a bag they pack, no matter how fragile.  

A very nice shopping experience. Enjoy!

Really gays? What has happened to us? We've become so serious. So mainstream. So. Oh dear. How do I say this...so, so heterosexual! GASP! 

Strollers. Parents. Pets. Lacoste shirts. Topsiders. Soccer moms. Soccer dads. And in my best Sarah Palin voice, "Joe 6 packs". Just normal folks don't ya know. You betcha. 

Where are the inappropriately dressed men in Speedos, glitter and nipple tassels? Dykes on bikes? Minors tripping on E? What has happened to our luster people? Have we become....um, boring? 

Well, I"m not sure. But the Rainbows Festival is darn fun. A small town feel, in a lovely urban setting, filled with the usual food vendors, t-shirts booths and local organizations hawking their wares and services. But overall, the genuine feeling of fun, love and celebration permeated this event. 

Lots of smiles, hugs and waves. And yes, lots of families of all types. And, really, that is what it's all about right. We noshed on turkey legs, tacos and swilled Bud and fruity vodka drinks. Ten bucks to park, but free to get in. How cute and small town is that? Well, not the parking maybe. But who doesn't love a free party? 

Rickie and I had a blast and at the end of our Rainbow, we found a bag full of condoms, lube and free minutes for a gay sex site. Ahhh, my people! Girls and gays just wanna have fun! See ya next year. And don't forget the nipple clamps!

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

A weekly gathering of Charlotte's finest food on wheels in Historic South End? Hell yes. Every Friday, at the corner of Camden and Park Ave, you'll find 10, or so, of Crown Town's local food trucks doling out the best street food our fair city has to offer. 

You're most likely to find the likes of:

Turkey And...
Papi Queso
Tin Kitchen
Cupcake Delirium
Southern Cake Queen
Herban Legend
Auto Burger
Sticks and Cones

and plenty others join the ranks on the regular. 

Parking is a disaster. Plain and simple. You're better off finding a parking space somewhere off of South, a nearby garage, or even going further down Camden or finding a space at Atherton. If the weather's nice, make a nice of walk of it. 

I'd recommend bringing some easy-to-carry chairs, a blanket, and a cooler of beers/water. Some of the trucks sell drinks (Papi Queso usually has a nice assortment) but some tend to not carry any. Common Market is an easy choice for a beverage, but get ready to stand in a long line if it's a busy FFF. 

I agree with Jeff S -- Check it out sometime!

What can I say about Surrender. One of the worst club I have been to. The setting of the club sucks. Small dance floor I mean small. One bar in the back of the club. That has only 3 or 4 bartender try to make drinks for hundreds of people. Imagine the wait. The other bar was in the front near the Dj where it was blocked off for I don't know what. The service was horrible.
On the other hand I would like thank Dilpo you killed it!!! Great set!

Got tickets from Tix4tonight for tickets on the same day of the show... they seat you based on 1st come 1st served unless you upgraded & paid more $$ to be in the VIP sections.

Had so much fun here, the show is kinda cheesy but it's all clean fun with HOT HOT guys! =)

The guys here are HOT HOT HOT!! =) +1

I like the way the stage is setup here..not only is it the front stage but there's a part of the stage where they can walk out into the audience more. +1

The guys interacted with the audience a LOT LOT more than at Chippendale. +1

If you want to sit closer to the stage or in the middle of the seating area, you have to pay more for those seats. =(

The main guys knew how to dance but the ones at the end of the line were just there for eye candy; that's just fine with me.. =) +1

Great for bachelorette parties/ just girlie get togethers =)

A Geno's cheese steak.  A pastrami from Katz Deli.  A French dip from Philippe's.  A brisket and tongue from Carnegie Deli.  A godmother from Bay Cities Italian Deli.  A "Fluff and Nutt" from the Goodwich.  

Unfair compression?  If you're going to charge me $3.00 for something I can make at home for $0.50 or claim to serve foie de pate for only $9.00 you better be able to compete with the big boys.

A great concept, chef inspired twist on the classics but in the end, these are greasy, unhealthy, bizarre sandwiches.

- PBB&J (peanut butter, bacon, pepper jelly and rosemary).  Bizarre but it works.  Peanut butter and bacon, a match made in heaven is complemented by the herbaceous aroma of the rosemary.

- "Ruben-ish" (corned beef, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, fennel kraut) A paltry amount of somewhat dry, corned beef that initially pairs well with the anise flavor of the kraut.  The kraut quickly becomes overpowering with each bite.

- "Foie &" (Foie pate, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds)  Chicken skin is excellent while the sauted cabbage adds vegetal sweetness and almonds, crunch.  I doubt their claim that they are using pate de foie gras.  French law mandates the pate be made of 80 percent foie.  The mouth feel is off and the mineral flavor leads me to think this is chicken liver pate.

Supermarket quality white, wheat or rye breads.  All becoming dry from toasting.  Making them "Monte Cristo" (a dip in egg before being griddled) just makes them more greasy and less appetizing.

Excessive Yelp hype aside, in the end, just an average sandwich.

Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. 

I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)

The Cycle Pub Crawl took us here as one of the stops but we wish they hadn't. For a chain restaurant, their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub, but not a crappy chain restaurant.
We all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave.
A very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby.

You want some bread to go with that cheese?

I'm immediately reminded of Chuck E.  Cheese, The Country Bears etc.

Cheap animatronics with some fire & water thrown in for spectacle, Fall of Atlantis is a free attraction located in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace.  King Atlas has to decide upon who his replacement should be to the  throne, his daughter who has special water effects, or his son who contributes the pyrotechnics.  Gods itervene & have some choice words for King Atlas & his offspring.  The climax brings about a dragon who lays the smackdown on all the Atlanteans & lays waste to Atlantis
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/caesars-atlantis-fountain/

I know it's free, but I feel like the Fall of Atlantis cheapens the "baller" atmosphere of Caesar's Forum Shops.  I mean, with Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton and Ferragamo attracting the rich clientele, you'd think there would be something more worthy of the demographic?  To me, the best part of the Fall of Atlantis is the large aquarium, with rays, puffers and other assorted marine creatures.  Of course, I grew up on Jacques Cousteau, so I'll always be partial to the sea ;p

Fall of Atlantis shows at the top of the hour, every hour, starting at 11am.  

I suppose if you were slurring your speech & crap-faced drunk, this show would be more entertaining.  All in all, I say let the tourists watch this lame spectacle of out-dated robotics & head over to something more worthy of your time, like the Bellagio fountains or one of the buffets.

Love the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. This location is much smaller than the one at Aria, but has a constant line for a reason: the pastries, desserts, crepes, coffees, and chocolates are divine.

Hordes of people crowd around to take pictures of the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (according to the strange folks at Guiness), but I was more mesmerized by the fresh crepes, croissants, and cupcakes. We enjoyed a late breakfast 2 days in a row featuring pastries from Jean Philippe and wish we had stayed at the Bellagio longer just to have more.

 * Palmier - Flaky, crisp cookie covered with caramelized sugar 5/5
 * Croissant - Light and airy with a butter flavor to melt in your mouth 4/5
 * Almond Croissant - Filling Crme D'amandes; sprinkled with sugar & almonds 5/5
 * Chocolate Croissant - Jean Philippe chocolate + croissant = yum 3.5/5
 * Blueberry Brioche - Surprisingly addictive slice of bread with blueberries 3/5
 * Blueberry Danish - Light shell and heavy fruit jam heaven 4/5
 * Latte - Pick me up of espresso & steamed milk to start the day 4/5
 * White Cafe Mocha - Sweet mocha (espresso & chocolate) with White Chocolate 5/5

There are two locations and both on Yelp list Aria as the address when in fact the one with the chocolate fountain is in the Bellagio.

Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio was perfect.

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

Guy Savoy was impressive, very impressive.  I have not even eaten here, but it does not really matter.  Guy Savoy is hospitality personified.  I came here for one reason, Krug.  I had called to see if a reservation was required to have some bubbly at the Bubble Bar (where they poured Krug by the glass) and was told that it was not necessary and that they look forward to having us.  When we arrived, we were told that the Bubble Bar was sold out for the evening.  The hostess was quite gracious and apologetic when I told her about the phone conversation I had regarding reservations.  She suggested we talk to the manager and then guided us to the restaurant.  

I approached the manager who was at the front desk, informed him of the situation and without hesitation, he led us to their private patio. It was beautiful and romantic. The manager served us personally. He brought us two glasses of Krug and surprised us with three canapes.  They were delicious.  

This is the mark of a great restaurant.  We were in Vegas, we wanted an experience at Guy Savoy, and without hesitation or pretense, they gave me exactly what I wanted and more. 

I will be back in a month or so to have dinner, I cannot wait.

Ichiza was shut down by the SNHD on June 30. 
http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php

Ugh. If you like to play Russian Roulette with your health, keep reading. But personally, I'd never come here again, because they don't practice basic hygiene yet they serve raw fish and raw beef. Yuck. 

The food was decent, 4 stars. It reminds me of a smaller, dirtier Honda-ya in Tustin.  They've got typical Izakaya-style items on their menu, such as sashimi, yakitori and ramen. I really enjoyed the kimchi buta and the famous honey toast. I also got the beef tataki, which was decent, but now I feel queasy that I ate it. . 

The decor isn't much. It feels like an authentic Japanese Izakaya; small, cramped, with a decent sake list and faded pieces of paper taped to the wall. 

Service was ok, it wasn't packed on a Thurs. night when we went. 

Decent place, but with the health concerns and so many other good places to eat nearby, I doubt I'll ever go back here again.

We had dinner here last night with some friends and I'm raising my rating by one star to three. 

Everything I wrote about in my original review is still present and I agree with the Yelp'er who thought Nick's as over rated at best. 

The wine list is sad, with only three choices of Italian reds, all Chanti. No Barolo's, Valpolicella, Sangiovese's, or any super Tuscans. I do realize that chantii is made mostly from the sangiovese varietal, but a simple sangiovese would have been nice. 

Where Nick's has improved in is their fish offerings and the baked Lasagna. Both were very good. But their meat Lasagna, which is made with a flavorful Bolognese sauce, was delicious and worth a trip.

Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, you are simply heavenly! I LOVED my visit to St. Francis. Just like I loved the first year of Charlie's Angels when Farrah was on. Just like I loved Chachi and not Joanie. Just like I love smooth and not chunky. I was honored to have a tour of St. Francis by Mr. Aaron Chamberlain himself. He pointed out the architectural details and history of his career. Right down to family serving spoons used in his grandparents restaurant embedded in to the brick near the front door. The sleek, glass garage door which opens up to Camelback. If you're sitting outside you have a panoramic view of the interior and if you're inside you get a bird's eye view of the street scape. 

The second story (which is in limbo and awaiting a mural and a more defined purpose) is structurally held in place by a "V" shaped collection of steel rods...unfreakinreal! The birch floors on the stairs, the gravel on the patio, the maple beams, the seemless glass front table...I'm having an interior design orgasm! 

Oh. The food? Yep! Yummers! Thin crust pizzas with a airy, pillow crust...tried an arrugula za and had one with figs! The signature salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing (DON'T THINK RANCH!)...it's so much more and the goat cheese brulee made my mouth, my tummy and my soul very happy! You can feel the love from the kitchen as well as an attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.

You're like my foodie angel, arriving in CenPho to save fme rom Applebee's and Sweet Tomatoes! I say Halo St. Francis. Halo and welcome to the hood!

Miss Sixty offers up unique takes on denim and other casual ware - with their sassy cuts.

Though their stuff is pricey, and you may have to endure trying on a good number of different sizes, since many of their jeans have strange cuts and are made from varied material - you can get a personal guarantee that once you find the right Miss Sixty piece - you will want sixty more of them.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the current Miss Sixty collection is that they're fashion forward and are bringing back overalls. They've added stretch to them, made them short and bootylicious, and injected some 'tude into them. Mark, the guy helping us at this specific Miss Sixty was extremely personable, helpful, and outgoing. He went out of his way to check in with each of us to see if we were interested in trying stuff on, and recommended that we check out the Miss Sixty outlet nearby, and extended his family and friends discount to us.

Unfortunately the cute pair of booty-alls that I tried on, were far too expensive for me and due to length, I could probably only wear them in Vegas, but it's reassuring to know, as an overalls collector - that there's a fashion line just as excited about straps attached to pants as I am.

Hi. My name is Drew and I have lactose intolerance. Why should you care? Bc I NEVER eat ice cream or gelato... besides AOF. Given, the above statement means I don't have much experience judging gelato, I still think it means a lot that I roll the dice to eat the lovely creamy goodness from AOF. 

From my first time here, a blind tasting, to subsequent visits ordering specialties like cinnamon toast crunch and blueberry pancake, I always leave wanting more. The price is right. The owners are on hand and friendly. What else can you ask for? Then again, I can see how it can be hit or miss, bc your fave flavor from last time might not be there on your next visit, but I've always found a nice substitute. Do it.

We came here last evening to listen to that great voice which is Mandy Patinkin. Wow it was even better than we could have imagined.

His vocal range is incredible. He started with some old old Broadway tunes from the 40s and 50s. Then moves on and starts softly speaking these words without music:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

So you say to yourself. No!  He's not going to sing it. And, he doesn't. He just leads into the middle of another old Broadway tune. So you think, what was that?  Well, it was a tease. 

He starts having a dialogue with the audience about his marriage and wife.  But then comes back to it. Now accompanied by Paul Ford on the piano. He sings the entire song. Bohemian Rhapsody. All the parts. Wow! Freddie Mercury would have been proud!

That's how the evening went. Interspacing old show tunes with some more recent melodies.  He sang a few from Steven Sondheim's "Sundays in the Park with George".  It was a show he was nominated for a Tony.  The best of the night, was his singing of Oh Shenandoah. What made it special was his stopping midway to recite the first part of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. He goes back to Oh Shenandoah, then finishes the second half of Gettysburg Address and the last verse of Oh Shenandoah. Absolutely beautiful.

Surprisingly no tunes from Evita. A show he won the Tony for his role of Che, and made famous with Patti Lepone.  He finished the evening with a tune from the movie Ragtime and the music of Randy Newman. 

There were two curtain calls. He and his pianist Paul Ford looked exhausted after a non-stop ninety minutes. We left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. This was our first time to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and we were very impressed.

REVIEW # 100 !!! 
Blue Man Group, at the Venetian Hotel in Vegas, was entertaining, educational and musical all the same time. I had the pleasure of attending Blue Man with my entire extended family and I have to say- I think this was the best situation to see the show.  

The show was interactive and even slightly captivating at times. Audience members are escorted to the stage to participate and the members of the show walk through the aisles, and sometimes even climb over the seats.  You can't get much more interactive than that.  

There are two shows, one at 7 pm and one immediately after it at 9pm.  I dont know how those guys do it, they have to clean the entire theatre after having just trashed it.  

I have to say- I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more paint involved.  It seemed more of a comedy/music show that I thought.  So much emphasis had been put on the pipes and paint, but very little time was actually dedicated to them.

Would I see it again?  You know, I think Blue Man Group is a treat to see once but seeing as the show hasn't changed at all since it opened, it will almost positively be the same if you went back again.

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Last night I learned that I should have applied myself to ice skating at a young age. I am a naturally graceful and beautiful figure skater. I skated backwards, I did twirls and even executed a highly skilled jump, and I have not even been on a pair of skates for sixteen years.

The pro shop did not have gloves, but quickly after getting on the ice I realized that I wouldn't need them because I was going to spend my time upright versus laying on the ice like I had anticipating before realizing how highly skilled of a skater I am. 

$8.25 (I think) paid my admission for two hours of skating and got me some sweet rental skates. I really wanted some graceful white ones, but I got brown. Fortunately I had leg warmers to complete my ensemble and tie everything together. Brown has never looked so good with sparkly gray tights before. 

There were plenty of places to pop a squat to put on your skates or take a break and they have lockers to stash your shoes and hand bags. It also appears they have a snack bar and vending machines, but I did not partake in any of those offerings. 

I did, however, partake in some libations at the Ice House, located at the east end of the rink. I love that my friends and acquaintances sat inside the bar sipping their bourbon watching us skaters from the comfort of their warm seats. I'm certain they were too intimidated by my amazing skating skills to join on the ice.

If you thought THAT was impressive, just you wait... I am going to take lessons and next time we have an ice skating #pfn I will blow all of you away with my triple quadruple axle spin jumps.

Hawaiian cookie goodness.
Walking through the Venetian Shoppes, I saw Hawaiian Cookies. I remembered one of my Yelp friend Joe P mentioned this place as one of the best cookies he's had. The problem, it was in Hawaii. Lol. Not any more. This is the only location outside of the islands. They have the cookies shipped here from Hawaii. 

The place is small but it has that Aloha spirit. I was invited to taste some of their cookies. They have a self serve sample area. About 10 different cookies to try. Yes, I tried them all. Lol. 

Best Shortbread Cookies!!
My Favorites:
Coconut
White Chocolate Kona Coffee
Mango Macadamia
Lilikoi Mango
Ginger

You can get a gift pack of varying sizes or you can get a custom pack with 5, 10 or 20 cookies. 

I got a gift box for the Wifey and I got a custom 5 pack for my trip home. 

It's a bit pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. 
Service was super friendly, the Aloha spirit is alive here. 

The Hawaiian flavor makes these cookies stand out from the competition. I'm glad I got to try some without flying to the Islands. Lol. 

Try them out for yourself and decide.

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

Salmon Craving Satisfied in Vegas - Who'da Thought!

SITREP

I found myself hitting the Happy Hour here at Red Square (located at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino) and it did not disappoint.  

THE SETUP

My sweet dance partner and I were jone'sin for some munchies before we hit a dance competition event, but there was not going to be any food there.

Interestingly enough, we had just talked about our uncles - how they both hail from Idaho - and hers is sportsman who catches Salmon from the Snake River.  So as we arrived into Red Square, two (2) menu items just JUMPED OUT at us, like 2 Chinooks, and so we "jumped on them", so to speak.

LE MENU

The items had Salmon on them!  So for us, this was meant to be:

(1)  I saw the Siberian Nachos, which consisted of Salmon, Crispy Potato Gautrette, Sour Cream, and Caviar, believe it not.  Absolutely delicious, and probably the most singularly different nachos I've ever had; and then,

(2)  We were BOTH intrigued by the Smoked Salmon Pizza, which consisted of generous strips of smoked salmon & pickled red onions.  [The flavor of the pickled red onions  was a bit much for Cassandra, but we resolved that issue by picking them off.]

THE LOWDOWN

Definitely plan on coming back to Red Square again when I hit Vegas again.

An AYCE sushi restaurant for those who don't like sushi.  Jjanga is about sushi drowned (literally sitting in a puddle)  with sauces that mask  the taste of the seafood.

Typical AYCE quality; previously frozen, gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality, sticky, seasoned, over compacted short grain rice.  

The nigiri rundown:  Maguro, hamachi, and salmon previously frozen, tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking), the amaebi previously frozen, sticky, ammoniated taste, beef tataki tough, tamago over cooked.

Appetizers are in line with other AYCE joints.  Bought in gyoza and shumai, mayo coated baked mussels, overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers, OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce, chewy steak, overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel, and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise, heavily coated and fried crisp).

Vegas style rolls are a disaster.  The "dragon roll" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet, sticky, soy concoction) and the "Jack Pot Special" (Oily shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab, shrimp avocado, tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more.

Fun ambiance.  Fast service at the sushi bar.  $20.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner.  There is a time limit for ordering.  It was not enforced on two visits.

Falling below the pack of AYCE options in Vegas but an option if quantity is all that matters.

All I kept thinking about when I stepped into Zia Records was, like Wow... they've taken a 60's head shop and mixed it with a record store and POOF!  "Let's Do The Time Warp Again!"

The Zia chain is a used Record/ CD/ DVD/ Book/ Speaker shop that has incense burning to set the mood. I would imagine, though I didn't ask, that you could purchase rolling paper here too. So I began to wonder where are they hiding Bill and Ted as I walked around the store?  LOL

Don't get me wrong, I really like the concept and the prices seemed pretty good. If I was going off to college again, besides IKEA this would definitely make my list. This is a Geeks, Geek place. 

They have dorm posters and lots of cool toys from TV's past and present.  Everything from the robot from "Lost in Space"(photos), to a fairly large statues of Leonard Nimoy's Spock, both Matt Smith's and David Tennant's "Dr Who, as well as bendable toy figures from CBS's "Big Bang Theory". And yes, they have both Penny and Leonard. But let's not go there okay! LOL

So yes, I'm a Fan of Zia Records, and yes I'll be back. Now where did I leave my Tardis?  Beam me up Scott D!

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

I was staying with a bff for the week and on my last night in Vegas, we decided to go bar hopping downtown. He lived in N Las Vegas so we decided to get a room and not risk getting a DUI. I booked a last minute deal through a phone app and scored a room for pretty cheap.

The room was clean and modern-ish, but was the size of a walk-in closet!! A Kid Rock concert was happening right on Fremont and we happen to get a room on that side. It didn't matter since we weren't gonna be in the room anyways. If you old folks need sleep, don't stay here!

For my 800th review I chose my alma mater, UNLV.  It's been a while since I've graduated from this University.  However, I've had many interns from the school work for me and have hired many graduates over the years.  I also attend a lot of events at the school and remain very close with Alumni.  Here's my breakdown of the school:

PROS

- It's very cheap.  Even though tuition is going up, it's still less than many other State schools.

- Much of the campus has new buildings.  When I go on campus now, it feels like a strange place and I get lost all of the time because its 3x larger than it was when I attended.

- Great professors.  I can only speak about the College of Hotel Administration and the Business School.....the professors were awesome.  I learned so much from them.  Learning is a 2 way street, it's up to you to get as much out of it as you can.  It's not on the professors to make the class how you like it, you have to adjust to their teaching style and learn as much as possible.  To this day I remain in contact with many former professors.

- Nice campus.  By Vegas standards there's a lot of greenery around campus, which is a refreshing change of scenery.

- Library.  One of the best libraries in town is located on the UNLV campus.

- Basketball team.  The UNLV Runnin' Rebels have always been the favorite team in the city.  We've had some good years recently.  Hopefully we'll continue to build upon it and improve as time goes on.

CONS

- Minuscule Endowment Fund.  One of the main reasons UNLV is having a difficult time surviving in this economy is not only because of state cutbacks but also because the endowment is very tiny.  The school needs more support from the private sector.

- Visitor parking.  Student parking has improved dramatically since the time I was a student.....however, visitor parking is a nightmare.  I dread parking every time I go on campus.

Overall, I have fond memories of UNLV.  My experience here has helped me with my career and I've established many lifelong friendships over the years.  I would be proud to send my Son to this school.

Return Factor - 100%

Never in my Yelp career have I started, saved, deleted and restarted a review more than I have this Bashas review. One would think "This is just a grocery store, why all the trouble?"

Bashas is more than just a grocery store; it is a facilitator. A facilitator of what we need as consumers to fuel our lives and contribute to our happy memories or to help us wash away the bad ones. 

Bashas facilitated the best Champagne Sunday that ever existed. It has provided the chlorine that I so desperately needed so many times to keep my pool from going green. Here I found the curry paste that started my affinity for cooking. The cake that ended up all over my living room at my sister's 21st birthday? That's right: Bashas.

So many events and critical moments in our lives revolve around the tangible items we spend our hard earned cash on and we don't even realize it. We may complain about how long we have to stand in line or the fact that Bashas may be a tad more expensive than some other grocery stores, but we cannot deny that we need this Bashas. 

I need you, Bashas.

Never, ever, ever again. Ever. 

Because even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that. 

And just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit. 

So, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.

PS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by.

At the risk of sounding like an ad for an Adam Sandler movie where they interview audiences outside of the theater, I have to say that my face hurt from laughing so much after this show. I'm not what you'd call "easily offended." I'm a pretty thick-skinned gal and I'm not averse to foul language or nudity, but wow, I was even surprised by the amazingly offensive hilarity at this show. 

You know how most cirque-type shows have the acrobat act followed by the clown act. And the clown act is some foofy French shit that is mildly humorous at best, and mostly evokes an, "Aww, that's cute." Well, the "clown" act in Absinthe is totally different. The hosts are absolutely hilarious, and while I know a lot of it is scripted, they are on point with their improv too. 

The acrobat acts were 80% fantastic too, there was one that was whatevs, but just wait for the tightrope walkers. Thanks to the super intimate venue, you get to see tightrope walkers closer than you ever have before. It's pretty spectacular. 

Absinthe is my number one recommendation for Vegas these days. I'm not much into clubs, and I'd be more into shows if they didn't all run more per ticket than my car payment. But Absinthe, oh Absinthe. It's a must-see. And for the price (especially with the plentiful discounts around town), it can't be beat.

PS It's true. Be careful about sitting in the front row, you will more than definitely get teased. It's pretty hilarious, but if you're still recovering from Little Tommy teasing you in 4th grade for having hairy legs, well, maybe sit a few rows back.

SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

NEVER AGAIN.

I volunteered with a group from yelp to help with the "backpack for kids" program. Bins were organized along 2 sides and ready for us to gladly tackle it! We put on our handy dandy yelp finger-less gloves (thanks Drew!), grabbed a plastic bag, went down the line putting the amount posted on each food/drink bin in the bag and repeated the process until we were finished. It only took a couple of hours and together we packed over 3,200 bags! It's such a shame any child is hungry, but thank heavens for this program! These will go to children who might have nothing to eat over the weekend or when they are not at school. I had obviously heard of Three Square before, but I had no idea about this program as well the other volunteer opportunities available. I'm happy to have helped knowing how many kids were given meals and plan on volunteering here again! You should too! 

Check the calender on their website or call for upcoming opportunities that you can get involved in!

Craft cocktails at the Linq!

Blvd. Cocktail Company is the latest pre-prohibition style offering from the folks behind Commonwealth, Park on Fremont, etc..  Blvd is at home in its touristy Linq setting and is probably the best option in this Linq area for quality, craft cocktails.  The bar is tended by a combination of stellar mixologists and adequate bartenders...be sure to order from the stellar mixologists (choose wisely, one of the best in town is here) if you are going off-menu in the craft direction though.

A hipster design firm vomited all over this space and as a result, the setting is hip and trendy with POF wallpaper and paintings, while a giant light bulb chandelier dominates the center of the room.  Live music is cranked out of far too many speakers at an exceedingly high volume entirely mitigating your ability to enjoy conversation...but the music does seems to be on point as far as quality goes.  There was a fantastic artist playing the Saturday night we came down and I heard great things about the previous weekend as well.

It is a challenge for me to rate Blvd.  I would give out 3 stars for the tourist trap setting of the Linq.  It would be 2 if based on the volume of music....Maybe as high as 4 stars if judging simply on  the interior and theme of the bar.  But an easy 5 stars for the drinks from Juyoung.  You can do the math, that's a 3.5 Star average...it could go either way, but I'm going with a weak 4 Stars.

One of our routines after a movie, is to come here for a "le petit dessert".

It also works before the movie as well.  LOL.  It all depends if we're doing Reverse HH next door at Pita Jungle.

There are a few G Spots in Scottsdale.  This one serves just gelato, or frozen milk as I like to think of it.  The one in Old Town has some great pizza.  

Several Yelp'er it seems, have used up their allotment of the word "Amazing' to describe the G Spot.  So I'll add delicious to the lexicon.  We had the Dark Chocolate and Salty Caramel last weekend, after seeing Zero Dark Thirty.

Go!  Enjoy!

One sentence... IT'S WORTH THE MONEY. Lifetime fitness is truly a way of life, not just a gym. With three stories of endless equipment, classes, and a rock climbing wall you will find everything you need here. 

My boyfriend and I recently joined and have spent a vast majority of our free time using all lifetime has to offer. With two pools (one inside and one outside) a health cafe, various fitness classes (i live to practice yoga) and numerous machines it's very easy to spend the day here. 

I recently have been using the steam room as well. It's infused with eucalyptus... Need I say more?

My personal trainer Emily has been amazing as well. I'm really enjoying our sessions and the results.

I highly recommend this place to anyone. The price of $144 a month is a little steep for some but making that commitment make me want to work out even harder. 

If you're looking for a gym in the summerlin area this place is worth a trial.

Earl of Sandwich serves $6 sandwiches 24 hours a day. The problem is that the one and only sandwich I tried was extremely disappointing. I asked the lady at the counter for the most popular sandwich and she said, "Get the Earl Club." So, I did.

Sadly, the strongest flavor for the Club was Charcoal because the crust of the Bread was burned just enough to make it snap-hard and bitter while the Bacon was 2 strips of even crunchier charcoal crisps. With skimpy toppings, light on the cheese, and not enough flavor to overcome the burnt taste, the Earl Club was a miss. I ate most of the Turkey and Cheese, but let the rest hit the trash can on the way out.

The convenience of being connected to the Planet Hollywood Casino and Miracle Mile of Shops was nice, but the Earl of Sandwich was a losing bet in a city full of great eats. Treat it as a late night stomach-stuffer for $6. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. 

We decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent.

I mean.. whats there to say that hasnt been said already... This review is based solely on the SLS casino, not the restaurants or shops. 

We pulled up to Valet and we were told it was for hotel guests only. but they let us valet anyways. which was nice. As soon as you walk in you are hit with the dingiest smells of all smells. stale smoke. I am not a fan of the cigarette but it is what it is. We were completely underwhelmed by it all. The "cool factor" felt forced. Almost like a 50 year old woman wearing purple eye shadow and dressed head to toe in some gaudy animal print. Bad vibes all around. I seriously couldn't leave my boyfriend for 5 minutes to use the restroom without 3 hookers approaching him. I mean seriously, the infestation of hookers alone will keep us away from this place.

We were insanely underwhelmed. And its really too bad with places like Bazzar Meats, Fred Seigle, and Life nightclub, I wish they would have gone to different venues. We will be back for those places alone. But as for the SLS... good luck on not going bankrupt your first year.

Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Flour. (BSEF) That's all you need to bake your basic cupcake.

But what if you're flying from SFO to LAS to visit your peeps, and you not only don't have any B,S,E or F, you have no time? You call The Cupcakery for a quickie delivery of some of the finest cupcakes east of the Cali border!

While cupcake delivery is a big, pricey splurge (almost $70 for a dozen... half of which is delivery charge), it' well-worth seeing the look of "Ohhh, man that's one good yummy piece of cake" on everyones face as they take a bite of these moist-caked & creamy-topped gems. I was impressed!

Plus, cupcakes are a delightful alternative to flowers, don't you think?

For the record, the Red Velvet was really good, and while it's usually my favorite, I really loved the Vanilla, too!  

It's nice to know the greater Vegas area has a place like the Cupcakery handy... especially since it's so close to my peeps!

This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B.

I'm the Duke so I'm not not a fan. 

Pros: 
-It's just $10 a month and serves its purposes. $20 if you desire massage and tanning machine privileges and other things that $10 more gets you.
-No commitment. You pay monthly and cancel anytime.
-Lots of cardio machines which include treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairs, etc. I'm guessing at least 40 machines for cardio so you're not really waiting to go running or walking.
-Clean and well maintained equipment. PF is still pretty new but I'm always seeing gym users and employees wiping down equipment and cleaning. If something ain't working its usually fixed asap.
-Almost everything is in pairs. If someone is using the 10 lbs dumbbells there's another set of 10 lbs dumbbells. If someone is using the leg extension machine there's another one. 
-Equipment are organized and spaced out. Arm equipment are grouped with other arm equipment, back equipment, chest, legs, abs, etc.
-Lots of TVs at least 20.
-Showers always a plus.
-The staffs friendly.
-Temperature and environment is set right.
-Gym is open 24/7 and the staff is there 24/7.
-The Lunk alarm keeping lunks in check.
-Ive never seen it too busy.
-Free pizza and donuts once a month!!!

Cons (not really cons its more like limits or what they're not offering):
-If you want to bench your options are smiths machine or max out with 75 lbs dumbbells.
-Free weight barbells limited to 65 lbs.
-You bring your own towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Its not a motel.
-You can't drop weights, they'll scold you or you'll set off the lunk alarm. 
-No sauna, swimming pools, basketball courts, scales to weigh yourselves.
-Cardio machines don't have USB connections so can't charge ur phones while running a long time. Sorry Android users with bad batteries.
-No free weight Olympic bars.
-3 showers.
-No classes like LVAC, 24hr fitness, or Gold's Gym.

A great chill place to sit out on the patio and enjoy the beverage of your choice and some pizza. I went here with a group of Yelpers as Fate Brewing was the payoff after hiking Pinnacle Peak on our Hike & Brew UYE.

First of all, the service was outstanding and individual checks were written without any fuss. It was gorgeous day outside for some conversation, drinks and food. I had the sausage pizza with goat cheese sans the mushrooms. That pizza was wall to wall sausage. I unfortunately negated the calories I burned hiking by eating that pizza but my tummy was very happy. The pizza tasted very good and was reasonably priced.

I might have to try some other items next time but to tell you the truth it would be hard to pass up on that pizza.

Finally! Soon dubu that doesn't require me having to drive down to Chinatown!

I have dined in and ordered take-out from K-bop and every time the food has been delicious and consistent. Our orders vary but generally soon dubu (spicy tofu soup) and bibimbop (rice bowl with vegetables and meat) are always staple items.

Dining in, the service is very good and I love that they stay open late! It's a perfect on-the-way home stop for comfort Korean food.

Two strikes you're out Barrio Cafe. I love supporting local businesses and have been so pleased to see the arrival of so many to the airport but when I'm at the airport I must put efficiency first. This is where barrio Cafe sadly fails. In the future I will stop in for a drink but I will only sit at the bar and nothing more. This is because the service is sadly some of the worst I've experienced. On two separate occasions I've eaten here and both times the lack of service have almost cost me to miss my flight. After serving the food the wait staff seems to disappear and it's impossible to find them. I would ask and ask and then when I note my need to hurry for fear of missing my flight I have been snidely commented to by the staff. The food and drinks are good but I think the customer service and efficiency needs major improvement if they want to be successful in an airport environment.

There's a buffet that's been on my mind...all the time
Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh oh
Now I know that it's not on the Strip, but with a car you can get there in a zip
Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh oh

Tucked in the corner of the M
Plenty of options, it's a gem
Fresh are the off'rings at this buffet
I ate so much, at least five more pounds I weigh...
Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh oh
Five more pounds I weigh-ay
Stu-Stu-studio! oh oh oh

Veggie options bountiful!  And the taste of them are wonderful!
Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh oh
The Brussels sprouts and broccoli, the kale and salads all appealed to me!
Stu-Stu-Studio! oh oh oh

I got a big piece of soft prime rib
With so much au jus I needed a bib
Desserts great selection but just so-so
Creamed spinach so good, just for that it's worth a go-oh!
Stu-Stu-Studio!  oh oh oh
It's worth a go-oh!
Stu-Stu-studio! oh oh oh

Show your California Drivers License when you pay
They'll take $5 off of your buffet! (until July 31)
That's around $20 on a weekday
Hotel is so nice, next time here want to stay!
Stu-Stu-Studio! oh oh oh
I want to stay-hey!

For the price, it's the best buffet in Vegas!

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

This pizza shop came highly recommended by many fellow yelpers on my Gluten Free thread so I dined here today. I chose to build my own pizza. Gluten free crust, crushed red tomatoes for the base, mozzarella cheese, sundried tomatoes, garlic, crispy basil & pineapple. WOW was I impressed. The guy behind the register also informed me they would be getting a much better gluten free crust next week, and I even thought this one was great! So happy this place was recommended it was Delish! I even ate my whole pie... Haha

Next time, light some candles and play Marvin Gaye before you screw me.

I've been here before, but for some reason I decided to give it another chance.  Kind of like that ex-boyfriend who dumps you but then happens to call you out of the blue when his friends are visiting (he wants to show them he's dating someone really cool) and tells you to wear heels and a short dress and then introduces you as his trophy GIRLFRIEND but dumps you AGAIN when his friends fly back home and you end up feeling even WORSE than when he dumped you the FIRST time.  

Phew, you catch that?!

Anyhoo... this is the second time that the hostess wouldn't seat us outside when all of the tables were available.  Pretentious waitstaff, rubbery pizza, wilted salad, tasty bread (but they'll only bring you one piece, so grab a big one from the basket), prices in line with the area but NOT justified by the lack of quality fare.

I should have learned my lesson the first time.

When I first started buying BB I thought it was the greatest thing EVER!! 
I got tons of beautiful produce and I loved going early to help distribute the Baskets. 

Little by little my basket became more and more unusable. The quality went down hill. 
I would be getting the same things week after week, things that were next to rotten upon receiving, everything was sooo dirty and some things that I would just never use, like 6 onions and 6 bell peppers. 

I recently switched to all organic and I thought I would order one of the organic baskets this week for a change. 

I've got to tell you I feel robbed. Honestly this basket sucks! Most of the items weren't even labeled as organic and I wasn't able to volunteer this morning so I don't know for sure if they even are. 

I don't know about you but I don't need 3 bundles of celery. Again the filth that these veggies are covered in is inexcusable. 

I spent $18 last week at the OTFM and got so much more CLEAN organic produce. BB charges $25 for their organic basket of junk. 

I will not be ordering these again. You really could do better at the grocery store or farmers market if you want produce and then you can choose to buy locally or U.S. grown veggies.

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).

So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!  

This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.

The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.

The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.

Very inexpensive for the quality.

Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....

This is a very impressive worship space, one which I was fortunate enough to visit just before it's consecration a few months ago. 

An LDS friend gave me a private grand tour and I came away very much amazed with all the work and effort put into this Temple. The only down side was my inability to take any pictures inside. 

For those who know me, I would have normally have taken a couple of dozen pictures. So I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't allowed, per Mormon custom.  But it was something which I respected on my visit.

This is also one of the largest temples I've ever seen and the grounds are massive. Probably on a par with the one in Las Vegas. The only other LDS Temple I've been inside, is one back in Glenview, Illinois, which is tiny by comparisons. 

I left amazed and very impressed.

"You can make the reservation, but you cannot hold the reservation."

Here with a bachelor party last Saturday night and we had a table reservation for the crew. We got there at 10:30pm and they told us we we were too late (claimed we had to be there by 10pm) and they had given our table away. After some bickering they let us in and we found that half the tables in the club were unoccupied and they were most definitely not sold out. 

With some pushing we eventually claimed a table and the night was saved. My poor friend who organized this part of the bachelor party weekend definitely lost a few hairs from the stress of the table initially falling through.

XS charges way too much money to screw up like that, so even though it's one of my favorite party spots in Vegas they only get 3 stars.

Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop.

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

Yanni's Gyros impressed me. I ordered a Lamb Gyro and let me just say, holy sh!t that thing was f'ing huge! It was packin! I have a BIG mouth and still I was struggling. I felt like I needed to summon my inner garter snake and dislocate my jaw to eat the damn thing. It was gigantic! And YEP... That's what she said! *snicker*

So... absolutely NO ordering the gyros if you are on a first date here ladies! On second thought, that includes you men too! That is, unless you want to show off your skillz getting down and dirty with your big mouth. Small mouths need not apply! Unless, of course, you want to get all dainty and show off your badass table manners with your plastic knife and fork cuz that would be equally impressive. Haww!

Summary: Big portion size? Check. Good food? Check. Cash register lady nice? Check.

Scoreboard:  BB 1 - Gyro 0
It sure put up a good struggle but I let that thing have it!!! That thing didn't stand a chance!

My Advice: Bring your big ol' mouth and appetite over to Yanni's Gyros and they will not disappoint. Be prepared to get nickel and dimed over their yummylicious tzatziki sauce though. It's 50 cents a pop for a small plastic container of it. It is good though, like people say, and I guess they know it. 

Hold tight, Yanni. It was good for me too! I'll be back for more real soon next time I am feelin the need for all that tasty Greek meat. ;)

The service and selection at Churchill's is as good as it gets! 

A friend of mine bought me a humidor from here as a gift. There was a continual problem with the small humidifier that attaches to the inside of the lid. 

After many attempts at fixing the issue, they made the decision to upgrade me to the next size, almost twice as big as well as upgrading the humidification system inside the box. 

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with a hello and if I need anything they're right there to take care of me. 

I drive out of my way to go here and this is the only place in town that I'll buy my cigars from.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 34/100

Nice Tory location! Supposedly they're moving it to a different space at the Caesar Forum shops later on this year, but for now it's by Henri Bendel and the MAC Cosmetics store.

Came in here the other day just to browse. I wasn't planning on buying anything, but I always like to pop into any Tory Burch store I run into because she's my favorite designer :)

This location is kinda small. I've never seen a layout quite like this one, but there's very little room. Perhaps they're moving to take over a large space? I'm not sure.

The sales associates were very friendly and greeted me upon entry. I overheard another woman who had come in right after me. She had come from the Palazzo Tory Burch location and put a purse on hold at this location. The sales associates helped her quickly and efficiently and it seemed to be an easy transaction!

They had a great selection of Tory's shoes at this location. Unfortunately, you can't see them all laid out together because they have these weird column-like shelves where they store the shoes.

Other than that, everything at this location was great! Nothing bad about it :)

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

Eh cuz, we go grind!

Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  

Rant:
1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.
2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it "Hawaiian".
3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me "brah" or asking if I "hang ten" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.

How does it stack up?

Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.

Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.
 
A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.

A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.

Gold and girls aren't the only things that glitter in Las Vegas ... So do the streets with neon. When the glitter and neon fades, this museum's Neon Boneyard is where the neon goes to lie.

The Neon Museum is located about 15-20 minutes north of the "strip" on Las Vegas Blvd North. It's not in the best part of town, but we had no problems there at all.

 * Book a tour in advance. We showed up without it and had to come back
 * A Guided Tour is required.
 * Day tours: $18/Adult; $12/student, military, senior, or NV resident
 * Night tours: $25/Adult; $22/others
 * Buy a combo ticket with the Mob Museum for $30 (good for 7 days)
 * Open 7 days a week
 * Day and Night Tours are available; Check the website for times
 * A small free parking lot is available on McWilliams, but was full both times we went
 * The tours are recommended for only ages 10 (day) or 12 (night) and up
 * The Neon Boneyard is outdoors. Plan accordingly for Nevada weather
 * Old Neon Signs are the stars like Frontier, Binion's, Alladdin, & Golden Nugget
 * Guides give the background and history which really makes it interesting
 * Photos are allowed
 * Look for the Silver Slipper in the divider of Las Vegas Blvd. to know when you've arrived.

The Neon Museum is an ok opportunity to get out of the casinos and see some of the historic signage of Las Vegas while learning a great deal about the history of Sin City.

Did not know you could Zipline in Vegas!!! 

Buddy Ken C told me that you can zipline down Freemont Street for about 20 bucks. This definitely peaked my interest, but when the time came, i didn't feel like it- maybe it was the fear of getting stuck in the middle of the zipline and having to wait for someone to come fetch me, while i hang over hundreds of people (which did happen to a girl we saw). The wait on a friday night took a very long time, over an hour. But from all the smiling faces i saw ziplining above me while i watched, it looked like a lot of fun. We videotaped our friend coming down - they sell pictures of you ziplining for $20.00. 
If ur lucky, you might get to zipline during the Queen show, where they dim the lights a bit and play "We Will Rock You". You can zipline at the same time with 3 other people, so it would be a cool group activity (you can get group prices). Maybe next time, if i get buzzed enough, i might take the "leap". I'll be sure to take a considerate plastic bag with me.

I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars "A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks.

"If you need me I'll be watching CSI from the bathtub." 

And that's exactly what I did thanks to the nice little TV on the wall in the bathroom. 

With this all suites hotel connected to Mandalay Bay I was quite pleased when we rolled in. After watching 'The Hangover' 50 times I've had an urge to step up the Vegas game and while we didn't wake up with a tiger in the bathroom I can say this was one of the nicest rooms I've had in my 20+ trips to Vegas. 

Two sinks in the main bathroom. Very nice shower and the deepest of bathtubs. Two big ass flat screen TVs in the bedroom and living room. Extra bathroom off the living room in case you have a friend who is ready to blow chunks from too much partying. 

Our view from the 24th floor had me drunkenly staring from the Mandalay pools to the neighboring hotels and off into the hills. Gorgeous. 

What an amazing stay, I could have slept the rest of my life away in that bed. So comfortable. 

People say Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel... Next time you hear that just say "Pshhhh, I'll be in THEhotel. Mandalay Bay standard is for chumps." Pretty good episode of CSI too.

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on January 5, 2014, however, my Newark Delta flight via Detroit was cancelled due to the weather. The earliest flight I could get to Vegas was two days later from JFK on January 7. My original hotel stay was at the Planet Hollywood, but, because my arrival was delayed I had to find an alternative hotel.

I found the Quad, which was the former Imperial Palace on the strip. I never stayed here but, as a Total Rewards member their last minute room pricing was the most reasonable so I reserved a room. Big mistake.

When I arrived I found the taxi had to drop me off at the rear of the hotel due to the hotel construction still going on. I noticed a lot of young people checking into the Quad I guess due to the low room cost. My check-in was smooth. As you can see from my room pics, my room was ok, which was fine. 

My only complaint about this hotel is the construction going on in and around the hotel. Some areas of the hotel are still well worn. The hotel location is fine between Harrah's and across the street from Ceasar's Palace.

See the pics of my TR1724 room, which I paid $136 for the first night and $169 for the second night in early January 2014.

I would probably not return here. I much prefer Planet Hollywood or any of the other strip hotels, which do cost a little more.

The Chandelier is a multi-story love bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's a memorable setting with memorable drinks and plenty of unique couches, seats, and tables. It's easy to find a spot just right for you and your friends.

Plus one star for having several flavors of Hangar One Vodka available!

Another bonus star for super friendly, but efficient servers. No complaints at all.

My wife rated the Cosmopolitan hotel's house Cosmopolitan ($15) her favorite drink in Vegas. If she's happy, then I'm happy. 

I was looking for something different and tried a cocktail called Bruce Tea ($14) with Kai Coconut Pandanus Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Lemongrass-infused Coconut Cream, Birdseye Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves, and sprinkled with Matcha Tea Powder. It was too different. I switched to Hangar One Mandarin and Tonic ($14) for the rest of the evening.

If you are staying or visiting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it will be hard to miss the giant crystal strands of the Chandelier. It may not be a destination bar, but it is the best bar at the Cosmopolitan. Don't miss the opportunity to relax for a few rounds of drinks.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 37/100

The bf and I paid a visit to the Conservatory & Botanical Garden at Bellagio this past weekend :) It was all decked out for Chinese New Year, with festive decorations everywhere, incense burning, a tree made out of gold coins, and a giant mountain with practically full-sized horses in honor of the Year of the Horse. It was wonderful!

I hear they re-decorate it to match whatever season/holiday is going on at the moment. I would love to see each of the rotations in a calendar year!

The Conservatory is located just past the lobby in the Bellagio hotel - very easy and quick to get to. It has wonderful natural lighting coming in through glass panes in the ceiling, and has beautiful flowers and plants planted everywhere. Great photo op spot as well!

It actually wasn't as big as I remembered it to be when I came here as a child...but nonetheless, definitely something worth seeing during your visit to Bellagio!

There is a garden gift shop nearby where they sell nice souvenirs and trinkets :) There's also a store that sells the beautiful glass flowers hanging from the ceiling in the lobby of the hotel, but I'm sure they cost an arm and a leg just for one!

Over the last few months, Fresh and Easy has been morphing into a Convenience Store. It's less a traditional grocer now. 

F & E business model was setup for the professional or working couples, who were on the go and just wanted to stop by to grab something quick. 

Well, now they've taken that concept to the next level and removed several aisles (primarily soda) to make room for coffee and drink kiosk, along with chairs and tables.  

I'm not sure how that is working out for them, since there is a AM/PM right next door doing a brisk business. When I was here recently it was empty. The Fry's up on Shea and 90th has a wine bar and they're always packed. Go figure.

I was number E-31

I arrived at 1:45 or so to get a replacement card.  It's been a while. Almost thirty years since I lost my original one. LOL  Since everyone is so security conscious these days, I thought I should get a replacement.  Just in case someone would want to steal it.  I never had a reason to before, still don't. One of the side benefits of working for the same company for so long.

I arrived and was asked by the armed security guard if I had any pointy objects, knives, guns or a cellphone. I said no, no, no and yes. I was told to mute the cellphone. LOL  I said thank you, hit the touch screen for my number and proceed out the door to Del Taco for lunch.  

I came back an hour later and they were at E-94. Fearing I had missed my number, I went up to an open window and I was told no. Forty five minutes later they did call my number. I handed her my pre-printed and filled out form. She asked for my Drivers License, and a few questions. I had to swear that all the information I gave her was the truth under penalty of incarceration. 

She was very pleasant. I wished her a nice day!

I'm not demanding when I go to a theatre; all I ask is that the chairs are clean, the floors aren't sticky, and that the screen is big, bright, and easy to see--whether you're in the neck-breaker seats up front, or the make-out bunkers in back.

Anyway, Archie, I already know the tickets and snacks will be a ripoff; that's just standard practice, whether you're at the movies, ball game, or drinking flat intermission champagne at some sad, community theatre production of Hamlet.

Harkins Fashion Square 7 meets my diva requirements just as well as any other theatre. It's attached to a mall, and you enter through the mall, too. So, conceivably, you could sneak the slightly-cheaper food from the food court into the movies, if your purse, backback, or 1992-ish raver pants are big enough.

Skinny jeans? Forget it. That freezing, 20 ounce bottle of Coke Zero is going to make me sterile. I mean YOU sterile. 

You.

Me and my David Schwimmers are maverick, dangerous, and NEVER on a break.

Dangerous, I tell you!

Anyinsecure...

The clientele at this theatre is typically quiet, young adult, and suburban. You won't get too much cellphone ringing, talking, crying babies in R-rated movies, or late-comers stepping on your new Jordans as they go for the middle seats.

Overall, a decent theatre, but I docked one star because the red-vest-wearing guy who sold a box of Mike and Ikes to me seemed really methed out, and he kept scratching at invisible scabs, swatting at imaginary dragons, and warning me not to let the White man hold me down.

He was White, too, and I know one employee doesn't represent a company in totality, but it was creepy, and I'm a total bitch.


Harkins Fashion Square 7

Cleanliness = More than Fair
Movie Selection = Stellar
Snack Choices = Michelle Gellar

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

What's not to love about the Fountains of Bellagio? It's free. It's beautiful. It's captivating. It's the only thing in Vegas that never seems to get old for me. The entertainment from the combination of dancing water, lights, and music is mesmerizing. With 30 plus songs, hearing seeing the same performance is few and far between which helps make the Fountains one of the most dynamic entertainment options in Las Vegas.

The schedule varies by day, but basically they occur every 30 minutes during the afternoon and early evening and then from 6:00, 7:00, or 8:00 (depending on the day) every 15 minutes until midnight. My recommendation is to visit the fountains  at least three times. See power of the water in the daytime. See the beauty of the Bellagio, sky, and lake at sunset. See the majesty and mystery of the lights and water at night.

The variety of songs range from classical to pop. You'll find Faith Hill's kitchy "This Kiss" or the Sin City anthem of Elvis belting "Viva Las Vegas" just as likely as you are to hear Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli's inspirational "Time to Say Goodbye." The water is choreographed in complex patterns from 4 different types of water fountains that spray water in spherical motions or shoot water straight upwards. The tall blasts of 240 or 460 feet in the air are true crowd pleasers while the smaller jets appear to be truly dancing to the music.

It all takes place in the 8-acre lake directly in front of the Bellagio. The firm WET Design was the mastermind behind the $40 million water show that features more than 1,200 spouts and 4,500 lights. Kudos to them and the Bellagio. 

The Fountains of Bellagio stand out in a city full of temptations and entertainment as a simple, timeless, and beautiful way to spend a few minutes letting your heart and spirit be a kid again.

As a gay man, I came here to support one of my best friends at a bachelor party. Even though I informed every stripper that approached me that I am gay and not interested, two of them proceeded to give me simultaneous lap dances against my will. I told them to stop, but I couldn't exactly push them off of me without getting into trouble with security. Then they had the nerve to charge me. Yes, I was at a strip club, so I kind of brought this all on myself, but I feel the need to comment because, geez, if the strippers are that pushy with an openly gay dude I can't imagine how pushy they would be with a straight dude who didn't want a lap dance. 

There are guy strippers upstairs but the club has a strick "NO GAYS" policy, so gay guys really aren't welcomed here. If you have a group of ladies/bachelorette party and plan on inviting gay friends, you should call ahead and make sure they will be allowed in with you upstairs (perhaps OG might make exceptions if notified in advance, but I honestly doubt it).

Maybe its just me, but can we get with the times people? It's 2013; gays and straights hang out together. I'm not saying cater to gay people, just make us feel reasonably welcomed if we come with a straight group.

Get the Banana Cream Pie!!! (5 stars!)

Hope to come back here soon to try dinner and more of that pie, but i had to yelp about the delicious pie. For one order, they give you a pretty big portion. My friend got it to go, and it still held up after a couple of hours. We dug in and i loved the crispy crust with the creamy custard. The bananas and chocolate combined with that makes it so dreamy.

Wear a sweater that's more embarrassing than my dye-job and my behavior?  Okay, count me in!

It was another fun night with Yelp Phoenix!  We showed up later than anticipated but we still had two hours of mingling, sipping hot mulled wine, and nibbling on what looked like a delicious spread [no time to eat when there was people to jabber with!].  Entrance was pet food and/or a pet gift that was donated to the Arizona Animal Welfare League.  Yelp Phoenix knows how to keep it classy by giving from their hearts.  50+ people were in attendance and we were allowed to bring a +1 so we got to sneak in our non-Elite friends to show them how we party!  There was a cookie decorating station, an ornament deco station, the *real* Santa, a hot chocolate bar, a White Elephant gift exchange, and a chance to go ice skating outside.  The venue itself is urban chic and lovely.  The servers were generous and were a delight to strike a conversation with.  My voice is absolutely coarse from all the laughter and chatter and I'll drink my hot tea tomorrow while thinking back to this amazing night fondly.

I'm a bit confused though.  It says we were suppose to be at an Ugly Sweater party but I was clearly at a GORGEOUS sweater party!  Between Brett B.'s eye-gouging snowmen and Susan P.'s twinkly green light bulb earrings, Tom D.'s vomiting Rudolph with a Solo cup on the antler and Linh L.'s jingling Christmas poncho, Melodie C.'s starry vest and Meghan L.'s short-sleeved sweater, I thought I was at a fashion show in Milan!  Where did you all get such stylish sweaters?  Don't get me started on Cheryl B.'s adorable Grinchiness, Kurdy S.'s stripper Barbie sweater, and Kazi H's overflowing cuteness.  ;)  Although I'm not sure if I'd get my bum pinched by Melodie if I were in Milan --- that cheeky ginger!  Also, "I'm Anime Melodie."

Thanks a million to Yelp, Lindsey and her cute baby belly, Santa [I swear I'm on the Nice List... maybe], DJ Sterling for a night of festive tunes, the folks at The Corner for hosting us wackos, and CityScape for tickets to ice skate!  

Happy holidays, everyone!  I hope to see you all in 2015!

The Tempe Art Festival is a blast!

We love coming down for the Festival at least once a year.  Usually we hit the Fall event, but this year we came for the Spring one for the first time. We also try to come either very early as it opens, or toward the close around 4:30 pm.  That way we avoid the heat of the day and the crowds.

Mill Avenue is totally blocked off and there is a carnival like atmosphere here. Well, at least more so than usual. LOL They have jugglers and street performers.  Folks drawing pictures and caricature alone the sidewalk and much more as they say.

There are also Arts Festivals in Care Free, Scottsdale and Fountain Hills as well. They're scheduled either before or after this one. But we like this one the most, because it tends to be lager then the others (well maybe not FHs) and it has the added benefits of all the restaurants in and around Mill Avenue. Nice!  

This year we tried the HH at La Bocca Urban Pizzeria. http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-bocca-urban-pizzeria-wine-bar-tempe#hrid:O3ctYrNgJDYoj_k-erYzDQ

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

I visited Al-Hana for the first time today for an Unofficial Yelp Event with Rand H., Robyn N., Mike C., Jackie C. and the other Jon H. I enjoyed some great Hummus and Pita Bread plus my main course of Lamb Kafta for $8.99 and a can of soda for $.099; this meal set me back $10.75 today.

Prior to arriving, I perused some reviews and the menu. Pro Tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned. I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant. There was decent parking at about 11:10 when I got there. 

As I'm writing this review 4 hours later, I can tell you that I'm still stuffed. I really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions. Thanks to Rand for "inviting" me. I probably would have not tried this place otherwise.

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

Service is friendly and very efficient.

Very good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note:  Use your Total Rewards casino card to get a slight (5-10 percent) discount.  Tier does not matter.

For my birthday weekend, I simply could not refuse an all inclusive triple threat package offered by the esteemed Wynn resort, which included complimentary tickets to Le Reve, room upgrades at the hipper and edgier Encore suites, VIP access to XS and free buffet! I know, It was pretty much a no-brainer in my book.  

Upon arrival at the Encore, parking was a breeze! Complimentary valet had me out of my car and in the registration line in a snap! Speaking of registration, I was convinced to "upgrade" my existing upgrade to a 60th floor panoramic suite. I know, I'm weak, but i'm glad I gave in! The upgraded room was magnificent! It came with an expansive living space with two plush queen beds, large bath with shower and separate soaking tub and outstanding views of the Las Vegas strip!  And who can forget about the remote controlled curtains and bathroom TV ;)  Tack on top of that premium gaming options, the exquisite resort grounds, and exceptional dining options, which include sumptuous tapas at La Cave and spectacular brunch fare at Tableau, and you've got yourself one happy birthday boy!   VIP access to the hottest clubs on the strip like XS and Surrender and premium shopping at premier boutiques like Herms, Chopard & Louis Vuitton doesn't hurt either.  If golfing is your thing, Steve Wynn's got the largest 18 hole golf course on the Strip!  

Honestly, I practically spent my entire weekend here and rarely felt the need to ever leave the grounds. Now that's not an easy feat for any resort given all the tempting hotel and entertainment options out there!  

Happy Times!

"It's like a jungle sometimes, 
It makes me wonder, 
How I keep from going under..."

hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.

the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacos

but alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.

the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.

4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.

i took a star from the bland horchata and semi remote location.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

"SAKE SAKE BOOM BOOM !
SAKE SAKE BOOM BOOM !"

Oh, not right now? Well, if you had a fun group like we did and everyone was doing sake bombs then that is what you would be chanting before you take your group shot. Remember to out-do any groups surrounding you.. That's what we tried to do. Tip: Try their pomegranate one ;)

I have been here before when it was Geisha House and it did NOT impress me so I am glad that it is now Kanji. If you have never tried teppanyaki before then I suggest trying it here so you can see it done right.

The staff is attentive, hilarious, and will drink with you. 
Pro Tip: Do the Ji Shot (thank me later).

My favorite starter was the Beef Tataki, great presentation and tasted amazing. The egg rolls and shrimp tempura were also ordered and shared amongst all of us. 

Our teppan chef was Joshua, who was very skilled and entertaining. He kept our group cracking up the whole time he was cooking our food on the iron griddle. Thanks for giving us food shaped as a big heart, Spongebob, flowers, and all the other things you came up with during the cooking process! It was all so delicious, especially the steak.

I will be back for more and to try out the Green Tea Cheesecake that I was too full to order!

When you're far from home, the minute you see a familiar face out in that huge sea of people, you instantly smile. That's how I feel everytime I see the Hawaiian Air Las Vegas ohana... They have that island style spirit that our Hawaii is so famous for. You can tell that they miss home too, in the islands and for them, like us, it's nice to see familiar faces. Hawaiian Airlines has always been my go to carrier when traveling to the west coast and Vegas. They've since moved operations from the old International terminal and now operate out of the new Terminal 3, D concourse. Access by a high speed tram is so easy. The new digs also offer us travelers access to new shops, concessions and yes, slot machines! But getting back to our Hawaiian ohana, it helps to have friendly staff with the Aloha spirit since a lot of times we as travelers need assistance at the gates, etc. I have never felt guilty of like I was bothering any of them whenever I had a question or concern about something. Traveling can be intimidating for some, confusing to others and just downright unpleasant. It sure helps when you have a friendly face to talk to at the beginning of a long journey home and a smile. That alone will cure your anxieties! Keep up the good work Hawaiian!

Oh, and btw, be sure to download the Hawaiian Air app if you have a smartphone, it's so convenient and easy to use. Check in, change seats, upgrade, do it all from the app! You'll never be scrambling to find a computer anymore!

Located on Las Vegas Blvd near Charleston. In the grungy area so usually do it in the day and it's not good for big parties as the dining room is really small.

This is a follow up review and I Love this place. 

But I'm not over selling it and dont expect a fancy looking decor and designer napkins - it's not gonna happen. The waitress and t.v. are set for spanish...cuban style so be ready.

Lunch pollo criollo , black beans, avacado salad and iron beer.  All we're bangin my drums and made it a better day :)

Fast service  and like eating at a relatives and all really good.

Been eating here for along time.

"We don't fit in" says my poker bud.

"What are you talking about" I say.

"Look around, everyone in here is Asian" he whispers.

"And what are we?" I answer dumbfounded.

"No, I mean they are like Wong Fu Asian.  You know, guys in skinny jeans carrying around stuffed animals for girls who weigh 90 pounds or less and take pics with whisker fingers" he continues.

Laughing uncontrollably "Shut up and eat your menu".

Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.

Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.

Standout examples:

Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.

Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.  

Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.

And yes, the menu was delicious.

One of things I love to do, is taking Sunday drives through Fountain Hills and stopping at the Fountain.

Since moving to the Valley, I've found there's something relaxing about doing this.  The streets are almost always empty and when you do encounter someone they are always deferring and polite.  I know we're more than halfway through 2013, but it reminds me of Sundays before the Blue Laws changed in the mid-1970s

Euro Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-pizza-cafe-fountain-hills#hrid:5OBFv-7_N9nhSi04xgy90A   has a nice view of the fountain.  I would recommend it for lunch or dinner.  Ask to sit outside by the railing unless it's too hot.. It goes off every hour on the hour. http://www.fh.az.gov/fountain-park.aspx

Enjoy!

This is the kind of place where you wait 2 hours to get in and then enter to an empty dance floor where a 40 year-old Guido is grinding on his 17 year-old daughter/girlfriend to R. Kelly's "Feeling on yo' Booty".  They were lost in the magic of R. Kelly's sweet, sexy sounds and I was lost in the magic of their bizarre, anti-rhythmic grinds.  Oh also, the dude was sporting an obvious boner.  That was his song, for real, no doubt.

What I'm really trying to say here is, it's totally worth the wait.

You can get free passes most nights by either being a non-repulsive girl or hanging out at the exit to "Le Reve".  At the end of the show, tramped out "reps" from the club hand them out to people as they leave.  Table service is pretty much mandatory but you can just sit down at the end of an empty booth and easily freeload.  What else?  Oh. TERRIBLE djs.  I'm talking I heard a dance mix of the Beach Boys, "Kokomo".  You know the one Uncle Jesse played the drums on?  I know you know what I'm talking about.  Don't front.  There is only one thing worse than the original Kokomo and that is Star Jones' naked.  The dance mix is a close second worst.

Ohhhh, Wow. 

What an absolute incredible experience, that you must visit to fully appreciate.  The time, the effort, the money, that went into creating this world class museum, makes the Musical Instrument Museum a must stop for anyone living, or visiting Phoenix. 

One of the great things that made our visit special, was the integrations of the high-tech head sets that activated whenever you approached a exhibit. It is similar, but slightly different to the ones found at The Getty in Los Angeles. 

Upstairs you will find a geographical, country by country musical instrument experience, with the largest being the United States. One of the helpful visual aids is the world map showing the countrys' location.  I don't care how knowledgable your geography may be, you'll be stumped more than once. 

Downstairs is devoted to individual musicians, such as John Lennon, Toby Keith, Elvis, The Police, Leonard Bernstein, Taylor Swift, Carlos Santana, Roy Orbison and much, much more.  They actually have Roy Orbison's hand written words (see photo) of Pretty Woman. Nice!  Let's face it, only at the MIM could you mention all those artists in one sentence.  If you are into guitars, the Fender exhibit is a must stop. 

Parking is free and Admission is only $18.00, an absolute steal. Expect to spend at least two hours plus upstairs and another two downstairs. The Caf Allegro at MIM is open from eleven until two.  Their self serve Caf is open during museum hours and serves Starbucks, soft drinks, beer, delicious cookies and some lighter fair. 

Trust me, whether you start upstairs or down, the Caf will look like a oasis from all that walking.

Enjoy!!

When I was a little kid my dad would take me to Cowboy Mel's on Main and 2nd Street in downtown Anoka, MN (population 15,000). Me and Dad bonded. Mel smoked a cigar. I learned of Guns and Ammo magazine. Soon a swanky salon, called Barbie Baker Design opened on Main Street and my mom started going there. Well, I was a young, fresh, bursting at the seams, pre puberty, pre knowing I was a homo young man. One day mom asked if I wanted to get a "style cut" (WHAT IS THAT?) at Barbie Baker? I said yes. Mel was stinky and the magazine selection sucked ass. 

When we walked through the doors of Barbie Baker Design (not Salon, not Shop, but Design), the heavens opened up and the choir sang. I was in my element. Cool straight chicks and a gay receptionist named Bruce. Well. I bonded with the salon community. And ever since then enjoyed the salon experience. From Beverly Hills to Manhattan, I've had some fabulous follicle indulgences. 

Here, in Phoenix, I'm lucky enough to receive the BEST cuts from Amina at Ide Mania. Well. Today. I.Snapped. I just need a quick cut. It's July in AZ. It's like a freakin' sauna. Anything to make things cooler. 

Cut to Great Clips in a glamorous strip mall on 7th Ave and Osborn. Me entering. Nervous. Sweating. Embarrassed perhaps. 

Less than 30 minutes I left with a PERFECT summer cut. An enjoyable time with my "stylist"...I mean really there was no shampooing and she never used a scissor. But. I looked good. I mean hot even. I blew kisses at the mirror. Paid my $13 tab and threw a Lincoln her way. Yea. That's how I roll.

I love the salon experience. But I have to holla at Great Clips and the staff. Clean space. Friendly and efficient staff. And Rickie can't stop complimenting me. That is worth $13 times a hundred!

Sorry Korina.

I'm going to say that these sandwiches were the best in Las Vegas for two reasons:

1) It's one of the only sandwich places among the string of high end buffets and sit-down restaurants

2) My veins were coursing with tons of alcohol courtesy of Fat Tuesday/PURE the night before and eating meaty, carb-filled sandwiches just always tastes better under the influence. 

There was a lot to be happy about at this place, drunken bias aside:
+ Large variety of sandwiches and salads
+ Only 6 bucks, which is dirt cheap for Vegas!
+ I had the Cannonballs and it tasted really good
+ Plenty of seating with clean tables
+ They're open for most of the day and night

This place will fuel you with enough carby-goodness to get you through another day of experiencing Sin City. You should definitely consider making a pit stop here if you're around!

Cirque du Soleil performances are already a bit more sexy than the average show, but Zumanity takes it to a whole new level. If you'll notice, most of the 1- and 2-star reviews are from people who called it "raunchy" or "gross" - umm, prudes! Do you research before you go to any show. If they already require spectators to be at least 18-year-old due to "mature content," you bet your ass you're gonna see T&A - and maybe even more. 

You still see the amazing Cirque du Soleil high flying tricks, acrobatic stunts, dancing, singing, and prop sherades - but with super-sexy costumes and adult humor. Would I see this show with my parents? Uh, hell no. But our group of gals enjoyed the show.

As for the venue, there really isn't a bad seat in the house. EXCEPT - if you choose the balcony, DO NOT get the first row of seats on the balcony. You might think you're getting a great view, but the balcony bar will be in your way - whether you're tall or small - so pick the row just behind it. And unfortch, the ticket box office doesn't warn about this obstructed view. Secondly, floor seating and love seating does involve audience participation, so if you easily shy away from the spotlight, sit on the balcony. Oh, and go early for the pre-show. Kinda sets the tone for the night.

The Taliesin West is Frank Lloyd Wright's "Winter Camping Home" 

A MUST DO if you're visiting Arizona! A great way to admire and pay homage to one of America's Famous Architects - Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW)

[history]
Frank Lloyd Wright's original Taliesin home is in Wisconsin. After one of his major projects, he had money to purchase land in Scottsdale, Arizona for only $12.50/acre back in the 1930's. Frank wanted to pass on his legacy on and so he had apprentices and mentored them in Arizona and Wisconsin. Frank had drafted the architecture for his new home, but the apprentices had built/constructed the home itself. Frank named this place Taliesin West since it was located West of his Taliesin home in Wisconsin.

[tours]
INSIGHTS TOUR - 90 minutes; $32 adults (student and senior citizen discounts apply)
The insights tour is one of the signature tours at Taliesin West, which gives you a glimpse of the rooms that were built. Your fees go straight to the FLW Foundation - a non-profit organization dedicated to "conserve the priceless tangible and intangible assets that are the legacy of FLW. 

NOTE - there are several other tours available (i.e. night tours, group tours, etc) so you may want to check their website for the other packages that they offer. You can also rent out the area if you want to book weddings, host parties, conduct seminars, etc. (requires rezzies).

[limitations]
FYI - all models, drawings, designs and works by FLW and the Taliesin Architects are exclusive property of the FLW Foundation and so therefore CANNOT be photographed, reproduced, copied, duplicated without written consent. 

You may take photos throughout the tour, but your tour guide will instruct you to when that time is allowed. They are just preserving and protecting the legacy of FLW and I totally understand!  Our tour guide was very knowledgable and was able to answer questions throughout the tour. He had been a tour guide for the last 13 years! Many of the employees here know their stuff about FLW! Each tour would be different as you would get a different spin from each tour guide, but nonetheless, you'd have a wonderful experience. 

FYI -
*No smoking on tour
*Bathrooms located in the gift shop
*Parking is free
*Located minutes away from Downtown Scottsdale
*Beautiful view of the city and sky
*75th Anniversary of Taliesin West (2012)
*Correct address: 12345 N Taliesin Drive, Scottsdale, AZ 85258

If you love architecture or would like to admire one of FLW's pieces, definitely stop by Taliesin West! Highly recommended whether if you are a tourist or not!

I've been going to Casa Filipina for about four years and have always been pleased with the food. I've tried a variety of dishes like the Crispy Pata, Adobo, Caldereta, Menudo, Pancit, Chicken Inasal, etc.  They have Karaoke on Friday nights and a small three piece band plays on the weekend. They tried to get me to sing Karaoke but it takes more than a couple of bottles of liquid courage to get me singing.

My favorite dish is the Menudo. This is made with pork, carrots and potatoes served in a sauce. This dish has a similar look to the American Beef Stew dish. In addition, they serve this meal with rice and Pancit Bihon. The best way to eat this dish is to dump the menudo on top of the rice. I always say "Masarap, Busog na ako" after eating this meal. Did I mentioned that they give you plenty of food? They give you more rice if you run out of it, but I have never had that problem.

They also run a bakeshop that has all of the traditional Filipino sweets. My asawa especially enjoys the Halo Halo. And she always loads up on the sweets to take home for future consumption.

The Husband and wife team that own Casa Filipina do a great job and keep the prices fair. So check out Casa Filipina, you're taste buds will thank you.

I was about to start a new weight lost challenge, but knew before that was to start I wanted something sweet and good!  I was in the area for lunch and saw that there was this sweet looking bakery at the end of the shopping center, so I knew that's where I was headed to!

I ordered the Salted Carmel Mocha cupcake to go, just from looking at it I was already drooling! You could clearly see the salt crystals on the top of the drizzled caramel!  Its my new craving, salty/sweet! Can't get enough it!

Got back to work and got to try it out! Let me tell you! The cake part of the cupcake was amazing! It was a moist chocolate with chocolate chucks inside! Yes!! Chucks!!! Yummy!!! The frosting, omg, you get a nice blend of mocha, caramel and salt!! OMG HEAVEN!!!!  This was a perfect cupcake for me!

Also for you ice cream lovin fools (I'm more of cake brownie person) they serve thrifty ice cream, I remember back in the day, that was the bomb ice cream!!  And if you have a crazy sweet tooth, they also have for sale shoots of frosting!!! Forget the cake and go straight to the sweet stuff!!!

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

Here's why you should go -- Their pull pork sandwich is very good!  House specialty BBQ is very good!  Fries are good!

Here's why you shouldn't go and all of you out there that ever worked in the food industry can relate.  Don't treat your employees like Poop! Especially, not in front of me or any other patrons of the restaurant. 

Story: We place our order with the counter gal and she relays the message one at a time to Ric. Ric yells, "How bout you tell me how many burgers total instead of telling me one by one"!  Then asked everyone else in the restaurant "Does anybody else want a burger!" while shaking his head. The gal was mortified and was holding back her tears. I felt bad! I felt so uncomfortable sitting there eating. Needless to say my burger was over spiced and too salty!  Why? I ask would you do such a thing!?  Does it make him feel empowered by such actions!?  It was uncalled for!

You, yes you out there that ever worked in an environment with a crappy boss knows what I mean.  Overall the food was pretty good, but in the end Ric left a bad taste in my mouth! - Enjoy!

I have long avoided this place for two reasons: one, I despise the food truck trend. And two, my previous experience with arepas was limited to some mystery-meat-stuffed weirdness at a bus depot in the Venezuelan hinterlands.

But yesterday, as I was driving past the street corner where the Arepa boys do business...out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the proprietors were two hot Venezuelan dudes of childbearing age. Hell-O! I did a quick U-turn and pulled into the parking lot. 

As mentioned, my previous experience with arepas left me skeptical...but the hotness of the staff, and the fact that it's not actually a food truck, but more of a dingy kiosk unadorned with Twitter and Facebook logos, convinced me to give 'em a second try. And now.......... I, too, Love Arepas!

I only had one -- the bean and cheese. But it was fantastic!! WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot). At $3.50 it was a filling mini-meal...and actually stuck to my ribs through three cocktails, preventing me from getting wasted and doing embarrassing things down on Fremont St.

IMO this is hands down the best dining in all of Vegas -- cheap, unpretentious, delicious and al fresco. You can sit at the little tables in front of the arepa pod and enjoy the scenery of the neighborhood: a strip club, a dive bar and an all-night drugstore patronized by pimps and weirdos. 

I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming here again and again and again -- and that's just with the hot proprietors. I'll come to the kiosk again, too :-)

A cool place to check out AT NIGHT for some cheesy fun! The light show is the main attraction : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=o6mHisZZA0tj7RjX7W1ccw.
Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

Come on, it's chocolate. Everybody loves chocolate. Errrrrrbody. 

So, why no love for Ethel M Chocolate Factory? On the drive there, you're excited like a little Violet Beauregarde and the suspense is terrible... you hope it'll last. It doesn't ... cause this chocolate factory is hardly worth the drive nor the most wonderful place in the whole world! 

It's a short self-paced walk through a hallway with a view of a factory without any oompa loompas or rivers of chocolate. It's some people running machines. We went in the afternoon and there was one person cleaning a machine. The "tour" is guiding you to a gift store with overpriced yet average chocolates. 

If my local supermarket or Costco sells Hersheys, Ghiradelli, Lindt, Cadbury, Ferrero Rocher, Guylian, Godiva, or even generic chocolate then do I really need to go here?

The small Cactus Garden is cool for a couple minutes. Of course, you just drove past a lot of cacti to see it. Of all the sites and attractions in and around Las Vegas, is this really how you want to spend your time? If so, pack up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster and head over.

The most impressive thing about the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden are the tour buses and cars in the parking lot. They prove that everybody loves chocolate. Ethel doesn't need to be like Willy Wonka and promise a free lifetime supply ... because a small free sample seems to be doing a sweet job.

Massive potential to become one of the top destinations for Japanese haute cuisine in Vegas.

Understand, if your idea of Japanese is Raku, Yonaka Modern, or heaven forbid, Goyemon, this is not your place.  Think barMASA minus several hundred bucks.

The components are there, from the authentic dishes showcasing Japanese aesthetics, and suability to the very intimate dining space and 2014 trendy, sketchy strip mall location.  That said, don't go expecting a Michelin dining experience straight from Tokyo rather honest, Japanese food in an environment to match.

Yes, the chef comes from Michelin pedigree.  Yes, he has worked with Morimoto at XEX.  But in true Japanese style, Omae himself is the chef and personally prepares the dishes served.

Selections form the three course lunch menu showcase the chefs talent.  An incredible multi layer vegetable soup with a base of sweet edamame and mixed green veg puree with shitake, above a sweetened earthy soy gelee and to top it off, an airy puree of avocado and sake.  The unevenness of each spoonful elevates the enjoyment.  Sometimes more earthy and salty, other times sweet vegetal flavors with the aroma of the sake.

The chicken based ramen, atypical of any single Japanese regional specialty, showcases an intense chicken broth thickened with its own collagen, hints of sake, soy, and sesame that envelopes perfectly cooked, toothsome wide ramen noodles.  Tender pieces of mirin marinated then just grilled through chicken atop with a soft poached egg.  Very well balanced dish.

If these dishes are any indication of what we can expect from the chef as he expands to dinner service, this could be a real winner.

Note:  $20 three course lunch only until 08.31.14.  $100 multi course dinner 09.03.14 until the end of the month,  $150 thereafter.  Reservations for dinner service required.

Leonardo Da Vinci - Genius.   Me - Not so much.

Clearly, I am not a mastermind like Da Vinci because I actually paid for the Da Vinci - The Genius exhibition at the Venetian Hotel's Imagine Exhibitions Gallery. Olivia and I thought we were getting a deal, but even with a $5 coupon (from those little "welcome suckers...I mean tourists" booklets in all the taxis) the discounted $22 per person simply isn't worth it.

The 20 minutes it takes to walk through the display slowly while reading each description means you are paying more than a $1 a minute. So, what exciting DaVinci artifacts do you see for that rate? None. Like most things in Vegas, the exhibits are just replicas or small versions of the real thing.

The exhibition has two narrow rooms with the first detailing the timeline of historical events during Da Vinci's life and then exhibiting modern replicas based on some of his drawings. Many of the exhibits are hands on, so, be ready to touch and play. Da Vinci was a true genius and this portion makes it very clear.

The second room has a large wall projection of the Mona Lisa and a list of secret facts uncovered during an HD image capture of the famous artwork a few years ago. Is it cool to see sections of the Mona Lisa highlighted and oddities pointed out? Sure. Is it nice to see what the painting probably looked like before age faded her beauty? Sure. Is it worth $27 (or just $22)? No, it isn't. The last part of the final room has a large wall projection video of DaVinci's Last Supper painting. It was short and didn't offer any new insight. It seemed to be experiencing technical difficulties with playback and color when we went through.

Everyone should admire, celebrate, and respect the life and creativity of Da Vinci. His impact as an inventor, artist, architect, engineer, and true renaissance man is probably unparalleled. My advice is to do so, but just not at the Venetian Hotel Imagine Exhibtions Gallery unless you are super bored with everything else Vegas has to offer for fun, entertainment, or relaxation. 

I'm not sure if Da Vinci was the first to say "There's a sucker born every minute.", but he probably was. Don't be that sucker by forking over cash for the Da Vinci - The Genius exhibit.

Best.Bowling.Ever. Well... not by me. I bowled terribly, but I pretty much had the best time ever doing it!

$11.85 for all you can bowl for four hours plus shoes on a Friday night?!? Bargain! $2 beers (Bud Light). I don't drink that piss water but everyone else seemed happy. 

Kick ass DJ rockin Van Halen, Michael J, Phil Collins and The Temptations!? Chickity Check!

Quite possibly the biggest parking lot in the world. I doubt it has ever been filled up.

The bartender was slower than the second coming... literally. I must have missed two round of bowling waiting for my drop top. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars and not five.

SO, yeah... I have my own shoes and ball. I'm a geek, nerd, dork, whatever. Unfortunately the sole of one of my shoes broke off in transit so I had to borrow some from the alley. They were pretty dope. I actually considered leaving the one shoe they take in collateral so I could take those awesome bowling shoes home!!

All I really have left to say is that this is the best bowling alley I have ever been to!

A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw
We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q

I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)

Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)

During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)

God help, me...I still love them so:)

I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)

There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)

Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...

That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)

It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)

What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)

They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)

They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)

Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)

Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!

They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)

It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)

This review is for Sundays Xs Nightswim with Wolfgang Gartner. Man what was amazing site. It's just surreal to see half of the people wearing club attire , and the rest wear swimwear. It's just whole different vibe on a Sunday. Xs nightswim has a cool,crazy, and chill atmosphere all at the same time. Hat's off to the Wynn amazing pool . A perfect place for the pool party. Beach Club by day, and Nightswim by night. For me the best is to get a cabana so you have your space to hang out, and going in and out of the pool.
Wolfgang threw down a crazy set. His up beat music was insane. People were splashing to the beat, and that was amazing site to see, so awesome. 

The bottle service was top notch. Great service very friendly. Highly recommend doing the Nightswim Sunday's. Definitely trying to go back before the summer ends, and if don't make it back, you'll see me back here next year.

"It's not about where you've been...it's about where you're at." - Eric B & Rakim


Saturday night was the 4 year anniversary of "the Shop". 

if you dont know what the shop is, well the Shop is basicly a pseudo club on the left side of the Hidden House. it is in the now extinct bruno mali restaurant. which from what i've been told went extinct after the shop was having success and the bars owners felt it was a better investment to just close the restaurant and just serve food to the Hidden House Patrons..i think it was a successful gamble.

the shop has been under the wing of DJ Al Page who has been hand picking DJ's to play classic Hip-Hop , Underground, Funk, Soul, R&B, Dancehall, Raggae, and Neo Soul.
Al Page has managed to keep the party going Friday, Saturday  9pm till close. i hear stuff is usually poppin on Sunday and Monday nights too.. 

you can expect to hear music from Atmosphere, Beastie Boys, RUN DMC, Pharcyde, Black Sheep, Lifesavas, Lyrics Born, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Blackalicious, KRS-1, DJ Shadow, Pharoahe Monch, Common, The Roots, Jigmastas, Wu Tang, Dilated Peoples, Jurrasic 5, Aesop Rock, Del the Funky Homosapien, Moka Only, Brother Ali, Hieroglyphics, Brand Numian, Slum Village, Immortal Technique, Quannum Spectrum, Handsome Boy Modeling school, Diverse, RJD2, Eyedea & Abilities, Pigeon John, Black Michael Jackson, Dan the Automater, the Beatnuts, Buck 65, the Procussions, Public Enemy, Cunninlynguists, Outkast, Nextmen, Anti-Pop Consortium, Mos Def, Marvin Gaye, Prince Paul, Erykah Badu, Prince, Al Green, Bob Marley, Afu-Ra, Soul Position, DJ Numark, Portishead, Soul 2 Soul, ODB, Biz Markie, Malcolm Mclaren, Art of Noise, Digable Planets, Just Ice, Afrika Bambata & Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, Mantronix, 3rd Bass, Whodini, Biggie Smalls, Jeru the Damaja, Craig Mack, Sugar Hill Gang, Stevie Wonder, Old LL Cool J, Funkadelic, Parliament....and similar shit.

cover charge is usually 5 bucks and it's a cash only bar on the Shop side. but seriously its worth it. the drinks are cheap and the beats are sick.

i took a break from the shop as a long time regular..but i figured i would come in and check out the 4 year anniversary party and the place was jumping from 9 till close. got smashed drunk on 20 bucks.

Pomo Phoenix is near perfect in every way. 

We came here last weekend before a play at Herberger Theater and it reminded us sooo much of their original on Scottsdale Road. Great ambiance, with the owner hovering around, making sure everyone was having a good time. Nice!

We started off with some bruschetta and plate of Carpaccio. Both were delicious. We shared a Regina Margarita and it just took us back to their old location. Wonderful. 

They say you cannot go back, well this Pomo's is pretty darn close to the original. Four and a half Stars rounded up to Five. Expect to pay $45 for two, including taxes but not gratuities. 

Enjoy!!

When my sister and I were little, we used to rebel against the very idea of a thrift store. We hated the smell (you know, the one that reminds you of visiting a nursing home) and were horrified by the thought of wearing something someone else had worn.

To this day, I'm still not thrilled by the idea of hand-me-downs from an unidentified stranger. That being said, my husband and I stumbled upon the every other Saturday 50% off sale at the Goodwill on Camelback and have been pretty excited about going back since. We were in this part of Tempe this morning, saw this location, and realized that it was not only a much bigger location than the Camelback one but also that it was again 50% off Saturday. 

We didn't spend long here--there's that smell, after all--but we did come out victorious. For $40, we emerged with two *huge* house plants for $7.50 each, a gorgeous silver pot/vase for $5, 3 sun dresses for me at $3.50 each and a t-shirt for $2.50. Once I wash the clothes with my own detergent, all I'll remember is that I would have paid $100 or so for these items anywhere else. 

If you can get past the physical and psychological barriers to buying used clothing, you might find some really cute and cheap items--and score yourself some deals on home decor items. And, as you can imagine, the foray into used-goods land feels all the more worth it when you go on a 50% off Saturday and get the stuff for even cheaper.

ALERT!  ALERT!  5 STAR BURGER JOINT! GREAT PRICES! FRIENDLY SERVICE!

AM I SHOUTING?!  

Oh, sorry. I tend to hit "caps lock" when I have headphones on.

I had lunch here with my wonderful wife, my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).

Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.

Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's, which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.

We did chat with the owner, Lobby.  Nice guy, great local business.  Go here.

That awkward moment when a club is suppose to show off what it has on opening night. I guess it was to bad I was a dude. Arrived late because honestly everything starts at 11pm anyways, to be told, as almost ever other guy in line, the would not be letting anymore males in. This happens at most places in Scottsdale but given the fact it was me and three women I thought I would be fine, but was very mistaken they were told they could go in, but without me, cause that made sense.

None the less, I guess I will not be spending my money here.

One of the best hotels in Las Vegas. The customer service is first class. If you are gambler or non gambler you will be treated with great service. I love the hotel VIP customer service and fast room service. If you are looking for a location on the strip that is steps away from all the attractions and main casinos you found the place. 

If you are person who enjoys gambling and looking for an excellent casino host I would highly recommend Mickey Petkus. Mickey has been my casino host for over 16 years and Mickey is really an excellent host. 

If you are just coming here for a night or a weekend you will love it. The hotel has excellent restaurants to clubs. It all depends how what your evening brings you.

People say that variety is the spice for life. I couldn't agree more so that's why I ventured out to Cafe Zupas from my normal rotation.

I decided to get a large make your own salad along with a soda for $9.29 (inclusive of tax). They give you plenty of mixed greens and about four ingredients on the salad. I could probably fit all the ingredients that they gave me on a hot dog. If you stick out your hand and look at your ring finger and pinky that would have been about the volume of chicken in the salad. I may have gotten somewhere between a 1/3 to 1/2 of a hard boiled egg as well. They chop up the cucumber and tomatoes very fine. Maybe a couple of teaspoons of each ingredient.

It's safe to say that I won't be fooled again.  At least I enjoyed this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QtO2KYwVE   (start at 1:14).

In my best Charlie Sheen, "Windsor. Winner. Windsor. Winner!"

I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.

Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would "double dip"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!

My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich. 

I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy. 

Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!

If I ever got the urge to become a stripper, I would get a job at Bandaids. As Dottsy so eloquently explained, these are your average, run-of-the-mill girls you would find working in your neighborhood. I can't compete with the likes of Candy and Barbie at the Scottsdale clubs, but I may be able to hold a candle to girls of Bandaids.

While I must admit I have less of an imagination than Dottsy (I don't find myself wondering what people would look like if they stripped. Often.) I recognize and appreciate this establishment for what it is. 

I had my power hour here back in the day when the hooch stopped pouring at 1am. This is really very irrelevant to my review, but at the same time, seems wrong to omit. 

I kind of feel like they used the remnants of someones drink for my vodka tonic this past Saturday, which is unfortunate because I paid $8, but the $6 Corona served me well and I was not horribly chapped by the high cost considering this is a strip club.

As a woman, I don't have to pay a cover charge. That means that I can walk in and look at boobies for free. Wait, why am I not giving this place 5 stars???  

Really what more do I need to say?

An exclusive restaurant in a restaurant serving outstanding teppanyaki.

No knife juggling.  No onion volcano spewing fire.  No shrimp tails flying through the air.  This is about modern Japanese teppanyaki made with the freshest, highest quality, visually stunning ingredients.  No "ugly" produce; a perfectly formed, evenly colored eggplant, baby bok choy with no holes in the leaves, you get the idea.

To start, the spicy octopus is incredible.  Lightly grilled with slivered jalapeno peppers, sweet, spicy, tender.  Borrowing from the menu of barMasa, the otoro with osetra caviar, absolutely phenomenal, the salty, brininess of the caviar enhancing the fatty fish.

Australian wagyu for mains.  Two cuts (fillet or rib eye), both approaching A4 quality.  The fillet is well trimmed, the rib eye, less so,  If you like to savor the fat around the edge of your steak, this cut is for you.  Tender, juicy, cooked to temperature, served with a spicy cilantro verde that brightens and intensifies the sweetness of the beef and a spicy red chili and soy that brings out the savory, beefy flavor.

For sides, it's hard to pass the maitake with truffle butter.  An umame explosion that works well with the beef.

Finally, the wagyu fried rice (a filler) is different and over the top.  Black and red rice are combined to create a nuttier flavor.  Fat from the wagyu adds richness, onions sweetness. 

Service is excellent with two servers assisting a single table.  

The restaurant shares the same outstanding sake list as barMasa.  Vegas resort pricing.

While not up to the standards of Michelin rated teppanyaki restaurants of Tokyo, Tetsu delivers a solid, authentic experience at a far more reasonable price.

Okay, I've been holding back on this one.

For three years I have been coming here dropping off my collared work shirts. Over that time, the wheels have started falling off this place  In my original review, I mentioned how management tries hard and when they goof, they try and fix it.  Let me give you two examples.

After writing my original review, four of my shirts started developing tiny holes on the back collar.  Pin size, all in the same place, right rear.  After a few cleanings, the holes became pencil size.  Well, I complained and was given a nearly two hundred dollar credit for the damage. They didn't replace the shirts. But I felt at the time an effort had been made to reach out and make amends.  Hence, my original Three Stars (now lowered to One).

A year later, after I replaced the shirts, my new ones started developing stress tears on the breast pockets. I thought, what the...#$&%!  So I pointed it out and they said I must be doing something to the pockets to cause the rip. 

They offered me a $85 credit toward future cleaning after damaging five shirts!!  I took the credit and decided to move on.  Not surprisingly, many of my co-worked have experienced similar problems. I feel for fellow Yelp friend Esther.  If they had damaged one of my suit...  well  Caveat emptor.

I say never again!

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

I thought my 300th review should go to a special place.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=P8mhHhcXHYDgJZDBsFPy7A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

This is one eye opening museum. One that will radioactively enlighten your day.

This is a branch of the Smithsonian Institution and like all the others this place is very thorough in letting you know the facts from multiple  perspectives. I did the self tour so I could take my time and soak in as much on this place as I could. I even met a Yelp friend Atom.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=sJt8qJbkCXpeFB_9vFhdHg#sJt8qJbkCXpeFB_9vFhdHg

The Museum kind of starts in reverse as the first display is one that shows the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan with a short premier of the A-bombs birth. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DxttT6mA5FbF1agv35diAQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

You quickly move about the various displays that include to a milti-timeline table of the nuclear era that includes popular things like what the best TV show was, what was happening in Russia  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=oVbywp4289aavJ4pThd8Hg#FhcKP7e0Ueul1pLzHKiLGA  and what kind of nuclear testing was being done at that moment in time. A very interesting history lesson.  

There is a letter penned to the US government from Albert Einstein from 1939 (well before WWII) that discussed the future of nuclear science, power, medicine and weapons and the need for the government to secure however possible the raw materials (uranium) from places both local and abroad.

There are many cool displays from a working Geiger counter that you can use to sample display radioactive things that you'd never imagine are radioactive. I stuck my cell phone and guess what? Light radiation is emitted from a dumb phone. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=oVbywp4289aavJ4pThd8Hg#p23oO9CppodE_yTr8KQdzw

There are interactive displays and one of my favorites was the first theater where you got to feel a blast as if you were there.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=whzFsAV7dW1-ivMEOzJovQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw  This museum is rich with displays and physical / video / audio accounts of what it's like to be on the foreground of this nuclear testing facility  just outside of Las Vegas.

This is a really a historical tour of our nations past that you must have once. 5***** Stars
Additionally there is a display that I did not go to that details area 51 and all the mystery that surrounds it, heard it sucked so I didn't bother.

If you're a history buff and are a quasi-nerd like me you might just dig this place.

I'll make it simple.  Come for the food, and stay to shop.  Or, come here to shop, and stay for the food!  Either way, you cannot go wrong!

Their home made Italian sausage sandwich is $6.85 and deliecious; while their equally yummy Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is $7.50. Both are great!  

But if you come, stay & shop in their imported Italian foods section. Their meats & cold cuts are outstanding!!! Try the Capicolla at the deli counter.  It costs only $8.00 for a pound and is much better than the Boars Head brand.  They also have a decent wine selection of Barolos and Chiantis, though a bit pricier than Total Wine or BevMov.

We came here to pickup some Italian delicacies recently and stayed for lunch and glad we did!

Enjoy!

We came here for dinner tonight and enjoyed the "Firehouse" experience.  

It's kind of hard to describe or appreciate the exuberance of the employees as you come in and hear, all of them say in unison: "WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE SUBS!!!"  LOL

It's overwhelming, but a nice touch and all the employees are extra friendly. As for the food, it's very good and makes you want to come back for more. 

We had the medium Meatball for $5.99 and the large Italian for $8.19. We made the Italian a Combo for $2.49 more. Though admittedly, $18.00 might be pricey for two, but we enjoyed ourselves and the bread IS very tasty. 

One note before ordering, read carefully what condiments they put on their subs. They tend to add Mayo, Mustard, or both, to sandwiches you wouldn't expect. Pastrami & Corn Beef, or the Italian for example. LOL

So Three Stars "A-Okay" and yes, we 'll be back.

This used to be called "The Gift of Lights" at Sunset Park, but has a new name and home. The now "Glittering Lights" at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was fun and free for a 2nd year thanks to yelp. There were a lot more cars this year compared to last year. It seemed like there were a few more lights up this year, but pretty much the same light displays just put up in a different spot. The difference I notice here at the speedway vs. susnet park is there is a lot more space for lights. I just wish they filled it all up! It's too bad more businesses don't get involved and set up a light display where it's dark. There is a sign at the gate telling you which radio station you can listen to while you drive through. I enjoyed munching on popcorn and hot chocolate that were for sale by the Boy Scouts at the entrance and seeing all the pretty lights :)

I'd say the majority of Celine Dion music I've heard in life has been from dentist offices.  Needless to say, they aren't fond memories.  I clearly link "Because You Loved Me" to drilling sounds and a big light in my face.

But you have GOT to be dead inside if you don't feel something when she hits those big notes in tunes like "Power of Love" or "All By Myself" in a live setting. As a case in point, I heard a wife ask her husband what he thought of the show while exiting, and his answer was "eh".  He looked a shade under 139 years old!  Almost dead!

Not to say the show was all roses.  I found her version of "Live and Let Die" to be punchless and uninspiring.  Especially after seeing Axl's version multiple times a few weeks earlier.  

Glad I saw the show but no way in heck would I ever pay for this.  I sat stage left in the rear orchestra and a seat retailed for $175 before tax and service fees.  It's only worth it for big time fans.  Plenty of those were in attendance.  Watching people lose their minds to the "Titanic" song was very, very interesting.

My overall experience here was good, not phenomenal. Lets face it, it's a beautiful venue... Very urban San Francisco like, that I loved. But the very first impression apart from the building itself was the bouncer. He was very rude. I understand he probably deals with a lot of bs being its downtown and all but when a group of very well dressed young girls approaches, no need to be anything but nice. I was also very bummed the 2nd story (a rooftop balcony) was closed. When I asked one of the bartenders why, she shrugged & said "because it's a slow night I guess" when I also asked a different female bartender if they had wine she had no clue. Then I proceeded to ask her if they had Chopin (due to my gluten allergy I can only have potato vodka) & she had no idea what that was. A bartender named Vinny intervened and made me my usual Chopin & water. He took care of my group the rest of the night & was very helpful. You can obviously tell the majority of the staff was hired for their looks not their skills. Once they weed out the bimbos I'm sure they will do much better.  
The bar is absolutely stunning. With a very sleek look to it Commonwealth definitely sets itself apart from your average downtown bar. A lot of people are on here complaining about the prices... Honestly I think it's about time we had an upscale bar downtown. It's all apart of the revamping Zappos has brought to the area. Give this place some time to work out the kinks & I'm sure it will be a 5 star review the next time I come in.

If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.

The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.

Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their "system" which I thought was a good thing.

Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.

I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger. 

Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation. 

The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now. 

Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.

I dig faux vegetarian meats and Veggie House exceeded all my expectations.  My buddy reluctantly agreed to meet here for dinner since I am pretending to be vegetarian for the month.  It's a good thing we got here a little before 6pm on a Tuesday because every table was taken in 30 minutes with even more people waiting to be seated.  I can't think of another 2nd floor plaza restaurant doing business this brisk except for Ichiza.  Good for them!

General Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.  

I also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?

This is Chinese vegetarian heaven!  They even do ramen for chrissakes!

If I lived here I would probably be dead in a year. LOL! Walk the strip and view the freak show that is AMURRICA!

Sure, when in Vegas it's almost mandatory to take a walk on The Strip to view the sights. To me it's always better at night when everything is lit up in all it's cheesy glory! Plus, if there during the summer season walking The Strip in the day is inviting heat stroke! Damn, it's hot over here. 

Don't get fooled by the optical illusion thinking that the casino you want to walk to is close as after shlepping a half hour you realize you should have taken a cab, the monorail, or the shuttle that runs along The Strip. Still, the views of the massive casinos all lit up and the free shows make it worth a trek up and down The Strip. The Pirate Show at Treasure Island, the Volcano at the Mirage, the Dancing Waters at the Bellagio to name a few.

Hey, at least you are allowed to drink in public here so load up a cold one and have at it as you walk by the hordes of tourists, Eurotrash, bachelor and bachelorette parties, and assorted middle America white trash WalMart crowd that seems to gather here. Don't forget to view the crazies, homeless, porn card slappers, bad street performers, drunk blotto people, and those annoying characters in knock off costumes posing for money. The craziness never ends! It's almost like being in Times Square NYC!

The Las Vegas Strip is an amusement park of kitschy weirdness in itself. I love cheesy and approve totally! 

As Arnold would say - "I'll Be Back"!

In the inception of my Yelping I was giving away five star reviews like U of A was giving away TD's to ASU!  I am now learning that four stars is now my high score unless I am totally blown away and is why I am updating my review.  Yin's Chinese Restaurant is a throw back.  Their interior decor is a bit dated but adds to the ambience of the experience.  This little gem is family owned and always prefer it to a corporate spot at all costs.  The most important this about Yin's is the customer service followed but the delicious menu and topped off by the cost!  Big Bang for the buck here.  The valley has changed throughout the times but when I lived in this area in the early 90's it was really nice.  Do not let the area scare you off by giving them a chance.  Support this Mom and Pop's establishment to ensure we don't lose another.

Old school yo!

We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!

We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions! 

I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.

Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?

My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded. 

Much like myself towards the end of the evening.

The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on! 

So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!

Yo!

Venturing out and trying new AYCE spots in town! 

I am really anxious when trying new places, because very rarely does it surprise...in a good way at least.  But Naka does well!

Some highlights :

Great quality nigiri here!  They had very fresh Ahi, Sake, Fresh Sea Scallops and Hamachi.  I was surprised they had Anago on the AYCE menu, and it was pretty fresh.  The Uni was a bit watery in consistency but it still had a smooth flavor/finish.

Fresh Oysters....these were great! Love the ponzu like sauce and hot sauce combination!

Soft Shell Crab appetizer. This was a large crab, cooked well, and surprisingly meaty! Yum :)

Sashimi Salad. Lots of great tasting ahi with a tasty dressing and greens. 

Fried Jalapeno Popper...surprisingly spicy! Loved the spicy mayo concoction on top.

Service was fast and friendly.  I say if you are on this side of town, you should give it a go!

Want married men to buy you drinks while shamelessly flirting with you in front of their buddies?  One eye on you, and the other eye on basketball bets they can't afford to lose?  Come here during March Madness - or any day that ends in a "y."

Of course, our chances of meeting the single guys of our dreams were slightly soiled due to the Miss USA Pageant being held at our Hotel.  Rats!  Gosh darn pretty folk.  Try lounging poolside in a bikini, reading your John Grisham novel, when Miss Tennessee and Miss Georgia approach, block the sun, and ask if the seats beside you are taken in their  "ya'll cain't say no tuh us" drawls.  *suck in stomach? check! stick out arm? check!  feeling like hamburger next to steak? check!*

Since the Planet Hollywood was unable to do a complete overhaul of the Aladdin, they cut a few cost corners.  For example, my Hollywood-themed room had a genie lamp and some crazy swirly carpet.  Same great price and reliable everything - just painted purple and with giant PH symbols everywhere.

But the mall is still there!  There's nothing better than walking down to the lobby in the morning, taking 5 kamikaze shots, and then stumbling around the attached mall and spending the money in your "I'll get fired if my boss reads my Yelp reviews" savings account. 

They had nice ashtrays, which Lindsey and I glamorously threw up in on way to the airport the last morning.  See?  PH brought us a little closer to being Hollywood starlets.  

I look forward to seeing what else has been remodeled - in seven months, when I'm allowed to be within 100 yards of the property.

Before Bacchanal,  Before Wicked Spoon, Before the Buffet at the Bellagio, Before everyone else got on the bandwagon, This buffet started it all
Buffet Stations, each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. 

I can remember when this was the "It" or should I say the "Must Eat" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas, It's old, the ambiance is not as vibrant, the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more, but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. 

I've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum, BBQ pork, steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!

Pricing is in line with other buffer. 

Tip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. 

Everything was good. The only thing is, Las Vegas is into Great things, newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days, but it holds its own as far as I'm concern.

Food (from HH menu):

Albacore Nigiri: 3.5 stars
Smooth, good sized piece & tasty. 

Tuna Nirgiri: 3 stars
Fresh, no fishy smell / taste & good portion size.

Salmon Skin Roll: 2.5 stars
There wasn't much salmon skin inside of the rolls but more rice surrounding all of the rolls than anything. 

Squid Salad: 3 stars
The squid in this salad tasted exactly like the squid salad mixture that Costco has, except this had extra greens on the bottom of the mixture.

Dynamite Roll (Cali roll w/ baked crab on top): 3 stars
This had way too much rice & sauce on top which overwhelmed the whole roll. 

Overall: clean place with good atmosphere & good sized portioned food here. 

If you like rolls more than sashimi then you'll like this place. =)  

Service: Very slow, they forgot to check on us during the meal & we had to wave them down several times for water. -1

Gorgeous pool where the mermaids play. It's such an idyllic setting with the cascading waterfalls and calm waters. Add an alcoholic beverage to complete the picture and you're all set. Relax in this beautiful scene or meet some fun people to party with. Anything's fair game in Vegas, after all!

There are plenty of lounge chairs if you just want to kick back and recover from a long night. Grab a towel and catch some sun. Make sure to wear sunblock anytime you're outside in Las Vegas. The desert sun will own you. Guaranteed.

If you've napped long enough, take your drink with you into the pool and meet some highly interesting folks. You know how it is. When everyone's drinking, anyone can become your new friend.

So whether you're seeking the water nymph of your dreams or just have some fun, this is the place to be!

DATE TIP: The huge waterfall may *seem* like a nice romantic idea, but it's NOT romantic to piggyback someone right under the waterfall's force and just stand there forever. Once you get to the other side though, it becomes a private oasis.

THE BEST CIRQUE SHOW YET! 

I have seen Mystere, O, Ka, and Zumanity. This, my friends, outshines them all! 
From the moment you enter the beautiful theater, you can tell a lot of thought and detail went into the design of it.

If I were any of MJ's family and saw this show, I would literally be crying from beginning to end! I know somewhere, Michael himself is applauding this show for it has been done in great fashion. Doesnt matter if you are an MJ fan or not, one thing is for sure, after this show, you will have a whole new respect for the legendary entertainer.

As much as I dont wanna give away the whole show, let me give you some tidbits for describing it just doesnt do it justice! From the beginning of the show, every song they performed reflected the style and grace of MJ himself. One example was when "Smoothe Criminal" was performed, just like in the video, they did "The Lean". These guys did not try to change anything different related to the song or music video which is how it should be done. 

Mixed in between you have Cirque's signature acrobatics on trampolines and dance moves. The costumes they wear are all very intricate and detail oriented. Bravo to those costume designers and make up artists that bust their butt to make these guys look good. 

As for the lighting and sound, let me tell you, im sure they took great lengths to make sure the lighting is synchronized with the sounds. As for the sound and music, here's a little secret, they have installed 2 speakers custom built into your seats! As you are watching the show, while songs are being performed, it seems like the back up singers are literally right behind you singing! With this speaker set up, the sound is truly surround sound.

The other thing that I will reveal to you is towards the end of the show, they have a holographic image of MJ performing "Man in the Mirror" along with the Cirque performers. That portion of the show gave me the chills for it seemed like MJ himself was actually there.

So in closing, this is a show I will definitely see again! Forget any other MJ tribute show you have ever seen, this is the ultimate homage to the King of Pop.

Rouge red hotness! Of all the luxurious Vegas resorts I've stayed at (Palazzo, Venetian, Bellagio), this one absolutely takes the cake. The people and the decor: trendy, chic and beautiful.

There was absolutely nothing negative about our stay here. All of the staff was super friendly, the rooms fabulous, the food fantastic... really, I could not step foot outside the resort and be completely happy. 

I haven't been to Rehab Sunday or Wet Republic yet, but the Euro pool was a blast... after all, if you're the ones bringing the party, what does it matter where you go? Sure, there were some ladies that should have kept their bikini tops on, but you can't knock anyone who's comfortable in their own skin even if it's fake. Get to the pool by 9am to reserve prime lounge chairs, otherwise make some friends and offer to buy drinks in exchange for them.

Encore = Ultimate Fabulosity.

Btw, they have an incredible summer special going for $169/night through the beginning of Sept!

Yay, happiness is a new Buffet!     :-))

So I stopped in to this little place today & found a smallish 17-item Buffet, counting salad items but not sauces & dressings.

Lunch started with some piping hot, THIN Garlic Naan brought to the table.  Loved it!!  Then it was on to salad with Raita dressing, Curried Chicken with bone, Tandoori Chicken, Yellow Dhal, Butter Chicken, Vegetable Korma, Aloo Mutar, Channa Masala, Basmati Rice, & a rice dessert that I failed to write down the name of.

It was a little cold in there and the bathroom was out of paper towels but the dining room is nice, the service was friendly & all of the food delicious!  Good pricing too, at $7.99.     :-)

Review Noir

It was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.

I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black "Kill Your Television" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.

She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.

I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.

When I was a kid I loved the TV show Hotel starring James Brolin (before he became Mr. Streisand). I was fascinated by hotels. So much that I wanted to live in a hotel. Room service. Chocolate on the pillow. Beds that vibrate for a quarter. Well, I didn't always say they were nice hotels. While I don't live in a hotel, I practically live at The Clarendon.

Things I have done at The Clarendon. And I can't list everything because my mother reads my reviews...

Slept in perhaps the most comfortable bed in the world. 
Attended a rockin' Halloween party dressed as, c'mon, guess...Yep...Hello Kitty.
Attended photo shoots.
Had drinks by that glorious pool and waterfall.
Watched the sunset on the fabulous rooftop patio. 
Become a regular (yep, they even know my name!) at Gallo Blanco.
Had dozens of extremely happy out of town visitors stay here. 
Enjoyed the men's urinals shaped like big red lips.
Dried my hands on that amazing Dyson hand dryer (insert hands for 12 seconds and they're drier than a Napa Brut)
Left my beloved bomber jacket at GB and retrieved it the next day...honest, honest employees.

Great staff from hotel to restaurant. Attentive. Friendly. Professional. I want to move somewhere else just so I can go on vacation and stay at The Clarendon. But. Wait. I don't have to. I can simply cross the street from my pad and enjoy this fabulous Phoenix gem. 

PM for the R rated version. Chow.

I hate writing a bad review for an Asian-American owned business, but I feel it is my obligation to advocate for future patients who may suffer from neglectful and unethical practices.

Everything went wrong from the very beginning. At Medical and mental health clinics, it's not common to find unempathetic and distant desk workers. They somewhat need to act like this as a risk management strategy due to the fact that we now live in the era of HIPPA thanks to Slick Willy. But, the attitude at PROCARE was excessively cold and they facilitate an atmosphere which may lead patients to believe that they are at a for-profit clinic that only cares about billing and not your recovery. Funny thing was that when they found out I was a yelper, they started kissing my ass. Suddenly, HIPPA no longer existed and I was a VIP. 

My main issue was due to some of the unethical practices. The Dr. did not see me for more than 2 minutes, and made a rushed assessment. I was prescribed a medication which my body had a severe reaction to. I called the next day, and the uninterested front desk worker told me to "take benadryll" and go on with my life. When I explained the severity of the symptoms, she invited me back for a follow up visit, "FREE OF CHARGE". When I arrived the next day, the front desk girl said that I could not see the Dr. unless I paid. Remember that this is a for-profit clinic, and billing and making money is their number one concern. I was in severe pain due to the adverse reaction from the medication, so I just paid the money and saw the same Dr. The Dr. informed me that I couldn't prove that the medication was causing these adverse symptoms and he claimed I had an unrelated virus that was causing my symptoms. He then prescribes me an "anti-viral" drug and sends me on my way. When I went to the Pharmacist, the Pharm.D(Doctor of Pharmacology) told me that the "anti-viral" medication that was prescribed to me was not in any way an anti-viral medication and that I was given false information. She explained to me that the so called anti-viral medication was a steroid used to treat inflammation from drug-induced side effects. The same drug induced side effects I was experiencing from the prescription medication that  PROCARE claimed was not causing the adverse reaction. I now wanted to get a second opinion so I went to my usual MD in Summerlin who told me that the drug originally prescribed to me has side effects which are absolutely relevant to the symptoms I was experiencing(blistering rash, troubles breathing, swelling eyes, flu-like symptoms, swollen lips and tongue). The MD also expressed that the misleading information that PROCARE gave me could possibly have been an unethical risk-managment strategy. 

I believe the dishonesty and unethical practices are a consequence of the Dr's educational background. I did some research after all of this happened to me. If you google PROCARE's Dr, you will see that he went to an unaccredited medical school which is headquartered oversees, and he got his undergrad in South America. Most states including California, Maine, Oregon, Texas, New York and Indiana declare this medical school an "Institution Whose Degrees are Illegal to Use" or "not recognized or disapproved medical school to practice in state." Nevada is one of the only states that allows graduates from this school to practice. Even the BBC states that the medical school is only operational due to a "loophole which allows them to operate unregulated". These foreign schools recruit many from the US, and present an unaccredited scam-degree. I know from experience, years ago I fell for a scam law program which was headquartered oversees. Every time you see a professional with one of these oversees degrees, just walk away.

I am sensitive to the fact that medical doctors do make mistakes and misdiagnose at times, and the Dr. and nurses are actually very nice... but I am more dissatisfied over the  unethical billing procedures where they led me on to believe the follow up appointment was free to trick me into making the 20 mile drive over there.

This location is at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets (North) and has great deals going on. I didn't intend on coming here or even knew this store was here. After passing by I decided to step inside and check things out. The store was filled with customers as well several staff on hand to assist. The guy who helped me was very nice and helpful in getting me the sizes I wanted to try. I ended up getting 2 pairs on a BOGO deal and was pleased. They offer a variety of styles and colors and have sizes for the whole family.

As you can see, the reviews are all over the map for this restaurant. 

We would agree, though the three of us came here this past Saturday night and we very much enjoyed ourselves.  Our server Dylan was very professional and on top of things. He made our experience Four Stars!

The food was good, "A-OK" Three and half Stars, while the bill ran us about $50 including taxes, but before gratuities. The major weakness of the evening was the reintroduction of an old favorite -- Italian Nachos (see photo).  There was a lot of chips and puffed raviolis, but very little meat or cheese for $9.00.  They might want to rethink this one.

The Macaroni Grill chain has been in limbo for a while now, with several corporate owners and varying degrees of focus.  

After Brinker (Chili's) bought Maggiano's ten years ago, they tried to cheapen the brand, as a way of differentiating it.  Think Olive Garden, or Johnny Carino's.  Then it was sold to VC firm Golden Gate which tried to restore the old Macaroni Grill that Phillip Romano had in mind.  Now Ignite Restaurant Group (Joe's Crab Shack) has recently taken over, and it appears that this finally might be a good thing for Macaroni Grill!  We hope so.

Houston based Ignite closed on its $54 million acquisition of Macaroni Grill on April 9 and has named David Catalano as president of the brand.  The new ad campaign will feature Macaroni Grill's create-your-own-pasta platform. Ray Blanchette, Ignite's chief executive said. "We think it's unique to the brand and a compelling message," he added. "It delivers everyday value. We're not discounting it. We believe at the $11 price point, it's already a compelling value."  http://www.igniterestaurants.com/

When I was a little kid our neighbors sold Kirby vacuum cleaners. They were very high end, shaming our humble Hoover. Anyway, they had a German shepard named Kirby that I loved. So. Whenever I played "dog" I insisted my family call me Kirby. And they did. Along with crazy, freak child and Thumbelina. One night my mother even allowed me to eat my dinner on the floor! What was she thinking! So when I entered Pet Smart, I had this hankering to drop on all fours and start sniffing peoples' legs. But I'll save that for role playing night with Rickie. 

The store is vast with everything you could possibly need. I headed right to the diaper aisle. Poor Emilie's bleeding through her little doggina. Found what I needed instantly. Headed to the dog food aisle and got a GREAT deal on Purina dog chow. And lest I forget the queen of our castle's snacks, grabbed another bargain bag of bacon strips....which really aren't all that bad on toasted bread with a little mayo and some sliced romas. 

When I can shop at Wag N Wash I do. I know this is the Wal Mart of pet stores. I wasn't greeted or offered any help by any one. The cashier was initially friendly and insisted I get a Pet Smart card. I declined. She kept persisting saying how I could save fifty cents today even. Seriously. Two quarters. Wow. She seemed real put off by my decision. I may have, may have uttered "bitch" as I left. Fortunately if she had heard me there was a dog right next to me.

Downtown Pizza Lounge is a nice place to pop into if you're looking for a quick slice of pizza.  The basic set-up is that there are 6-8 varieties of pizza daily, and once you choose the type you it is reheated in the oven for you.  On the day we stopped in, the fresh pies were coming out of the oven so we were able to have fresh pizza, versus the reheated version.  Slices were good, and they have a few different lunch specials to choose from.  If we had gotten slices that had been reheated, I don't think they would have held up so well.   So like most other things in life, timing is everything.

The menu is fairly limited, with buffalo wings and house salads being the only other options.  But if you're in need of a quick pizza fix, go for whichever variety is coming fresh out of the oven and you'll leave pleased.  Overall, closer to 3.5 stars.  Three if you get reheated, four if you catch them fresh.

New American at it's finest.  

Combining globally sourced ingredients and flavors with classic American cuisine then trying to achieve the broadest range of taste results in incredible good eats.  It's all done without molecular gastronomy. 

For starters, the wagyu beef tartare; great beef flavor and just the right accompaniments to balance the usual cloying fatty finish (pickled mustard seeds, capers, the usual coddled egg yolk, and CHOCOLATE).  The bitterness balanced the entire dish.  

Not to be missed, the foie gras custard brulee; excellent.  Cherries for the requisite acidic sweetness, toasted cocoa nibs for bitterness and a twist, salted brioche.  Imaginative.

Finally, the roasted sweetbreads; stunning.  Bacon fat (from a thick cut piece of bacon) provides the seasoning to the airy sweetbreads they blend well with polenta and wafting umame of trumpet mushrooms.  Slightly one dimensional texturally but good eats for sure.

Salads are anything but common.  How about a heirloom tomato salad with smoked peaches and baby fennel accented by lemon pickled cucumber.  Vibrant acidity, complexity from the licorice fennel, sweet bitterness of the peaches.  Perfect.

For mains, the Iberico pork loin, cooked medium, tender with a pronounced heritage pork flavor.  It contrast well with a piece of crispy pork shoulder.  Served with a sweet, smoked date pure that makes the perfect accompaniment heightening the natural sweetness of the pork.

The 36 hour braised wagyu short rib, equally good.  One of the best braised short ribs I've had (the best being Craftsteak).  Served with an earthy horseradish potato pave and caramelized onions, glazed in its own braising liquid.  The braised beef, rich and melting the sides providing a sweet, earthy balance.

Excellent and efficient service.

The wine list remains excellent.  Vegas resort pricing.

Truly a foodies playground!

REVIEW #400.

Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  

Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.

Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. 

The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.

Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consomm, sublime.

Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.

Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.

A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between 360 - 490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!

Skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  Scarpetta excels at pasta.

While it is true, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic dcor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.

Straight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.

The tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.

Duck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.

Finally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.

Although I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.

Great wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.  

Is Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience.

Let's face Phoenix. If you say you'll never dine at a restaurant that exists in a strip mall, you're gonna be missing about 43% of Phoenix restaurants. Cherry Blossom, located in a deliciously skanky strip mall on Camelback is a true gem. Not a hidden gem, however, as I notice it's been yelped frequently and seems to be well received. I'll have to say I wasn't thrilled with my noodle dish, kinda bland. However, the sushi rolls were fantastic. The tempura shrimp in particular was mouth watering. My friends thai inspired soup was so good I almost wanted to dive in so I could simply lap it up with my tongue. But he hit me on my forehead with his spoon so I retreated back to my sushi rolls. Service was first rate. I had a manger meeting and we were there almost 2 1/2 hours and were never hurried and not once did we get the "waiter stink eye". If you've ever been privey to that, ouch, it stings! There were 7 of us and the bill came to about $100 so all I can is "come on down" cuz the "price is right" at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe....

Excalibur is the "bang for your dollar" hotel located on the strip. It's not the nicest looking, doesn't have the most amenities or the most up to date decor.

It gives you the opportunity to be on the Vegas strip at a cheaper price compared to other hotels. If you come with kids or have a big family you are traveling with then Excalibur will offer you value in staying in Vegas.

I had a bad experience with my check in where I was offered a free upgrade offering the pool view and adjacent rooms where we could open the doors to each other's rooms. Neither of those happened and we were too exhausted from the drive to complain or change rooms. 

The pool was great for the kids. They have a single slide there for kids and adults. They have a VIP pool as well. Drinks are expensive, as you would probably imagine. We ordered a bucket with 5 beers and it cost $30.

I would stay here again and here is why: I come here to walk around Vegas, not sit in my room. I don't care to pay for an expensive hotel that I come to sleep in.

The return of A5 Japanese wagyu to Craftsteak.  A cause for celebration!

The restaurant remains one of the top steakhouses serving the absolute best quality steaks in Vegas.  Backed by a comfortable, contemporary  ambiance, massive wine list and the largest single malt scotch selection in Vegas; Craftsteak has it all.

Steakhouse standard starters.  Straight forward and correct.  The simple hand cut wagyu tartare sets the scene for what is about to come.  Very clean beefy flavor.  Simple.  Sublime.

To the steaks.  Three grades (USDA dry aged Prime, American wagyu, Japanese A5 wagyu).  All very well trimmed with the wagyu grades having no visible fat around the edges.  All very evenly seared with a well developed crust.  

The standard UDSA Prime dry aged New York as expected; tender, beefy, with a good umame finish.

The American wagyu; very tender.  Olive oil viscosity on the finish.  Mild but sweet beef flavor.  If you prefer denser cuts, opt for the 14oz New York or 14oz Rib.  For the deepest flavor, the flat iron or skirt.

Finally, the highest grade Japanese wagyu; A5.  This is a treat.  Large 8oz steaks.  Good beef flavor with no mineral undertones, velvety mouth feel, no cloying fat on the finish.  The rib cap is the most flavorful, followed by the New York strip, rib eye, then the fillet.  Price reflect the quality and rarity; $190 for the rib cap, $260 all others.

The 24 hour braised short rib is to die for.  Probably the bet example of braised perfection I've had.  The connective tissue melts in the mouth and the beef moist and not stringy.  Served perfectly glazed.  Win.

Sides compliment the steaks.  The standout, the assortment of mushrooms (shitake, French horn, hen of the woods, white beech).  Simply sauted.  The perfect blend to boost the umame finish of any steak.  

NOTE:  I've been asked why do I say 6-8oz of Japanese A4-A5 is a lot to eat.  Consider this about NY strip:

8 oz USDA Choice (probably sold in your local area):  aprox 600 cal/  45g fat, / 18g saturated fat
8 oz USDA Prime:  aprox 700 cal / 60g fat / 25g saturated fat
8 oz Japanese A5: 3x - 5x the fat of USDA Prime AND $260

Get it???

Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.

Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.

I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!

I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!

Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.

OK. So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm not a bagel expert. I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July. But each time, it's perfect. Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel. Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper. I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet. UGH! I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out. Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.

The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't. The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches. You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple. There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable. 

It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe. Yep. It's 86'd. 

Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work. Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job.

Thanks to some friends coming into town I got to check out The Westin Kierland Resort, what a great looking place! Very grand.

Room 2163 was the spot, and I have to say I was sort of shocked because it was on the small side; the bathroom had a shower stall  for one, not even a bathtub. 

There was a nice size king bed that was comfy. My friends brought their dogs with them and the resort does provide kennels, food bowls and even a heavenly doggy pillow for them to sleep on, I thought that was pretty sweet.  The doors opened up to a outside seating area next to the lush green grass.  The room also had a desk, comfy love seat, mini bar, a mini sink & counter top, just over all was a very small room. 

Check out 2 of the pool areas, one where the lazy river is at, posted everywhere it says the lazy river is opened till 7, but we went for it around 6:30 and we were told it was already closed.  This pool area closed at 8pm but we just walked across and went to the pool that's opened 24 hours and hung out there. 

Over all enjoyed my time at the Westin Kierland, looking forward to booking a staycation soon!

3.5 STARS

What makes MGM Grand so GRAND?!?!
Is it because the building and all it's splendor is emerald green?
Is it because the gold gigantic lion out front can be spotted a mile away?
Is it because there is some connection to the Wizard of Oz?
Is it because they hold boxing matches here? 
Is it because they are the head company that pretty much owns a couple other casinos down the Las Vegas Strip?!

I remember staying at the MGM when I was younger and had some fam bam trips to Vegas. The rooms were decent and filled with your typical amenities of a hotel room. I think the rooms are much better in quality compared to Luxor & Excalibur. When I stayed at the MGM, the Skylofts & The Signature (luxury boutique hotel rooms) were not built yet. But nonetheless, a decent stay at the regular rooms. 

RESTAURANTS
[SUPER SWANKY]
* Joel Robuchon (French - 3 Michelin Stars)
* L' atelier de Joel Robuchon (4 Michelin Stars)

* Conference Center and Ballrooms (on the other side of the casino)

Given this laundry list of items, you can imagine how large this casino would be! It took me a good 30 minutes to get to the conference center as it is located on the opposite side of the casino! The food catered at the conference center was quite upscale and top notch! Consider it 100x better than what the Holiday Inn would serve you in a banquet! I wouldn't mind coming back to the MGM for a conference nor staying at the hotel. It's pretty decent if you're looking for something in the middle of the strip.

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

DATE TIP: Oui oui!

He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. "I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life."

"Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa." replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.

The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.

They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.

The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat.

"You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here." ther kid said, "but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa."

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

I'm a little perplexed as to how to write my review for Jerry Seinfeld's show at Caesar's Palace.  Reason being is that I won my 2 show tickets (along with my 2-night stay at the Octavius Tower) from KOST1035.  Free makes everything 5 stars!  I'll try to type something from the viewpoint of an actual paying customer.  Here goes-

Having not watched Seinfeld ever, even though it was part of NBC's "Must See TV" lineup,  I wasn't familiar with his style of comedy.  I've seen Jerry on TV every now & again, but nothing substantial to where I can form an opinion on him as a comedian.  

The Colosseum was the show location, the same place where Celine Dion performs.  I forgot the name of the opening act comedian (something Schmidt), but he killed.  I actually thought he was funnier than Jerry Seinfeld.  He made witty observations about subjects such as his mother, the 99 cent only stores and doctor's appointments.  He supposedly is a regular on "The Tonight Show", but I  haven't seen late night talk shows in a long, long time.  His set was short, but definitely wasn't filler.

Jerry himself also killed.  He made hilarious observations on relationships, marriage, kids, coffee and even restroom stalls.  He didn't resort to foul language or gross-out humor, which is a plus for me.  Shows more creativity.  I LOL'ed many, many times and felt great doing so.  After his set, he came back out & had a mini Q&A session.  Jerry was a class-act that evening.

I checked the price for tickets at Tix4Tonight when buying tickets for Donny & Marie, and they were being sold for $66.  For that price, I would recommend attending Jerry Seinfeld's show.  However for the regular $125+, I would pass.  I enjoy comedy, but not for that much money.  I'd rather see a musical act, Cirque du Soleil or impersonators for that money.  However, I did enjoy my evening and still have some of his one-liners in my head.

Excelsior!

A $19 cobb salad with a $3 PBR. Well, let's be real here...eventually we learned of buckets of PBR, six for $15. DEAL! SOLD! The cocktail list is lively, fresh and inventive and pricey as one would expect at a resort. 

We took shelter in our private cabana and had stellar service from AJ. We were served a fruit and veggie platter along with other things we ordered...nachos were delicious...as was my cobb salad.

The cabana was comfortable with a u shaped seating area with complimentary bottled water (well, complimentary my ass...it's part of the $200 that was paid for the cabana...but I digress) and of course plenty of clean, fresh towels. 

The entrance, the grounds, the main pool...everything just so vibrant, clean and utterly breathtaking. The crowd was so NOT douchey. It was a nice mix of old and young, gay and straight and black and white...you get the picture. We met a lot of fun people during our six hours there. 

Now. The best part. My friends, young as they are, were staying for happy hour. Well I had my limit of PBR's and had a Schnauzer in diapers waiting for her afternoon walk, so I decided to split. The concierge directed me to the bellman and said he would help me get a taxi. The bellman asked if a towncar would be ok? Um. Hmm. A pristine, shiny black town car or a roll of the dice with a skanked out taxi with a sweaty, hairy, stinky driver. Yes. Town car. 

It. Was. Perfect. I was sunburnt. Tipsy. And on my way home. The drive down the 51 is so beautiful. When he pulled into my driveway and said it was $29 (a deal!)...I gave him two twenties and thanked him. Cuz that's how I roll.

This review is long overdue! A friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for a pedicure so I called for an appointment and got placed with Tami. 

My experience was relaxing from start to finish. Tami (the owner) is very friendly and good at what she does. She had recently opened after years of working in the hotels doing luxury pedicures. She has brought her experience in that arena to the strip mall. If you're looking to be pampered with a high end spa quality pedicure without breaking the bank, this is your place! 

The pedicure that I had was amazing! The products that they use are high quality along with the heavenly smells... Let's just say I could get used to treating myself to a pedicure at the Mirror Mirror Salon on a regular basis. I really loved the fact that this salon uses hygienic liners in the bowls where you soak your feet. It's so important, I can't stress this enough! I contracted flesh eating bacteria at a high end nail salon in NYC and I could have lost my toe or worse. After that, I refuse to go anywhere that doesn't use them and finding places that do can be difficult. If I were you, I'd consider going to Mirror Mirror for that fact alone... 

Now as for the high quality products I was mentioning, I'll give you a little play by play. They use a callus softener on your feet followed by a brown sugar souffl scrub. Then comes the glycolic acid mask and healing foot mousse. After that I received one of the best foot massages ever with a rich, moisturizing body butter followed by their yummylicious vanilla paraffin wax.

I made sure I thanked my friend profusely for the gift certificate. I'll definitely return and I recommend checking out this salon. If you do, make sure to say hello to Tami for me. She's great!

While I was in Vegas and bored outta my mind, I called my "friend" Chris who moved to Vegas a few years ago so we could "chat".

I was staying at the Cosmo so I told him to meet me at the Vesper Bar so we could have a drink and he could possibly slip me a quaalude *kidding*

People watching here is amazing.  The bar area is pretty much empty most of the time, but there are so many people moving past from the hotel.  All kinds of walks of life, from everywhere.  

The drinks all have interesting names and even more interesting ingredients.  Drinks are average prices, anywhere from 10-15 bucks, but they're worth it.  The bartenders are nice, and easy on the eyes.  

If you happened to see an Asian guy making out with a tall white guy...That was probably me...God I'm such a slut, at least Chris cured my case of boredom.

While it's expensive and far from flawless, Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is the most unique venue I've ever been to. I can see people having a love/hate relationship here, but trust me, it's worth going just to find out which camp you belong to. 

As mentioned earlier, drink prices are absurd. $16 a drink, including beers. Yes, I bought my friend a $16 Stella. Gross. However, this isn't just a bar. There are a ton of roaming entertainers, including a a piano player, an 8-bit band(?), a burlesque dancer, tap dancers, magicians, a beatboxer, aerialists, etc. performing every 15 min or so. So you're paying for an overall experience, which is cool. I spoke to some diners about the performances and they all said they were welcome distractions and didn't take anything away from the meal. So there's that...

Take some time to explore the different rooms and all of their features. You'll find little quirky things all over the place. At midnight the venue opens up and there's a small show with many of the roaming performers. In the end, I dropped $100 on drinks, but was entertained thoroughly for 2.5 hours. Sure, that $$ could've bought a Cirque tik, but this is a totally different experience.  

Full disclosure: I didn't eat a thing nor did I see a ticketed performance (midnight show only).

Recognize the chef?  Bravo's Top Chef contestant, consulted for XXX, worked at world class YYY, Michelin Chef ZZZ says he's "the greatest thing since boiled chicken".  Celebrity chef or otherwise, food must speak for itself.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to "delicious but" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the "in season" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.

Seriously good  Japanese comfort food (robata grill) combined with outstanding artistry.

For starters, agedashi tofu.  Sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.

From the robata grill, Kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), "Kobe" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), "Kobe" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).

Finally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  They feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  Some of the dishes are out there.  One night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  Both surprisingly delicious.  Keep an open mind.  The progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  Well worth the $100 or $150.  

Note:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.

Tip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  Depending on how much they "like" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an Asian thing).

Good selection of sake at all quality and price levels. 

Needless to say, highly recommended.

Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out. 

Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room.

Maybe it was just an off night but I'd have to agree to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this place. I think people might be fans because of the HUGE wraps. I saw them making one and I was amazed at the portion size! But lots of food ain't my style... especially if it is lots of crappy food! Tasted both of the shawarmas and they were drier than the Sahara desert plus gristle. Adding tons of tzatziki couldn't even save my meal. Their food didn't seem fresh to me at all, which is one of their selling points on their website. Either things have gone downhill, or it just wasn't in the cards for me tonight. I was really disappointed with their food and what I ordered. I really wanted to like Parsley Mediterranean Grill since it's local and I heard good things but I probably won't be back. The extra star is for the service and the chocolate dessert as both of those were good.

Another awesome Cirque du Soleil show.  This one features acrobatic performers and water.  I'm always amazed at how they can pull off all of these moves in such an elegant and choreographed way.  My hat's off to the performers!

I don't want to give away too much, but this show will simply amaze you.  It's worth seeing more than once.  There's no way I can keep my eye on everything going on.  Every time I see this show I see something different.

Definitely worth the time and money while you're in Vegas.  When out of town visitors ask me what show to see when they're in Vegas, I mention this one as one of the Top 5 in town.

Will I return?  Can't wait for the next time!

It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.

Yes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.

Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.

However, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.

As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.

While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.

i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp. 

so i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty, sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(

carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it. 

price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill "mexican food"

I've stayed at Mandalay Bay twice and been to shows, dinner, or gamble several times and it is a solid 4-stars ... a notch below the elite of Vegas and a step above the mediocre. It's large with the full Vegas experience under one roof if you aren't wanting to explore ... with multiple pools, a plethora of restaurants, the Michael Jackson show, other concerts, standard shopping, and, of course, a casino. Resort is a better name for Mandalay Bay than hotel.

The rooms aren't elite opulence, but they are nice with functional, yet cozy furniture and large bathrooms. If you can afford it, be sure to upgrade to one of the upper floors because the views of the Las Vegas Strip are better from there. Since Mandalay Bay is currently near the South end of the Strip, rooms with a view facing north/east will be the best. The location is also really close to the airport and 15 freeway.

Overall, Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is a solid option when visiting Vegas. If you get a good deal on a room or are looking for a one-stop shop for a large group with diverse needs then I definitely recommend Mandalay Bay.

"My eyes adored you,
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you.
Like a million miles away from me,
you couldn't see,
How I adored you.
So close, so close and yet so far." - "My Eyes Adored You", Frankie Vallie & the 4 Seasons

I loved "Jersey Boys"!!  The musical retelling of how the group last known as "The 4 Seasons" came to be, starting at the humble beginnings of standing underneath a streetlamp in New Jersey.  I'm a big fan of Franki Valli's music & getting to see how he became the multimillion selling, international hit singer had me hooked from the moment the lights came on.

The actor who portrayed Frankie Valli was dynamite!!!.  He hit those high notes like a champ.  To me, he resembled the Brazilian race car driver, Helio Castroneves.  The supporting cast also did a magnificent job during the show.  We had primo seats, 5 rows from the stage, in Row D.  Looking around, all the seats seem to have a good view, but I must say I loved my vantage point.  

FYI, there is typical "Jersey talk" used during the show, aka profanity, & there is also some gun action/blood.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend taking the little ones.  There is an 8 minute intermission with a handy countdown timer displayed on the stage, for those wanting to make sure they get back just in time.

I defy anyone not to sing along & have the catchy songs of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons in their head for the rest of the night & the day after, as well.  I immensely enjoyed "Jersey Boys" at Paris Las Vegas from beginning to end.

I highly recommend you come & catch a performance of one of the greatest shows on The Strip!

Seriously? Girls, think 2x before coming here. Yes what the other reviewers said "Do yourself a favor and just go to XS" 

Depending on the event at the hotel, the place will conform. If it's a fight weekend expect to see ghetto ass people and rowdy people. The place was jam packed and not nice as the other clubs. We went on a fight weekend and the place was filthy, dirty, and gross. Lots of ghetto people (and cheap!) Not a place you want to be at. After the fight we heard many fights broke out (luckily we were at XS! Woot!)

Also, they don't do specials like other clubs like girls free drink from 10-11 or 2 free drink coupons, and they don't even serve water, you have to BUY a small small Fuji water for $9. No water in a regular glass? That sounds like a bad situation since that will lead to over consumption and by over drinking you get a rowdy crowd and then John Taffer will come and yell at you for letting your guest over drink. I know they want to make money, but with the expensive drinks, is a cup of water that hard to ask for? What if you're friend is totally wasted and that cup of water will save her life, and you just wasted all your money buying their expensive drink. Other clubs will provide you like a plastic cup of water, nope not Hakkasan because they want you to be drunk and rowdy, ghetto and get into fights. I guess it's publicity for them. 

Reeally people, do yourself a favor-go to one of the BETTER clubs (XS, Tao, Marquee, etc). You're welcome or I told you so.... hahaha.

So as 4 of us were waiting in line to buy tickets at 9:15pm on a Sunday, a random, friendly girl gave us three tickets and in a flash she was gone.  We were in total disbelief.  I was still skeptical up to the part where they scanned the ticket.  Saved us $111!!  I owe her some Sprinkles at the very least if we ever cross paths again.  

Currently the largest observatory wheel in the world (wonder how much of a pain it will be when it becomes the 2nd), there's not much to say about the ride itself.  You go around for 30 minutes, see the strip, snap pics and it's over.  The waiting area before getting to the actual wheel is very Disney Worldesque.  

The "guide" is a guy on a video screen dishing out facts and bad jokes (420 ft! You're really high!!).   I wonder why they didn't have different performers from Caesars shows doing video segments instead?  Imagine what the Gazillionaire and Penny would say?!  They could do the "quiet tour" with Teller.

The biggest variable with how enjoyable your ride will be are the others in your pod.  Each pod is supposed to fit 40 people.  I saw a family with 5 small and loud kids on their rollerskate sneakers in front of us and I would have done almost anything to avoid being in the same pod including lighting myself on fire.  We rode with about 20 others that were fine and excited to be on the ride.  

Other things:

- Try to go for the seats on the immediate right upon getting into the pod.
- Nighttime has to be better than daytime.  
- Please go to the restroom before getting on.

SCUM BAGS! I wish i could give negative stars. came in here for them to fix my AC in my Mercedes since it all of a sudden just stopped working. The guy behind the counter told me he had put a ultra violet wash through my AC to see where it was leaking. That was 82$ My AC worked for about 4 days and once again went out. So i brought it back and the guy (at the same location) told me they couldn't see where it was leaking from. He started using his "mechanic talk" and told me he could fix it. 162$ later i paid in cash and it just so happened their printer wasn't working so i couldn't get a receipt. Then as i was leaving the other guy behind the counter (skinny, shorter) asked me if i had weed in my car. I said No and he said "Damn i was going to ask if i could buy some from you" uhhh WTF! 
And once again, my AC went out 3 days later. I ended up going to a different mechanic and told them about the UV flush. This mechanic took me into the shop and put up a black light and no trace of UV was seen. He ended up putting the flush through my car and 2 weeks later i took it back and he put the black light up again, you could clearly see the neon residue everywhere and where it was leaking.
I called the Big O Tires and spoke to a manager. I told him about what happened & he said there was nothing in the computer about me coming in the 2nd time, or paying any money. He also said their wasn't anything in my file about a UV flush. I felt so cheated and deceived. I really hope this review gets out there and lets everyone know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

In my previous life in education, I heard so much about changing our ideas--our culture--and I always thought it was so much happy horse shit! When I read Tony Hsieh's book "Delivering Happiness" and I saw the word culture so much, it gave me dja vu all over again.  (Thanks Yogi)  After my tour of Zappos today, I get it and how it works for this company.  

You sign up online for the tour.  Parking is in the Zappos' garage off Las Vegas Boulevard before Stewart.  You go to the second floor, sign in with the person in the lobby, and wait for your tour.  You're given an ID badge and a name tag.  Several culture reps divide the group and take you to see Zappos at work.  My culture person was Rene and she was a gem!  She was always happy to be asked a question and she had the answers for us.

We saw some of the call center, the culture section where employees were dealing with customers either online or on the phone.  We got to see the Z Caf and the employee patio.

I am sure that the employees are not always smiling and not always happy, but I did see a whole bunch of people who seemed to be happily doing their jobs in a relaxed, informal setting and the idea of culture that Mr. Hsieh has been so focused on works!

The tour lasts just about an hour.  You are free to bring your camera and take photos.  The only thing they ask is that you don't take photos of computer screens (it might have customer information on it or other things that should remain private) and they ask that there be no video.

This is a tour that would be interesting for anyone to take.  It's amazing to see what they did to the old Las Vegas City Hall.

This marathon has gotten a bad rap. 

I have many friends & co-workers who have run the Rock n' Roll marathons in other cities. Most of them would probably unanimously agree that the Vegas is the one of the worst. Their opinions are ones I trust. 

This was my 3rd year running the half. Is it chaotic? Yes. Disorganized? Expensive entry? Yep. Would I run it again? Absolutely. So if it's so bad, why am I giving it 4 stars? It's just that fun!

When I read the other reviews to see what most people hated, don't get me wrong, they are legitimate complaints. What's my biggest suggestion if you're reading this, thinking of running it for the first time or trying it again next year? READ THE EMAIL. They send runners a final informational email to explain everything, showing maps of where to park to explaining where families can reunite with the marathoners they finish. Is everything strictly enforced, like the corralling? No. Do they have the best course support? Probably not. But a lot of the headaches can be avoided by reading your email and planning ahead. If you race, you know - something always unexpected happens on Race Day!

There's nothing like running down the Strip at night. I'm going to run other cities in the future and enjoy it for what they offer. This is what we offer and I just appreciate that we can hold something so unique. It's one of many things that makes Vegas... VEGAS!  That's just me, take it for what it's worth. I have fun and if you run it, you can make it a blast, too!

Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.

From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)

Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*

Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

There's nothing else like this in Las Vegas and you should go now because who knows if they'll be able to sustain the air of coolness (hope!) it has once everyone knows.  If you combined the whole craft cocktail scene that's emerged in the last few years, off kilter shows like "Absinthe", the lurking human oddity stuff that's popped up at some club spots and the fucking jadedness to the $3k bottle service/fist pump crowd, Rose.Rabbit.Lie is like a culmination of all of this and seems so right for right now.  It's really refreshing!  There was also this whole underlying "Eyes Wide Shut" feel to the whole thing in a good way.   

Thanks to Edwin P, my wife and I were able see the 8pm show of "Vegas Nocturne".  I won't go into any details of the show but I thought it was terrific.  This is what I imagine vaudeville shows were like but with some added modern nuances.  If you liked Absinthe, you will like this.    

We hung out for a while in their "music room" which was fantastic.  I am not sure what genre to technically call the band but it was like an old school New Orleans band with horns playing modern hits.  One of the funniest performers in "Vegas Nocturne" belted out a psycho version of "Blurred Lines" that had everyone on their feet.  There were some really unique performers after her too.  

I had a chance to look at the dinner menu which looked great.  We definitely plan on doing that soon.  Caviar tacos, foie gras, steak and some really interesting dishes I fail to remember due to the cocktails.  Can't wait to go back!

FEZ is poshy and obnoxious, like the restaurants on Santana Row. Yet it was surprisingly inviting, mostly due to our awesome server.

We came here for late dinner. Our server was nice enough to extend the happy hour menu to us at the table since the bar was packed and we really wanted the bar bites!

Cheese fondue (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg?select=s-DoCgOwLo0-XoDuIhfBGA): Big portion. The cheese was gooey and delicious! The combination of grilled zucchini and cheese was surprisingly tasty! We loved it!

Deep fried poppers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg?select=rsusUomr1--LF_3qE3EN2A): I was quite intrigued by how perfectly round the poppers were. Sweet red peppers filled with cream cheese. A bit disappointed since they weren't spicy. The aioli did add a kick though.

Love happy hours! Especially late night! =D

Booked the Penthouse and all i can say is....WOW!!!!

The panoramic view of the strip from the corner Penthouse was breathtaking and the spacious rooms were elegant, modern & clean.  The beds you ask? Nice and firm, just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol
Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily "turn down" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.
If you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence, this just might be your ticket to paradise.

Happy Times!

We stayed here a couple of months ago for our Vegas Getaway because we heard good things.

It is generally a good hotel casino off the strip about 10 minutes drive from the strip.  The property is huge!  They have a bowling alley and movie theatre in the building.  They have a good variety of restaurants.  We got to try Steak & Shake which was really good cheap eats.

The room was very spacious and clean.  We had no problems with the room.  The bathroom was huge & had a great shower.  The bed was very comfortable.  We got a pretty good deal on our rooms to boot.

One thing to note was there were lots of older folks at this hotel.  Not your typical Vegas hotel.

They have self & valet parking.  We normally parked ourselves in the front parking facing the hotel.

1990's this place was the best club around.  Now it's the worst. I mean sure there are a few boobies to look at but that's about it.  

The girls don't talk to anyone and ask if you want a table dance.  I checked around the room a few times and other than the three dancers on the three stages THERE WERE NO OTHER GIRLS TO BE SEEN IN THE PLACE, (well other than the ones in our party, but they weren't dancing).

We tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers, and nothing.  We tried to make it rain money on the dancers and told them to come back and nothing!  This was a "busy" Saturday night so you would think the dancers would on their A game, but nothing. 

If I'm gonna go to a titty bar I at least want that stripper perfume sent on me next time!  I going to check out Band-Aids next time

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

So if you feel like this is a place you would like to try out after reading this, by all means take your chances.

500 or 900 degrees.  60 or 180 seconds.  Yup, great Italian style pizza.

The pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.

Tried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive "stuff" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).

It's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect "octopussy" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).

The mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.

50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  

Bottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

Buying a Westgate timeshare was the biggest mistake I've ever made. Every other bad choice in my life has at least ended up leading me somewhere better or helped me to become a better person down the road, but not the timeshare. This bad decision sucked a ton of money out of me and continues to do so for maintenance and taxes every year, and I haven't gotten ANYTHING out of it except for years worth of scam artists cold-calling me to get MORE money out of me to supposedly sell it - a scam that probably works a lot with Westgate owners because having this $#@! timeshare is such a MISERABLE experience. EVERY time I have tried to use my timeshare, there has been something new pop out of the woodwork. "Oh sorry, that resort will be an extra $1000 fee because it's ski season." "Oh sorry, that resort, and that one, and that one, and yes, those other ones, are all full." "Oh sorry, there's a new rule at Planet Hollywood now where you have to bank your week by September 30th of the previous year or it's gone until 2014. Yes, we know that Westgate used to allow you to use it in off-years, but we're Hilton now. Tough luck." 

We were promised easy booking, plenty of availability, lots of choices for resorts, a big grand opening party when PH opened... nothing. I've had none of that. The timeshare presentation was smoke and mirrors, and now I own a worthless so-called "vacation" package I have not been able to actually use ONCE in 4 years. And I've been paying over $650 in taxes every year for the privilege of NOT actually going on vacation.

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT let these scam artists suck you in. If only I had read reviews before signing that paper. If only.

Okay, I have a some rules. 

Fast food places cannot earn Four Stars. My logic is somewhat simple and straight forward; it's  due to their uniformity and universal blandness. How can one Mickey D's, be better than another or differentiated?  Close you eyes and tell me where you are. Try it sometimes. 

That said, this one is real close to being Four Stars. The folks behind the counter, Patti and Maria in particular are all very nice. They will go out of their for you and seem to really like their jobs.  Wow

I come here a couple of mornings each week, not for the Egg McMuffin or Big Breakfast; but to order two egg whites. That's right, egg whites. They're only $0.98 each, and they'll allow you to substitute them on any sandwich for free. Throw in a coffee and you'll be out the door for less than four bucks. Nice!

It UR on a diet, or just want to eat healthier, I would highly recommend it.  So "A-Okay", bordering on "yes, I'm a Fan"

Oh how I love wine country... and now, thanks to Oakville Grocery, we've got our own little taste of wine country right here in the Valley!

While I anxiously anticipated the opening of this unique little gem, I finally made it in for a visit over the weekend... and there isn't too much more to add than what Aimee and Linda already wrote.  (Those bitches beat me to the punch!)

While I went in just to get a drink and check it out, I wanted to yelp about it sooner than later so more people will know about this recently opened grocery.  I can say, without a doubt that I'll be back soon.  One visit to this place is not enough.  Their salads and sandwiches look fresh and delicious, their pizza and prepared foods do too.  I love their espresso bar area and especially that they carry Julia Baker Confections.  Whether you're looking for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, a snack or a full meal, to dine in or to take out, this place has something for you.

While I'd much rather transport myself to the original Oakville Grocery in Napa Valley, I'll settle for Scottsdale Quarter in the meantime.  Cheers!

In every city, usually across the street or within a short walk of the High School there is a neighborhood hangout. 

The food can run from just average, to exceptional. Elmer's tends to be mostly in the latter camp over the former, what a wonderful surprise.

My two coworkers and I came here for a late lunch yesterday. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Heck, even on the inside it doesn't either. 

Yes, Elmer's is a hole in the wall type place. One that probably wouldn't even make Guy Fieri's DDD list. But the food is good.

I ordered chips, steak burrito and a drink. The tab came to under $9 and if you look at the picture of the chips, it's kind of basic. The Salsa btw comes in plastic squirt bottles. LOL. 

But my steak burrito was the real deal and bomb! Take a look at my picture and know that Chipotle has nothing on this bad boy. It tasted as good as it looks and it's only $5.85.  Nice. 

Enjoy!

Back in 1999, Kenny Guinn declared this part of Spring Mountain as "China Town" because apparently all Asians in Clark County are Chinese. Sure, you can argue that all Asian people did originate from the Chinese, but thats not the point. 

The Chinatown Plaza was the very first China themed mall in Chinatown. And today the Chinese community of Las Vegas is very honored that the most famous resident of Chinatown is Floyd Mayweather.

This shopping center has a Filipino Restaurant, a couple of Pho places, a ton of Korean restaurants, and a huge shopping mall to buy Chinese gifts and Beckoning Cats. Like only 30% of this shopping center actually features Chinese businesses.

Remember that Chinese food has a 5000 year history. So that's why so many of our favorite Japanese and Korean dishes look so similar. Every other Asian country stole their cuisine from China. A lot of you know that Ramen originated in China, but did you know that Sushi also originated in China  as well?

Most of us use this shopping center as a place to park because the shopping center with Ichiza, Yagyu Yakiniku, and Anime Ramen has no parking spaces. I've never been towed, but recently they hired this gigantic Native-American parking enforcer who looks f*cking scary!

When I first moved to Las Vegas, I immediately noticed that all the different ethnic groups of Asian people hated each other. There was a gigantic and vicious inter-Asian rivalry going on. I didn't like this one bit because as a young child, I grew up in Arcadia, where one of the most brutal concentration camps for Japanese-Americans once existed. As a child I remember seeing Chinese-Americans get told to "go back to Japan". During the LA Riots, many African-Americans in the area used to say racial slurs to Chinese-Americans, telling them to go back to Korea. My point here is that we as Asian-Americans all had to suffer together because they just don't care what specific type of Asian we are. Vincent Chin made this argument a fact when he was murdered.  

The very first documented Asian-American was actually Filipino. But, the very first large migration of Asian-Americans were Chinese. They paved the way for all the rest of us. Since they first set foot in the United States, they were hated and vilified for no reason at all.  In the 1850s,  a legislative was passed that made Chinese men unable to testify in court, in 1862 California residents voted that all Chinese residents should be taxed for being Chinese, 1878 the United States Government revoked every Chinese immigrants citizenship as Americans even if they were born in the USA, they were also prohibited from getting married, and in California it was NOT illegal to assault a Chinese man, in 1882 all Chinese immigrants are banned from entering the USA. Most of these laws were not repealed until the 1940s!! 

Frequently, I walk around in Chinatown and see a "westerner"acting completely disrespectful and making racist jokes towards every little Chinese decoration in the plaza.  The reason they do this is because the Chinese people are too polite to them and allow them to do this. These "westerners" should thank God everyday that they didn't do that in a Vietnamese district like Westminster California, because I guarantee that some Vietnamese guy would have beaten the living crap out of them, abducted them, and brought them to the backroom of a Pho restaurant and force them to play Russian Roulette. Yeah, it's called "Russian" Roulette, but the Vietnamese are the only people who are Man enough to play it. 

All I ask, is that you treat the Chinese with some respect when you come here. You don't see Chinese people  come into stores like "EXTREME John Smith's HARDCORE Dirt bikes, Surfboards, and Skate Shop" and disrespect you guys.

"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today."  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys.

"OK, OK, where we going?"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining.

"Oyster Bar.  Palace Station." is all he says.

"Cool".  Leaning towards my buds, "Did we really feed him fish sperm?"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.

Very Important:

1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait.
2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.

That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.

Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.

Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.

Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.

The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)

Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!

Here's how my experience went ... 

Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?" 
Employee: "No"
.... dead air ...
Me: "Ummm why not?"
Employee: "We don't have carmel"
Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"
Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"
Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

---- 
please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ... 
----
Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!

"The perfect lover is one who turns into a pizza at 4:00 a.m."  - Charles Pierce

One fateful night after a long grueling ten-hour shift, the ladies who work next door decided that we were going to grab some pizza and wings and complain relentlessly about working in customer service.  Pizza, wings, and a bitch-fest?  I'm down!

Being that I'm not from the Avondale area, I never would have came across this place if it wasn't for my ladies.  We have invaded Brother's time-and-time again for years and we always get the same large pizza and wings special they have.  Wings are always lip-smacking delicious and the pizza is gigantic and oozing with cheese and grease.  The crust isn't strong enough to hold their generous amounts of toppings and is pretty flavorless by itself but we can always toss away the crust, right?  It's the kind of comfort food you need after a day of dealing with ignorant and difficult people.  One bite from this place I don't like:  the canoli.  Then again, I'm not crazy for canolis so what do I know?

Brother's isn't a glamorous establishment by any means.  It's brightly lit, there are multiple televisions with sports on, the tables and booths are strong and sturdy, and there's a semi-sporty theme going on.  It's definitely not a romantic date spot but hey, you can grab a beer and catch a game while eating some cheap eats!

I want to warn everyone out there to NOT use this bakery for any special event!! I ordered 100 cupcakes for my recent wedding and confirmed my order (including the remainder of payment) with Slade, the owner, one week before. Slade assured me that although he would be out of town on the day of my event, my cupcakes would be delivered to the wedding site the morning of the ceremony/reception. On the day of the wedding, however, there were no cupcakes! They never showed up. According to a bakery employee (the day after the event), the person responsible for bringing them did not have a key to get into the bakery, as the locks had recently been changed. I can understand that these things happen, but what really upset were two things... 1)no one from the bakery bothered to call us or even the location where the wedding was held to help problem solve a new dessert; we were left on our own to scramble at the last minute. 2)I had to call Slade (when I returned from my honeymoon to NO message from him and NO refund of my money as of yet) to insist upon my money back. And, to add insult to injury, NOT ONCE did he ever even apologize or attempt to express even the slightest tone of remorse for the troubles his business caused us on my wedding day. If anything, he sounded taken aback that I was upset and put-out at my insistence that the money be refunded that day. I have never dealt with anyone who so blatantly cared less about his customers! I repeat... DO NOT USE THE WICKED WITCH BAKERY FOR ANY SPECIAL EVENT! 

One additional note... I called Slade back on Thursday (10/30) as no credit had yet showed pending on my account. He informed me that he had not put it through on Tuesday (as he had promised) but had "just done it this (Thurs) morning." When I stated that I was perturbed that he had not found it a priority to refund my $$ for services that his business did not provide, he became defensive and nasty once again and basically hung up on me! He called me back about an hour later (all nice and sweet this time) giving me the credit invoice numbers and told me that he "had just put them through." Sooo... not only did he not bother to refund my money the first time as promised, but then he lied to me about having done it Thursday morning before my call. This man can not be trusted!! I don't know about the rest of you Yelpers, but I think business integrity is more important than cupcake taste. I plan to stay faaaaaaaaaaar away from the Wicked Bakery.

5 Stars for the intimate Study Bar Alone... the best craft cocktails in Vegas!...yes that's a bold statement...Still, the rest of RRL is on point as well!

rose. rabbit. lie. is the latest happening at The Cosmopolitan.

It is billed as a "rebirth of the social club" and a "grand social experiment."  so, there you go...I'm sure that explains it perfectly.  Essentially what they have done is broken down the walls (some of them anyway) between typically separate venues like a restaurant, club, cocktail bar, and a live entertainment theater and brought them together in one spot.  The club doesn't start until after the last show, the restaurant is semipermeably divided from the entertainment, but the interplay creates a unique experience for sure.  There are several bars in the space as well--including one sensational place for quintessential cocktails...The Study...

The Study...  This niche bar is a small secluded treasure inside of rose. rabbit. lie.  They offer well-crafted, often boozy, but always balanced cocktails.  The Study serves up many classically inspired drinks as well as offering several modern variations.  The staff is staff here is elite and will work off the menu to delightful results as well.  The drinks start around $16 and are worth the price.

Nocturne is the show at RRL.  It is a whimsical interplay of circus acts...wait...or is it side show acts?...you'll have to find your way into the Cloak Room to know for show.  The shows are different at each time slot, but similar in concept.  I found the 8pm & 10pm shows to playfully fun and amusingly cheesy.  The individual acts range from tap dancers to contortionist; tight wire to burlesque; balance acts to aerial ropes.  In the same way that Coldplay is Radiohead Light, Nocturne is Absinthe Light.  Great in it's own right, but falling short to purists of the original.

Hubby and I decided to stop here to have a drink and share a dessert after having dinner somewhere else. I have really wanted to try this place for a while, but it was not what I had hoped. I ordered a "Banana Mango Margarita" priced at $16 and it came garnished with a few banana gummies. The drink tasted good and I liked the banana sugar that rimmed the drink, but the banana gummies were so rock hard that they couldn't be eaten. Bummer. Hubby ordered a "Reese's Martini" also priced at $16 and it was rimmed with peanut butter. I tried a couple drinks and thought it looked much better than it tasted. 

We ordered the "Sugar Factory Fondue" priced at $21.95 and was disappointed. You can choose white, milk or dark chocolate and we decided to go with the milk chocolate fondue. It came with gummy bears, homemade marshmallows, white chocolate bread, brownie bites, strawberries and bananas. The gummy bears were so hard like the banana gummies that we didn't bother with them. The homemade marshmallows and strawberries and bananas were actually good, but the bread and brownie bites were dry and bland. 

We sat near a window so the Bellagio water show made for a nice view. Our server was nice, but our total including tax was $60.86 and that is just way too much for 2 cocktails and 1 dessert that were nothing special. I came, I tried, I doubt I will be back if I am picking where to eat.

Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.

Everything from my previous review no longer applies.  Except for my tips about carrying a camera and a small plastic bag for food and water at the finish.  In 2010, when I wrote my first review, the race was limited to 28,000 runners.  It was crowded but not too horrific.  This year, Las Vegas and the race organizers apparently got greedy and allowed 44,000 runners to enroll.  That is way too much.  Next year, they want to have 60,000 runners.  Not a good idea.  In the interest of being concise, here were the problems with the 2011 race and why I will not run this again unless they get the number back down to 28,000:

1. The race organizers listed on the website that runners and spectators could park at the Luxor or Excalibur.  But apparently, they failed to clear that with the casinos and the casinos would not let us in.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.

2. The marathon started 1.5 hours before the half marathon and went out in the neighborhoods surrounding Mandalay Bay.  So when the marathon runners hit the strip after running the first 13 miles, unless they were extremely fast, they ran right into a wall of much slower half marathon runners.  That just sucks.

3. It took forever to get out of the finish line corral area because it was backed up for pictures.  Just mug shots of the runners.  Nothing fun like pictures with showgirls like last year.

4.  It took us over an hour to just get out of Mandalay Bay.  This is just walking out of the casino and does not include walking to the car, traffic, etc.  Mandalay Bay and/or the race organizers got the bright idea to schedule all this during National Final Rodeo and the opening weekend for Michael Jackson's The Immortal World Tour.  Piss poor planning all around.

It's a real bummer that I can't do this race again.  I've been doing the half marathon ever since it has been on the Strip and I wanted to continue the tradition.  But unless the race organizers place the cap at something reasonable, I can't do it anymore.

Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it in dew
Cover it in chocolate 
and a miracle or two?

Smeeks!

Let me get this out of the way. There are two things that Smeeks is missing: A bike rack and Sammy Davis Jr.  The first should really be unforgiveable, especially for a hipster, indie, shopping mecca such as this corner is, but I will distribute blame to all of the shops and take in to consideration that they let me park my bike inside for a recent writing workshop I attended there and let it slide this once. As for item number two...well since he died of throat cancer in 1990 we will let that one go as well.

I went for a writing workshop after hours, last night. The workshop was based on writing about memories and they had a table loaded with chocolates, gummies, malt balls, candy cigarettes, button candy, any kind of treat to spur sweet memories so I had a chance to sample a wide variety of goods.

I have also been in to Smeeks several times on my own so this review is by no means based solely on a candy catered, one-night, sugar-rush.

Smeeks is adorable, it's charming, it's old-school but not geriatric. If personified it would be that fun yet classy older lady who you are surprised to find yourself fantasizing about.

My sweet tooth took over last night; it became Hyde to my dieting Jekyll, but "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." so I gave in to temptation. I let my fingers gently grip ball after ball of smooth, thick chocolate covering the light crunch of malt. I tongued the candy cigarettes and let one dangle from my mouth doing my best James Dean pout. I sucked the chocolate from chocolate covered marshmallows followed by the sensation of the sugary delight disolving in my mouth. I was a kid in a candy store.

Smeeks is full of the hard to find. Each member of the group last night and each person i have ever entered the store with has found a candy that made them light up with recognition as they  rattled on about whatever childhood memory it had spurred, despite the fact I have never heard of most of them.

Let us not forget the novelties. Small toys, trinkets and a wall of bacon products. Not flavored, more of a wall for the worshipers of bacon. i wallet made to look like it is made from bacon, bacon magnets, notepads, bacon everything.

Based on early reviews it sounds like Smeeks got a rough start, but as Yelpers we have to love a place that does it right; a place that takes the issues of the people and listens then in turn improving until they are the 5 star establishment that they are today.

This show is far and away the catchiest, most innovative and hypnotic stage show I have ever seen.  Whether you are a fan of The Beatles or not this show is a MUST SEE in my opinion.  

The Mirage is home to the spectacle that is LOVE and by having this show performed in the round is absolutely brilliant.  The round stage offers a remarkably good view to all guests no matter what seat you purchase (although their is one minor interactive element exclusive to those who sit closer during the show but I wont spoil it).  The music is prefect and covers songs throughout the entire Beatles catalog of music and the story flows seamlessly throughout.  For those saying this has less high gravity and death defying acts than your normal Cirque du Soleil show is fair perhaps but the show definitely still deliver in this aspect as well.  There is so much going on at one time it is sometimes hard to keep up with it all and you go into overload mode but in a good way.

The Beatles have had such an impact on many peoples lives in one way, shape or form and for me their music resonates big time in me and is often playing loudly in my head.  I enjoyed the entire show but the several of the scenes such as Hey Jude and Lucy in the Sky really stood out above some of the rest.  The show will take you through the entire gambit of emotions as you embark on the roller coaster ride that is this show.  You will feel the happiness and joy that many songs convey one second while being brought back down into a more somber, melodic and melancholy feel the next.  The show moves at a breakneck pace but never fails to keep you thinking and watching at every turn.  

The special effects and props used were done to absolute perfection and really have to be seen firsthand to be believed.  They did an excellent job of weaving in world events and other periods of Beatlemania into the story which really gave the show a complete feel.  The Beatles are one of those bands who like them or not whose music will be around forever and will continue to resonate with people in different ways.  They truly were a once in a lifetime band that will love on forever and this show is a perfect homage to them.  If you are in Vegas and looking for a show this would definitely top my list.  Beatles and non Beatles fans alike will fall in LOVE with this show (pun intended).

I was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at 630am to drive and pick up my Bountiful Basket from Ahwatukee. To help offset the sleep, I decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee, Dunkin Donuts.

As I walked back to my filthy, dusty car, I got the overwhelming desire to wash it. Now, folks, on the rare occasions when I want nothing more than to clean my car or house, I try to monopolize on the opportunity, so I drove around to three different car washes in an attempt to get my baby cleaned... but as luck would have it, not one god damned place was open.

Just when my will to live was seconds away from being squashed, I suddenly remembered that there was a Groupon special a week ago for Clean Freak, and I felt like it was a moment of Nachos (see Dallas G.) so I decided to see if the Nachos Gods were on my side this day.

Well guess what, Clean Freak was open! And I was excited because that big blue tunnel was just fascinating! And what is this? $10 for the most pricey wash that cleans my tires too?? AND air freshener?? SCORE!!! And to boot, the cashier dude was in holiday spirit wearing his Halloween costume!

Now, here comes this crappy part... the wash really wasn't that good. My windows weren't clean and there was still grime all over my tires. I had to buy window cleaner. None of the dead bugs came off my grill, either.

Oh.... and the vacuum's... I honestly believe that they could have sucked an unborn child from my womb had I been carrying one. But instead it got one of the many pieces of my stereo console. I'm sure that is going to cost me good money to replace. Thanks.

Next time I have to make such an effort to get my car washed, I will just live like a filthy slob until I can find time to make it over to Danny's Family. It may cost $25 but at least my car is clean and I don't have to worry about losing my uterus.

The lovely Sarah G decided to bless me w her awesome presence for lunch this afternoon. I am so glad we decided on this lovely House of Tricks! Does anyone know why its called that?!?! I'm curious please tell me??!?! Soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow. A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?! 

The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker?? 

I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?

"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."   Yogi Berra

Nothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.

I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.

An all American steakhouse.  No Australian Wagyu.  No A5 Japanese beef.  Just USDA Prime Nebraska corn feed beef and American comfort food sides that bring out the best in the beef's flavor.

Rule one:  Stick to land.  Visit it's sister restaurant, Lakeside for well prepared seafood.  This is a steakhouse.

For starters, classic foie.  Served incredible thick cut, beautifully seared with slivers of apple, apple puree, tart huckleberries and vegetal celery leaves.  Beautiful balance. Pure decadence.  The charred steak tartare with the classic Worcestershire, Dijon, chives and crumbled egg is equally good.  The slight addition of the heat tightens up some of the beef and releases it's beef flavor.  Good texture and another flavor dimension.

To the steaks.  USDA prime, well aged, extremely well trimmed.  All steaks cooked to temperature, juicy and tender.  Top props to the 28 day, dry aged tomahawk.  Complex, nutty, slightly bleu cheese flavor of the dry aging and deep beefy goodness near the bone.  Win!   The porterhouse for two, the best way to enjoy both the filet mignon and the NY strip.  Less complex flavor but a steak lover's steak.  Once again, excellent beef flavor nearest the bone.

A well made variety of sauces are offered that enrich or brighten the steaks but then again, why rob yourself of the great American beef flavor?

Sides are very well conceived.  They enhancing the smoky, umame characteristics of the beef.  Top props to a great late season creamed corn topped with shaved black truffle.  Sets off all kinds of earthy fireworks when paired with the beef.  Sauted wild mushrooms (enhance umame) and grilled jumbo asparagus with the hint of vibrant lemon juice (contrasting flavor enhancing the beefs natural sweetness) all great choices.

Service is steakhouse familiar and efficient.

Excellent wine list. Good vintage depth.  New world emphasis.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Consistent.  Several repeat visits (thanks to the Wynn Classic tourney).  An American steakhouse that hits the mark.

UPGRADE TO THE TOWER ROOMS!!!

if ur main goal in vegas is to eat eat eat, sleep sleep sleep, gamble and more eating, your room might not be of the most importance if your budget is ruled mainly by eating good food. For me: I just wanted a decent place to stay, close to the City Center, without spending a fortune on a room, that i would just use to sleep and shower. We took advantage of booking early to a discount and I spent about $230.00 for a fri-mon stay. The upgrade says Widescreen TV, but we didn't really care about that- the main difference from the other rooms is that it looks a little more modern. Beds were decent and comfortable : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=hEzxVsEJzj4_Bdm1CJoQFQ
Bathrooms were clean. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=ez1T5FamJ8MzAvyp94Zueg
I have crashed in some pretty ugly looking hotel rooms in vegas, and for the price and convenience, it was pretty decent! 
Check in was smooth, signing up for the Mlife playing card was a breeze since i registered ahead online, staff was friendly, but slots were not. 
They have a convenient food court http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=mvxEq1vTcSsHPYC5Kzwrnw.
There's always Thunder From Down Under (been twice for bachelorette parties!)- which is pretty decent too!

***update***
Our original posting was deleted by Yelp. Now this posting went from being "recommended" to currently hidden at the bottom of the "not recommended" reviews... So far, 21 users thought it was useful. Why are you hiding my review, Yelp? Could it be because I gave a NEGATIVE review based on my OWN experience? So much for being able to trust your site for unbiased reviews.
*********

Our previous review was deleted by Yelp for "violating their guidelines" so I'll post another review that only relates to our personal experience with their boarding facility.

We used Green Acre Boarding in Oct of 2013 for a 3 night stay. This place was presented as a great place for dogs... Free roam and lots of kids to play with your pups.  

This seemed like a great scenario for our 1yr old golden but our 11 year old sheltie just needed a safe place to stay. When I dropped our dogs off, I told MaLeisa that our sheltie didn't enjoy playing with other dogs (she would run away from her own loving, gentle, golden retriever brother at home) and that she just needed a quiet place to rest & observe during her stay. I was assured by MaLeisa they could accommodate that and that she would be fine.

Upon picking up our dogs we were told by MaLeisa that our sheltie "was playing in the yard with another dog and having a great time and next thing she knew, Todd was carrying her in because she had blood on her." Our dog had blood oozing from her ear, cuts across her face, was dry heaving and could barely walk. (And, "they had already washed her.") Our Sheltie collapsed in exhaustion once we got her into our vehicle. Unfortunately, our sweet girl had to be put down the following week as she never fully recovered from her injuries. 

Green Acres makes you sign a contract saying your dog will be dehydrated and exhausted upon returning home but that these are all normal results of a boarding experience. Add to that your dog will reek (which was explained away as being from the flood irrigation they use.) 

We had already pre-booked another stay at Green Acre for later in the month but obviously cancelled that stay after the injuries to our sheltie. I'm sickened and sad that I ever entrusted my dogs to the care of Green Acre.

Is it a club?  A show?  A bar?  A restaurant..?

I was confused before arriving, and I think I'm even more confused now that I've been.

At one moment, I'm in a study sipping on a hand crafted $16-plus-tax-plus-tip Mark Twain in "The Study", and the next I'm being swept into a private room by a young version of the Mad Hatter for story time.

After being given some punch which "aids in forgetting" about the story that I'm about to be told, I'm presented with a blindfold from a silver platter, which by the way, also holds an old school revolver.  The story, which is told by the Mad Hatter's counterpart, is deep and interesting, yet difficult to follow.  My heightened senses of hearing and scent are stimulated with various sound effects including the sound and smell of burning fire.  When I'm asked to remove my blindfold, there is a contorted woman in the room, doing a handstand, holding a bow & arrow with her feet, and aiming it at the Mad Hatter who is playing the piano on the opposite side of the small room.  After he is shot by the arrow and dragged out of the room, we're asked to quickly evacuate as well.

The level of weirdness and wonder doesn't change much throughout the night, as there is constantly something interesting going on.  Tap dancers on the bar, a guy playing a saw like a violin, singers, a female beat boxer, and more are just a few examples of the entertainment that seemed to pop up randomly both in context and location throughout.  I never knew where to comfortably take it all in, as at some points I was either behind the stage, hovering in the dining area, saddled up to the bar..  I always had that feeling that someone was going to tell me "you're not supposed to be here"; but they never did.

All these experiences occurred within a few short hours, and I was (almost) completely sober.  I'd definitely like to come back for more!

One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. 

Want a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? We've got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abs-so-freakin-lootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  

It seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you don't see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. 

Well I believe Dazzo's is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, "thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?"  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! 

And if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. 

Okay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef -- they have them all and they're cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!

Another plus are their French fries. They're exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. I'm not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. 

But when I do come back, I'll bring more Cash because they don't accept Plastic. 

Enjoy!

I love love love Sun Cyclery! Absolute best bike shop in all of Phoenix. I bought my last two bikes from Sun. Larry, Joe, Adam, Allen, they're all great. They always help me find what I need. They have the best customer service in the world. I'm sure of it. Sometimes I visit them just to hang out and see what's new. That's how cool they are. I was in yesterday having my hub flipped from a single speed to a fixed gear. (Yes they teased me, yes it was playful and welcomed, haha!)

We live in the neighborhood and the guys are always happy to air up our tires and oil our chains. Plans in the works to get the boy a bigger bike for his birthday. They do layaway here so that's awesome. They buy and sell used bikes too! When you buy a bike from Sun they ask you to bring back your bike in a month or so, for your first (and complimentary) tune up (about a $40 value). 
 
The shop has recently been renovated and looks beautiful with the wood paneling on the walls and the extra space. Huge selection of bikes in the shop and out back. Tell the guys what you're looking for and they'll be happy to make some suggestions, pull out bikes for you to try, and get you on the road with a beautiful new ride! 

If you're in the market for a bicycle or just need a tuneup you should absolutely stop at Sun Cyclery. Say hello for me!

I love this place- the packaging is high-quality,  the space is pretty and bee-themed (love the honeycomb chalkboard signage!), and the juices are downright delicious! I appreciate the fact that they use high-quality ingredients and source from nearby California, and I especially love that their juices are bottled to take and enjoy over the next few days. Add in that they're raw, organic, non-HPP, and everything else Gwyneth Paltrow would approve of, and you've got a stellar product. 

I recently moved here from the Bay area and was unpleasantly surprised that so many places here in LV claim that they have juice, only to give me an overpriced rinky-dink plastic cup with a non-harmonious medley of fruits and veggies. I am sorely missing vendors like Juicer Heroes, Project Juice, and the ever-convenient Pressed Juicery.

I am so happy to find a company putting for the quality of product that I expect when I am juicing. I will admit to being a little put off by pricing- which is $10+/bottle, higher even than trendy Cali prices, by a good 20%. They have a niche product though, and their portions are slightly larger. I will definitely be taking advantage of their bottle-return discounts though. I would like to be able to pull up nutritional info on each particular juice online, as it is not posted on the bottle itself: their website also is well-designed and informative, just as they are in-store. 


Overall: service is friendly, space is attractively decorated, and the product itself is high-quality. I hope to see more local companies picking up the slack and providing more options that are on par with the standard set here at Juice Standard!
I do hope they add some sort of loyalty discount program for frequent juicers as they settle in- I love a liquid lunch but I can't swing $300/month for it.

Favorite juices so far are Bee Effective (greens), Bee On Point, and Bee Loved.

You can take the boy out of Chicago but you can't take the Chicago out of the boy. Being from Chicago, I've been meaning to try this place for ages.I mean what a cool name, Chizona, pretty easy to figure it out, some McHenry, Illinois guys running a CHIcago place in ariZONA.

I was jonsing for their pizza since it smelled so good but after having pizza two days in a row, I opted for the Gyro and fries. The gyro came with onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce plus cut fries with the skins on them. I love the fries, they give you a very generous amount. The gyro was great as well, My wife loved their Italian Beef and said it was better than Al's Beef (sorry Al). My only complaint is there isn't a self serve soda machine, just cans of soda for a dollar. I'm definitely coming back for some pizza because it sure smells good.

I've just finished my own personal challenge of writing 100 reviews in 2012.

I don't get to Five Guys as often as I should, mainly because they started out my way on the east coast and are pretty much everywhere.  So I basically ended up with a case of burnout.  But since it was National Cheeseburger Day, and we were on a tight schedule for lunch, we decided to stop in since it was only a block or so from our hotel.

The thing to realize about Five Guys is that a "little" cheeseburger is actually a normal-sized burger anywhere else.  A regular burger there is actually two patties.  So from there I went with a little bacon cheeseburger, with all of the fixings.  And I immediately realized my mistake in overlooking how good Five Guys is.  It was just a delicious burger, perfectly moist, and bursting with flavor.  Hotdogs have always seemed to be a weak spot and that was still the case at this location.  For as complex and delicious as the burgers are, the dogs are always plain and one note.  Even loading them up with toppings doesn't help.

Note that an order of fries is a massive portion.  You can choose between regular or cajun, but either way you'll have your fill of carbs for about a week.

But don't make my mistake and overlook FG.

I love this place for breakfast! They have a huge selection of extremely delicious (and fattening) breakfast pastries. However, they also have options for those more health conscious. Their veggie sandwich was amazing... goat cheese, asparagus, tomato, onion...YUM. It was warm and crispy and just perfect. The wait can get a little long especially on the weekends, but the staff is always accommodating and efficient. The people next to our table were waiting for their order for quite some time and one of the staff came out and brought three complementary pastries for them because of the wait. Their food arrived shortly after and they shared their pastries with us! How nice...on all accounts! Overall i am excited to sample more of their menu..the smoked salmon sandwich looked pretty enticing.

The four of us came here for lunch and had a great time.

Spinato's has a nice ambiance as you enter and you will notice a great many Chicago posters, such as Illinois Central, Chicago Worlds Fair and B&W photos of the bridges crossing the Chicago River. Nice!

The food is equally good. The four of us each ordered different pizzas but really enjoyed the flavor.  This not your classic Chicago deep dish place, so you might be surprised by the thin crust cut into squares.  We really enjoyed it, and reminded us of the Edwardo's chain.  http://www.edwardos.com/

The pizza also has that sweet tomato sauce they served in St. Louis.  My friend Marvin A. is right, "it's over the top" sweet.  And it will surprise you when you first try it, but it works well.  In St Louis, they use Provel cheese which has a more buttery and creamy taste.  But here the manager Tim assures me they use mozzarella.  Still, it was very good.  

We enjoyed Spinato's and will be back.

Enjoy!

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

Suck it up.  I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I love their quirky drink names, the sleek packaging, and how there's more than just boba [gobi poppers and nunu yummies] you can add into the drinks but man do I hate the way they run things!  

This place is always busy and the line spews well past their awkwardly placed pillar and into the rest of the food court.  They should probably utilize some kind of name system or order number because if you're not paying attention, someone can walk away with your drinks.  Two smooch-sized [large] drinks costs about $12 which is like $2 more per drink than any other boba house around the valley but you pay for the convenience of having bubble tea inside a nicer shopping mall.  

Since it's always so busy, their bobas are always soft and chewy --- I dig the freshness.  I'm loving the yogurt gobi poppers.  Explosive!  Another good thing about the place is you can choose what kind of sweetener and creamer for them to use.   Truvia?  Non-dairy creamer?  Yes please!  The menu isn't as large as everyone says but since they did go with a clever naming system, you can't just go, "I want a taro boba."  You would have to comb through the menu and see that it's called a Purple Haze.  This can be a bit confusing but you'll get the hang of it.

Anyways, Boba Tea Company is definitely a trendier bubble tea place and I'll probably come back again and again when I feel like standing around for 15 minutes to order and receive some drinks.  YOGURT GOBI!  WOO!

[You still owe me a drink, Bretters.  I'm putting you on Blast!]

Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.

Estiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the "other" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?

Milos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.

Grilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.

Finally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.

Tip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.

Very good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.

A restaurant that has vastly improved with time.

I stopped by here for lunch and tried out their lunch special, 2 slices of cheese and a 20 ounce bottled soda for $5.95 including tax. There were 3 employees inside when I walked in who all greeted me and were very nice. They have tables inside and a TV. I sat at a table while my food was being prepared and it wasn't long before it was ready. I also asked for a "Cannoli" priced at $3.25 to be packed to-go and it was made fresh to order. The pizza was just so-so to me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. The price was certainly right! The Cannoli was actually very good and one of the best I have had. Those alone are worth stopping by for.

They offer delivery to a wide range of the valley.

Hands down, my favorite burger in Vegas! I don't even go for the fusion burgers (which are incredible) but rather a purists' version. Wagyu beef with cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato, and ketchup. Simple but sweet and a classic all the way! Why mess with perfection?

The burgers are always cooked on point here. I fluctuate between med rare and rare, and the fact that each time I switch it up and can tell the difference is a testament to the deft hands working the grill back there. The beef itself is pure, juicy, fatty indulgence. Add quality cheddar? A masterpiece. The buns here really set it over the top- a Taiwanese style sweetbread that's crunchy against the patty and veggies but supple on top, so that it melds itself around the rest of the burger.

If that's not enough to bring you in, the Bachi pickles should be. With a great variety of about 6, each made in house, it's such a great way to start- and end!- the meal, especially with its digestive properties. Crunchy sweet garlic, bracing daikon, vibrant radishes.. The rotation changes on any given day.

Out of all the fries, the salt and pepper are my favorite garnished with fresh leaves of cilantro, thinly sliced jalapeos and fried ginger. I love it with the Yuzu aioli.

Endless matcha iced green teas, a great beer selection, creative desserts- there isn't a reason for you not to drop by.

The Better Half and I visited this place for the 1st time last week.  I am a huge fan!  Here's why:

- Easy access off of Harmon Ave, which is off the Strip.

- The property has two entrances on the Strip.  You can sit at a bar or slot machine and have an awesome view of the street level of the Strip.  I bet this will be a great spot on NYE!

- I love the design and decor of the property (see pics).  Chandeliers, various designs in different areas of the casino floor are very impressive.  The artwork here is great too and all over the place.....you have to see it for yourself!

- Jason the Jeweler (designer of the Lakers' 2010 Championship Ring) has a store here.

- Although we didn't eat here, the food options look great.  We want to come back and try Holsteins & STK.

- The employees are very friendly and have a great attitude.  I know they just opened and you should expect that, but believe me it's hard to find that attitude here in Vegas.

- Parking was easy.  The self-parking garage is underground and has the meters that show you how many spaces are available on each level, bonus.

- The bars & lounges here are very cool.  We had drinks at Bond and the Chandelier Lounge.  Both places were comfortable and provided great people watching seats.

Overall, we enjoyed the place and have a bunch of places we want to come back and try out.  I hope they make it in this economy.

Will I return?  Are you crazy?  Of course I will!

My quest for the ultimate donut in Vegas continues. This time I visited the Donut Hut, another highly regarded establishment in the Yelp community. Will this take the throne of Ronald's? We shall see.

A small shop located on the east side of Vegas, it's on Desert Inn and Mojave, between Pecos-Mcleod and the 515. I've never actually driven on this road before. It's so old school, it's like driving through a time warp! The hours are great, Tues-Sun 7:30 pm to 1 pm; it's great for late night snacks, and morning breakfast (I think the guy changes the hours regularly, so, don't hold me to those hours)

The donuts here are more of your traditional variety. I decided to pick up three to go.

- Apple Fritter : It was crisp, and soft in the middle. It doesn't have as much apple flavor as the one at Ronald's. Plus, the one at Donut Hut is smaller than the one at Ronald's. But otherwise, it was very tasty.

Glazed donut - well made glazed donut. Soft, but not doughy. Not too sweet, which is good. 

Cruller - first time trying a cruller. Choux dough shaped in a fluted ring, then fried. Light and airy, not too sweet. It was solid.

I paid 3.85 for all three, and I got a really good value for what I paid. Does this beat out Ronald's? No. It is a great option for those living out east, or those who want a late night donut.

BTW, when you enter the store, you will see pictures of policemen all over the wall. The owner told me why.. policemen are the best judges of a good donut. LMAO

Arizona's okay. 

Arizona when drunk is awesome.

When coming to Shotgun Betty's, your perspective will probably be influenced greatly by your expectations and also your gender. And, the time of day you visit.

If you're a guy and you just want to get drunk at a bar (and don't want to get dressed up to do it), Shotgun Betty's will satisfy your cravings both for liquor and eye candy.

The girls who work here are pretty much all 9s and 10s in a porn video sort of way (I mean that as a compliment), and they are all friendly enough, especially if you have a roll of dollar bills.

If you hand out fives and tens you might earn a nice, Cointreau-flavored kiss, depending on the girl.

It's crowded because it's such a low-pressure bar and they let in everyone. The drinks suck, but it's a dive and the girls have a "but I'm pretty" excuse going for them.

A huge percentage of the patrons will be total dirtbags and creeps, but what do you expect when the girls gyrate on stripper poles and there's no cover charge to get in.

If you're a girl coming to this bar, you'll be in the minority because most of the patrons are boozed up men, whose attention will be given to the hottie dancing on the bar in her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots. 

If you come in for a boozer-nooner, and enjoy a meal at the bar, you'll find that the girls who work here are not mindless airheads. Not that they're going to work on the space station sometime in the future, but they're really cool.

Mixed drinks are much better during the day because there's not such a huge crowd, it's light outside, and the girls probably have more time to gin the tonics and coke the rums.

The music is mostly rock and roll, with bits of metal and country thrown in for good measure. Such a soundtrack always bangs, but after your fifth Jaeger bomb it's positively orgasmic.

So, when you come back to your real town, and your friends say, "Hey man, what did you do this weekend?" And you reply, "Went to Arizona," and they come back with, "Oh, sorry..."

--you can hit them with, "Yeah I went to Scottsdale."

"Did you go to Shotgun Betty's?"

"That's why I went to Scottsdale."

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

Shhhhhh!  Don't tell my friends but one of the hottest guys in the show was gay.  I didn't realize this until he realized I was gay and offered me his lap to sit on for the picture.  There's nothing really telling about the moment.  It was just a feeling.

As I sat on his muscular legs, I was like "umm...this Jaymes Vaughan fellow is such a sweetie pie."  Then it hit me, he's most likely a southern gay.

He was a great emcee, full of charisma, warmth, and humor.  Not that a straight guy can't be those things.  But...yeah.

And he was hot, way hotter than his pictures--which captures his body beautifully but not his face.  That's a good thing.  Why wouldn't you want the performers to be better looking live for a live show.

Pleasant surprise.

And at the end of the show, he gave me a shout-out for being the only guy in the audience and said I would totally get laid that night by one of my three female companions.  Awkward heteronormative moment but not in the annoying way.  My friends got a chuckle because they knew better.

I thought this show was going to be so cheesy and homophobic but it's quite gay-friendly.  Audience friendly in general.

Nothing trashy.  

Very suggestive.  

And lots of great naked butts.

Really great.  

Expect women to go crazy.

Really crazy.

If Chippendales is something you're thinking of going to see, you really just should!  Put this expected Vegas experience on your list and cross it off.  I didn't necessarily find all the performers hot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

Doesn't matter if the dancers are straight or gay, it's fantasy.  I've always been a fan of thinking.

Thanks Kristin for hooking us Yelpers up with a deal for the Yelp Spring Break.

Well Happy New Year everyone!

I was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: "Alas, poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him" well!  

Seems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago, replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place, in that case Al's Beef.

I arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding saut onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.

There was a nice amount cheese and sauce, with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an "ultra thin" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side, Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list

So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Many fine dining restaurants in Vegas resorts seem to be having recession specials right now, so we decided to take advantage of a $39 prix fixe menu L'Atelier is offering. We found out that they stop serving this particular pre-theater menu at 6:45pm. We were running late, and got in closer to 7pm, but the chef still accommodated us. 

The three course meal was served bento box style, with even the dessert on the plate. I can see how this is a convenient wham, bam, thank you ma'am option for people rushing to catch a Vegas show. 

I ordered the king crab and cous cous appetizer, osso buco entree and peach panna cotta dessert. While everything was tasty, portions were definitely on the small side, and nothing that blew me away. It wasn't the quality you'd expect from a Joel Robuchon restaurant. 

Service was pretty mediocre as well. Just because L'Atelier is the more affordable and trendy alternative to its sister restaurant, it doesn't mean it shouldn't put out excellent food and service too.

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

I read a Yelp talk thread that was singing the praises of Niccoli's Deli & Pizza a couple of months ago. So I decided to take the plunge after my office moved to CenPho.

This is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.

They don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.

I definitely will be a regular customer of Niccoli's.

We came here for a cup of coffee and decided to order some eggs and bacon. Clearly bacon is their strong suit and the coffee was really very good as well.

I decided to come back the next day and see if yesterday was a fluke. Since we generally liked our original visit over a year ago but at the time we found things somewhat uneven.

Well the good news to report is that since my first visit with fellow Yelp'ers and Pepper Head Mark, things have improved. Service can be a bit slow during busy periods, they have definitely improved. The sad sausage I had eighteen months ago has been retired. It's been replaced by a very flavorful one (see photos).

Today we ordered the French Toast and the Oink's French Toast. The latter is just over the top sweet and a bit too much for this gourmand. While the regular French Toast would be enjoyed by every Gourmet as being just right. Look that up in your Roget's. LOL

Expect to pay $15 each if you don't order a 4 piece (1/2 flight) or 8 piece (full flight) of their absolutely delicious thick flavored bacon. If you do, and I would recommend that you do, then expect to pay accordingly, around $22-$25.  But ohhh, but it's sooo worth it!

Enjoy!

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. 

Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.

 Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? 

Misc:
Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.
The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.
Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!
Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. 
Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. 

Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

The other evening, I felt like Bubba in the Forrest Gump movie, shrimp this and shrimp that, and with so many combinations to choose from, hot, cold, on ice, in a spicy broth, with rice, yada yada yada -- it was all glorious.  Of the 152 (or so) items, I may have tasted 37 of them (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#YkaPn9HxhtwF0nqv9uWZKA), and returned again for 5 items, and then again for 2 of my favorites, and again for the same 2 favs, and again for the same 2 favs, until I nearly busted.  Clearly, the best dish was the steamed mix of lobster tails (small 2-3" but who cares, grab 30 of'em) and butterflied large shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#ml546xqPEKewFaW1blGmow).  This beats setting out nets to catch on my own, or waking up at 4am to go fishing.  When the last shrimp rolled around for about 3 minutes before I could swallow it, I knew the feast was over for me -- I was clearly out of the contest.

With varied stations of seafood (hot and cold), and alternatives (a small bit of Mexican, salads, sushi, and Mediterranean among others), a carving station, etc, Village Seafood Buffet is exactly as it states "seafood", and this is the kind of village I'd like to live in.  The rent is a bit high at $44.95 ($5 off with players card).  But c'mon, you know your a play'a...and it's your turn to take that position over, as I've died and gone to heaven.

P.S.  For an extra $11.95, you can add AYCD wine or beer during your dining.

PSS.  Don't forget to take the Lobster Mashed Potatoes...it's soooo good!

Fabulous find. 

We were leaving Macy's and I asked "where do you want to go for lunch?"  We remembered there was a Habit Burger across the street, so off we went.

So here we are walking past Garbanzo. It was very dark inside with their tinted windows and the signs on the window said "Space Available." So I thought "Wow" that was fast, didn't they just open?  Well, another Phoenix business has closed. 

We get to Habit and the line is out onto the sidewalk. D'oh!  But just then, someone leaves Garbanzo and the lights inside tell a different story. Yes, they're open.  It turns out the sign "Space Available", was for another store.  So the heck with burgers, let's eat Greek/Middle Eastern.  Sorry Habit!

Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed.

You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand. 

So. Fucking. Good.

My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.

The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.

Everything was homemade. And when I say "everything," I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue. 

Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate. 

Go there. You won't be disappointed. 

But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it.

My Sweet lovers guide to vegas treats!!

Jean Phillipe patisserie is a must. They have two locations, bellagio with the famous chocolate fountain display  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=5CTu6r-oMEnATEqkMQFtYg and the one at Aria  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg which is bigger and has an area to sit down and indulge. U can have a variety of cakes, gelato, chocolates, crepes, pastries.. They do not sell individual macarons but u can buy a packaged set. The crepe, mousse cake and creme brulee gelato I had were all excellent!

Max Brenner @ Caesars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=VM3v-ly8TaqF6Gi21XOCTg is chocolate lovers dream! The chocolate smell wafting alone is intoxicatingly delicious. They not only have a boutique of chocolate treats, u can eat a fabulous meal here and make sure to get a chocolate chip walnut cookie: the best I ever had! 

Check out sugar factory at PH http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pNR0cAPdO4RHulVTFssn-A?select=eFmRocS3vcKGcJNlBTibOQ if u love gummies, lollies etc. but the cupcakes, macarons, gelato looked pretty ordinary.

Bouchon bakery at the Venetian  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=U4VwyUcdlz4Mlsl3hqb5Ug is a great stop if you've never been to any of the bouchon bakeries. It's a small stand as opposed to a shop. Signature bouchons r always great, their macarons r not my fave but huge and pretty. A new fave for me is their carrot whoopie pie!

Vosges at the Forum shoppes is a cool place to check out if u like exotic flavor chocolates. But it can be  pricey.
If u like banana cream pie, the one at Emerils at MGM is awesome!

I went to Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=v2QzpbqjH_ok7MlKhQsnpw expecting awesome desserts but altho beautiful, I was not too impressed.

Didn't get to check out Payard at Caesars but they have macarons there, altho i'm sure they don't beat Paulettes (now called Lettes) in LA.  Dessert at Wynn buffet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg was disappointing

Other highlights of vegas eats for me was Cosmopolitan pizza, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon@ MGM and Earl of Sandwich @ PH.

Shows: Jabbawockeez at Monte Carlo was super fun and very memorable!

If ur going from LA, if they r open, make sure to visit My Delight Cupcakery in Ontario on the way home. They have the best cupcakes around!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-delight-cupcakery-ontario#query:my%20delight%20cupcaker

Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.

A puff pastry lid tops a "pot" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  

Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.

Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.

For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. 

Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.

Sometimes simple is best.  American Fish delivers.

I count my lucky stars that I am so fortunate to be able to finally eat at  by Jos Andrs.  It was a special occasion and we (surprisingly my husband included because he usually prefers cheap Chinese food over frou frou stuff) both thoroughly enjoyed the EXPERIENCE.  It was a precisely choreographed dance to put together these pieces of food, a play on textures, temperatures and flavors.  It was an experience with the art of food, and I'm not saying it with any disdain for snobbiness this time.  There were 24 morsels of delicious food - all incredibly creative.

The short and sweet version: Precision.  Perfectly choreographed and executed.  Juxtaposition of Flavors and Textures.  Adjectives that come to mind:  Fragrant.  Whimsical.  Airy.  Crunchy.  Ice Cold.  Salty and Sweet.  Warm.  Fluffy.  Umami.  Crumbly.

1.  Rebujito - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses.  
2.  Truffle Cotton Candy - whimsical, fluffy with the aroma of truffle.  
3.  Idiazabal "Macaron" - delightfully crunchy with a cheesy filling
4.  Apple "Brazo De Gitano" - Airy on the outside, creamy blue cheese "espuma" on the inside
5.  Seta Suprise - Creamy 'shrooms
6.  Nitro Almond Cup - NITROGEN cold (not just ice cold) and smooth on the outside, creamy/briny/salty caviar on the inside.
7.  Barquillo - crunchy shell, aromatic Truffle and anchovy foam
8.  Almejas Al Natural - spherical globules encased with the essence of oyster 
9.  Bocatade Bacalao - warm, buttery brioche, savory cod, umami-licious?
10. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - extra crispy chicken skin + foam
11. Cava Sangria - Pop!  globule of sangria 
12. Artichoke "Puree" with vanilla - creamy, mild, smooth
13. Lobster with Citrus & Jasmine - tender lobster with jasmine flavored air
14. Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham - globules of essence of chickpea and accents of ham
15. Turbot with Bone Marrow - salty/sweet/bitter combo with crispy bone marrow, turbo fish and coffee grinds
16. Lobe of Foie Gras - savory foie gras combined with fresh orange juice 
17. Secreto of Iberico Pork with Squid + Parsley Foam - tender, squid was a touch burnt I thought
18. Santa Gadea with Cotton Candy - "goat in sheep's clothing," goats milk with sweet cotton candy
19. Flan - creamy, light and airy
20. Pan con Chocolate - MY FAVORITE DESSERT OF THE NIGHT.  Crumbled frozen chocolate sorbet with cream, hints of saffron, crunchy sweet crystallized bread, and olive oil.  
21. "Arroz con Leche" - Another well played piece on texture, temperature and flavor
22. 25 second Bizcocho - fluffy cake with lemon cream
23. Air Chocolates - wow.  bitter chocolate and I usually really like dark chocolate 
24. Cocoa Paper with Dried Strawberry - airy light chocolate with tangy freeze dried strawberry bit

$ to Value Ratio:  4.75/5 Stars... This is definitely debatable (my mom may think it's a complete waste of money), but I rated it high because my experience was impeccable (service was top notch, ingredients were top notch)

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

I've had the chance to visit Hakkasan and XS this past weekend and let me tell you that XS completely blows it out of the water on almost every level.  Sure Hakkasan has exclusive contracts with deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup is nothing to scoff at: Porter Robinson, Knife Party, Avicii, Steve Angello, Eric Prydz, Afrojack, etc.   But an amazing club experience from a consumer's standpoint is more than just who comes on the decks at 1:30AM.  

There are a plethora of factors, both tangible and intangible, that these new clubs neglect that ultimately leads me to the conclusion that XS remains the best club in Las Vegas over Hakkasan and Marquee.  Here are a few reasons:

1) Hakkasan should be renamed Hakkastairs due to the massive amount of stairs that you cannot avoid and you MUST take to even get into the main dance floor.  This is also a major problem with Marquee's presale line as you HAVE to walk up like 10 flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor.  Have fun with that in your 5 inch heels ladies.

2) No outdoor patio area?!?!  Is this real life?  No pool? What is this 2006?

3) No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No I don't want to pay 9 dollars for your bottle of water.  And give me the option to play blackjack and lose $1000 but at least I get a couple free drinks.

4) With XS and Marquee, when you have a presale ticket, you never have to wait more than 10-15 minutes.   Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour. 

5) No re-entry stamps at Hakkasan....seriously?  But what if its just me and a couple of my guy friends and we get there at 9:00PM just to get stamps with the intention of coming back at a more reasonable Vegas club time at 11:30ish?  

6) Hakkasan was such a letdown that my friends and I left before the headliner even came on.  Hakkasan is like a nicer marquee (inside only as there is no outside to hakkasan).  To Hakkasan's credit, they have a very spacious dance floor and their production value of their lights and lazers is unmatched but a club experience is more than that and XS beats Hakkasan down badly when it comes to every other relevant factor

7) I've heard that Hakkasan charges 43% on top of your table minimum... Now I see how they are paying abnormally above market prices for deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris.  This is absurd.

Unfortunately the hype for Hakkasan was too big since it was supposed to be the XS killer but just like Marquee, they both fall very short of the top tier in which XS stands alone.

Now we get to see Light take its shot on Memorial Weekend.

TLDR; Hakkasan was overhyped and I was very underwhelmed.  XS remains the best nightclub hands down for a variety of factors.

If you're a fan of modern Japanese -- the kind that Nobu made popular and places like Social House reimagined -- you'll love the food at Soho. The chef owner is the former executive chef at Social House and has brought his fusion-style of cooking to the 'burbs. That means Strip-quality food at off-Strip prices.

The strip mall location is nothing special and the interior is quaint and understated. But, it's the food that shines at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with the yellowtail yuzu soy ($10), tuna or hamachi tostadas ($2 ea.), or the angus gyoza ($5). The miso marinated black cod ($18) is as good as any I've had on or around the Strip (including the one at Nobu).

The variety of rolls may be limited, but the quality and execution is solid. This is not an all you can eat place, so expect to spend a little more for a higher end product.

The subtle sweetness and silky creaminess of the vanilla creme brulee ($5) was a great way to end the meal. If chocolate is your thing, try the chocolate mousse ($7). It's the perfect balance of sweet and bitter chocolate with cocoa crumbles and cookie pieces to add variety in texture.

The chef/owner stopped by to chat, which is always a nice touch to show that he cares about the diner's experience. With beautifully presented and well crafted food, Soho is a welcome addition to the local scene. For people on a budget, like myself, it's just another reason to dine in the 'burbs instead of the Strip.

Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  "Italian" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a "Pizza Sandwich" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called "Bigs", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

Tandoori Times

Volume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.  

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."

They say good things come in small packages. Well this has to be the smallest Peter Piper that I've been to yet. 

What I really like about this place is that they actually have pizzas lined up and ready to eat.  A fair share of Triple P's aren't ready for the 11:30 lunch crowd and hardly have any pizzas available. I chalk that up to poor management. They're usually too busy making pizzas for the carry out crowd instead of the dining room. This place is the exception and seems to be managed correctly.

Another thing that is very cool about this location is that they give you one of those flashing buzzers when your customized pizza is ready to go. So you don't look like an ass when you're cutting in line to get your special order. I hate when I order a pizza and it's half way eaten by the time I get up there.

As far the taste, of course Peter Piper is an average tasting product but it's a cheap lunch. The only thing is that this place can get pretty crowed since it has a relatively small dining room. But they do have plenty of parking.

We have a lot of snow falling here in the Vegas Valley lately! Shaved SNOW  that is! Frost Bites Shavery caught my attention when I read "Snow Cream" "Smoother" and "Black Sesame" and saw that Michael K's check was in Henderson!  I don't proclaim to be an expert of this dessert that originated in Taiwan but after trying Frost Bites Shavery's version, now we're talkin this is what shaved snow cream is all about.

Walked up and was elated to see Green Tea and Black Sesame flavors on the menu!  Mike the owner and creator was really gracious and offered samples of any flavors I wanted to check out. That's when I discovered the difference between here and the other place. Frost Bites Shavery is the REAL DEAL!

When it was presented to me, it was in ribbon like layers, even looked fluffier and no granular ice crystals like I had at Kuma's. Frost Bites Shavery was way smoother and texture reminded me of fresh fallen snow. It's NOT Snow Cones or shave ice..but a mixture of the two, hence shaved snow! Big plus it's all natural, you won't go into sugar shock from having flavored syrups drowned in ice.
 
Taste wise the flavors I tried ( Mango, Green Tea, Coconut, Black Sesame) had much more depth. Especially the Green Tea. Black Sesame fans will really appreciate this, Mike said he roasts and grinds the black sesame himself.  In fact, all ingredients used to make snow cream are all natural including fresh fruit used to make the Mango snow cream! Which tastes fresh and fruity!  No canned fruit for topping either. That's why Lychee is missing. Can't get it fresh, so they passed on it.  Other flavors I saw were Coffee and your traditional flavors of Chocolate, Strawberry and Vanilla for those who aren't the adventurous types.
 
Price: In line with all the other icy treat stands in the area. Range from $2.25 - $6.25 toppings additional .50 cents.  There are four different sizes. I appreciate they have a kid size for the little ones.
 
Location: Along Boulder Highway between Major and Greenway/Palo Verde. You're reference point is the marquee for Smith's Grocery. It's a freestanding structure. You'll see the pastel blue and white trailer/food truck right on Boulder closer to corner of Greenway/Palo Verde.   Plenty of parking. There's a canopy for shade and a couple of chairs.
  
This snow cream is tastier and  healthier can't beat that! I'm a fan!  Five Stars most def!

"All You Need Is Love." - John Lennon

Mirage spending a lot marketing this show; you can see a huge Beatle Love Logo from their Hotel.  After all, they invest like 100 millions in innovation the stage.  These stages used to be the iconic Siegfried & Roy Magic show with the white lions and tigers.   One of the big cost of the new stage is in fact all 2,000 seat have an individual speakers placed in the back.  That feature help bring the sound balance in all seats.  In addition, the stage can be open and close just like other Cirque du Soleil, except no water in this one.  However, a lot of perfume foggy effect, and many high-tech lighting systems.

The entrance to the show was nicely done; it felt like you walk to an upscale nightclub.  The show is a lot more about the music, is really the heart and souls of the Cirque Du Soleil acrobat performers.  Performer of all ages were part of the show, some stunts does not look like it had any safety strap despite been like over 100 feet in the air.  The best act I think was the Come Together, that act was flawless it require perfect timing between several performer. That song was a great fit of the act.  Not every act was excellent, but there more than a few dozen would wow you.

This is my first time watching Cirque Du Soleli, and I am definite a fan of them.  Looking forward to see the famous water show like O and Le Reve.  I basically got this show for free view the special hotel reservation promotion.  The shows tickets value were higher than our hotel stay in the Monte Carlo.  At top of that, our seat were been upgrade from balcony to second row !

"Nope.  No way.  I'm not going to an 'Asian' restaurant recommended by a white dude from the Midwest that isn't on W  Sahara.  Not going to happen" I say, arms crossed.

"Yeah but you won the bet.  I paid for the car so I get to choose.  You can sit in the car if you like.  It's only 108.  I'll crack a window for you" he says triumphantly.

And for once...

Impressive.

A cross between Korean and other Asian cuisines using  western ingredients.  Each dish is very well constructed.  Each with a nod towards Korean flavors.  Each using those flavors to elevate other ingredients.

True standouts after sampling almost the entire menu include:

10 hour braised and the 30 hour sous vide Berkshire pork belly.  The braised belly, with it's perfectly seared finish, tender and juicy, the sous vide belly, meltingly tender, well rendered.  Both pre-marinated in soy for an earthy sweetness.  Both served in natural jus with kimchi crepe.  Crispy shoestring sweet potato adds the perfect textural foil.

The cold smoked yellowtail and salmon, both over apricot wood that imparts a gentle sweetness is impressive.  The first garnished with apple, the second with orange.  A dusting of ground laver and a dressing of a apricot sauce mixed with Korean chili powder for subtle heat that enhances the natural sweetness of the cold smoked fish..

Not to be missed, a perfectly pan roasted monk fish with over a bed of root veg dressed with Korean chili powder,.  A shrimp risotto (sake steamed shrimp, shitake mushroom risotto topped with a crispy deep fried shrimp head.  The black Bean sauce noodles, so seemingly simple but once you mix the egg yolk through the dish, explodes with velvety, fermented goodness.  Finally a smoked mackerel pasta; think mentaiko with  morsels of slightly bitter fish atop pasta mixed with just the right amount of kimchee.  

Excellent service.  Sit at the bar for the best experience.  The only weakness is the wine, sake, soju list.

Strip worthy at off Strip prices.

Aloha! Mele Kelikimaka! Don Ho! That's pretty much all the Hawaiian I know. I'm delighted a little bit of our island state has reached Central Phoenix. And I say little because, clearly, this is not authentic Hawaiian, nor are they trying to be. Let's start with the ugly. Cuz there's lots of good stuff to like about Hula's. Probably not the New York Steak Sandwich. Which I quickly renamed the Rhode Island Steak Sandwich. Cuz it was teeny tiny. And that's not so bad, except it was served on a large hamburger bun slathered in Hula sauce and a couple slabs of Monterey Jack and loads of Maui onions which were outstanding! It fell apart quicker than my Aunt Helen when I told her I was a mo. Wait? Have I used that line before? Anyway with the sandwich I had the cole slaw which had fresh ginger in it and I loved it! Rickie's Cajun burger and field green salad was delicious as was our friends Cobb Salad complete with diced fried Spam! And just like the islands' friendly culture, the staff here was spot on with service, smiles and suggestions. Prices on our food hovered around $10 a plate. 

Now. The space. LOVING IT! Think Brady Bunch decor meets Hawaiian lore. There's a large, kickass photo in the dining room with some 60s/70s hipsters sipping bubbly around a pool with a Camelback Mountain lookalike in the background. Sort of looked like a still from an episode of McMillian and Wife (ok, this is where I lose anyone born after 1975!). 

Much like St. Francis, I love the textures. From the tiny tile on the wall near the restrooms, to the horizontal wood paneling, the nifty lighting above the bar and of course, the dozens of tikis lining the room. Eventually the two glass garage doors were opened to a beautiful AZ breeze and we could almost feel the slight heat from the fire pit on the patio. Though I did get a bit of a stench from about a dozen gnarly, pimpled skateboarders on the sidewalk. 

This is a 3.5 review FYI Hula's. Welcome to the desert! Welcome to CenPho. And as they say in Hawaii...um...hmmm...well...I dunno....Aloha?! Yep. Aloha!

Oh Lobsta, Lobsta, Lobsta!  

I do luv all things crustacean so you didn't have to drag me here for a lobster roll.  I've actually had some off the food trucks in Cali and really enjoyed them.  So I was eager to try the one's here. 

Combo Lobster roll with Garlic Tater Tots ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#2Lng3Y1DRRiTZgwO36aW_A  They offer 2 sizes medium or large.  I went with a medium and I have to say it had a decent amount of lobster meat in it.  The roll was buttered and grilled up on both sides.  It was perfect meat to bread ratio.  I went with the original flavor with a touch of mayo and lemon.  The menu only listed garlic fries but I like tots so I asked for switch-a-roo and asked for my tots to be married with garlic.

Here is my close up of the lobster seconds before it was consumed http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#yWfRR2jZGPrkV1wMVUNebQ

Ladies there is no pretty way of eating these so just shove it in your mouth and enjoy!  Worry about the mess later LOL!  It can get pretty pricey depending on what you order.  In the end it is lobster meat that your getting. 

Eyes ~ Oh Lobster Meeeeeee!
Nose ~ I smell a hint of garlic from my tots!.
Ear ~ Peeps walking by.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

What a great surprise, just around the corner from a closed Baja Fresh is Caf Rio Mexican Grill 

There's no comparison to that former Wendy's Mexican food concept. Cafe Rio is the real deal. 

We came here for lunch and then, since we were working late we came back to grab something for dinner.  It's crazy good.  It also wasn't as packed, but the food was really good. 

As you enter, you'll see that standard Mexican cantina decor. Tin lights with punch holes (photo) in them. Bright, very bright painted tables and beautifully made iron stone plates hanging on the walls. All very familiar, but nicer than you've seen before in other places.

After a few visits now, I've ordered most item on the menu.  My favorite?  Their Burrito, Enchilada style ($7.99) with spicy sauce and cheese on top.  Yummy!.  They have that homemade press (photo) working non-stop.  The Burrito stretches to fit, since it's so fresh and the dough hasn't become hard.  Love it.

Their Tacos ($2.99) are also good, as is their Guacamole ($1.99).  But you have to try their Lime-aide drink.  It tastes like a virgin Mojito!  BYOB I guess. LOL

Now I realize this is a chain, and therefore it might not be for everyone, but... a lunch here for $10.00, is a nice alternative to that other place with the corrugated stainless steel fetish.  You know who I mean.

Enjoy!

My friend and I have wanted to go to the Butterfly Wonderland for a while and the time came to go! We met up on a Sunday morning and got our ticket to check them out!  

What does Butterfly Wonderland got going for them? Well they are the only butterfly atrium in the valley and they say they are America's largest butterfly atrium too. , they say the butterflies inside the conservatory come from butterfly farmers from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Ecuador, Thailand & the Philippines as well as within the US and another fun fact Arizona is home to 344 species of butterflies.  Here comes the sticker shock: its 18.95 plus tax which equals to 20.26 I think it was.  

Once you pay your ticket you walk inside and have to wait in a hallway because you will be directed to watch a 14 minute movie on the migration of the Monarch Butterfly in 3D, we had to wait a few minutes because there was a show already playing.  The movie is cool; you follow a year in the life of a few Monarchs. 

Once your movie is over you are shown into the conservatory, now this is where the fun is it, so many amazing beautifies fluttering around, some look like they are in a game of tag, some just seeing what everyone else is up to, if you stand still and make small movements you might be blessed to have a few land on you, also was told if you wear bright colors they will be attracted to you too, You are not allowed to hold out your hand or try to touch them, but they are allowed to land on you.  I had a few land on me and also had a few fly too close to my face and gave me a butterfly smack or too! Haha  I could spend hours in the conservatory just watching the butterflies enjoying the sun light.

A few things, the conservatory is a tropical rain forest, its humid and misting water is happening, so dress for the rain forest, leave your bags & purses in the car, no need for all that, watch where you are walking the butterflies land everywhere and just make sure you don't step on them. Also inside the conservatory you will see a Koi fish pond, I thought that was cool but also thought hey don't they eat bugs that might land on the water,aawwee poor butterflies that became fish food .

Once you leave the conservatory you go into a smaller room and check to see if you are smuggling any butterflies, and I know that sounds funny, but there were a few that tried to escape before we went through the door. 

Then you get to check a cool ant farm, some fishes and other stuff, and even stick your hand in a tank to touch a sting ray, and yes I did that, but I have fed sting rays before too, it's a cool experience.

This was an enjoyable time, we spent maybe 2 hours enjoying everything, do I feel its worth the 20 buck entry fee, no I don't, but will I be a sucka and do it again yep I will haha.

Chef Daniel Boulud's triumphant return to Vegas.  This incarnation, a modern brasserie using the freshest, locally sourced, seasonal ingredients in updated, French classic dishes.  Intriguing elements in every dish brighten flavors and awaken the palate.  Add some beautifully imagined French craft cocktails; this is not your typical austere brasserie.

The requisite classics are there; a well made pate de champagne bourguignon with bits of this and that served with house made cornichons and whole grain mustard with bread, the authenticity of which is rarely tasted outside of Europe.  The obligatory shellfish plateau; a mountain of fresh seafood, begging for a glass of Sancerre.  The austere coq au vin, with it's perfectly braised pieces of chicken amidst lardoons, mushrooms and pearl onions.  All good but pale in comparison to dishes showcasing the chef's Michelin pedigree.

The artichoke veloute is incredible.  Velvety smooth.  Huge vegetal flavor of artichokes balanced with cream around a mushroom royale.  Bits of mushrooms provide texture.  A submerged "crouton" soaked in butter adds even greater richness.  Pair the dish with the "Bee's Knees" and be blown away by the complexity created by the sweetness, acidity, and richness.  The salmon rillettes, all the flavor of salmon, made smooth, rich, and creamy.  Hints of fennel add a wonderful anise notes, fried capers add texture and briny salinity.  Finally the dry aged Brandt ribeye.  Simply grilled served with a barnaise sauce, more acidic and with herbaceous notes than most that heightens the nutty, bleu cheese flavor of the steak.

Tip:  Lunch is a deal.  $26 for two courses, $33 for three.

Tip:  Match a craft cocktails with each dishes.  Cocktails are extremely complex with the use of many different bitters.  Most have great acidity.  Dare I say, perfect pairings work better than wine.

Very good wine list.  Heavy emphasis on France.  Decent vintage depth.   Best "value" in older vintages.  

Contemporary, bright ambiance.  Excellent, relaxed service.  You would never know the restaurant has been opened for only a month.

Definitely a welcome addition to the Vegas culinary scene.

Hated it.
Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it's centrally located. Yes, it's disgusting.

A couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted, yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap, and we paid for it.

I knew it was an older hotel, but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt, would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels, you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.

It took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk, but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun, too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.

Upon opening the door, we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture, stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.

Yes, it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet.

Vegas, day 50.  Final day of a successful WSOP.  Celebratory / farewell dinner for my poker buds.  Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. 

It's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.

Tip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.

The meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:

Issan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).

Sua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).

Plar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with sauted fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).

Charbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).

Garlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).

Massive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.

And to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.

Always a great culinary adventure.

With successful locations in NYC and Williamsburg, I expected the best pizza on this side of the Mississippi, but unfortunately I was dealt arguably the worst meal I've had in LV in the past 4.5 months. From the minute my takeout order was brought from the kitchen, I knew I was in for trouble. Here's a rundown of the eats...

Chicken Tikka Masala Pasta- $16 - Take away the creamy goodness of a masala sauce, take away any resemblance of chicken and imagine yourself eating dry, leftover spaghetti from a few days before. Voil! You have made this dish in your mind. Tamest masala this side of Bombay. Nothing against the pasta itself, I'm not hating on the lack of gluten, I'm hating on the lack of chicken, sauce and flavor. 

Chana Masala Personal Pizza- $13 - Take a generic flatbread you can buy in Walgreens, add a box of frozen chana masala from TJ's (minus most of the flavor), a bit of tomato sauce and some mozz cheese, then cook in a toaster, but take it out a few minutes before it's ready. Voil! You have again made a dish in your mind! Seriously, isn't this 'dough' the 'homemade specialty' of the house? When pizza is thin, isn't it supposed to be crunchy? Why does it taste like someone made this in Home Ec class... and got a C-? 

And yes, I ordered two Indian style dishes from an American/pizza place. But it's not a large menu. It's not like I was expecting fresh sushi from a diner. For the area, you can do way better with your money. 

While waiting for the food, I overheard some people wondering why the place is empty most of the time. 'It's this side of the street!' they said. No, friends. It's all of the above. 

Why 2-stars instead of 1? The place looks pretty slick. Would def have a brew at the bar.

For my 600th review, it seemed appropriate to write about the place that brought me to the scenic wonderland of the Midwest, The University of Illinois here in delightful Urbana-Champaign.

For a Southern California pseudo-hipster and person of color raised in Los Angeles and educated in San Diego, the U of I is a bit of a disorienting shock.  It's gigantic, yet full of personality and character.  It's also on some levels every stock stereotype about the 'college experience', from the pretentious architecture (that screams "we look like an East Coast college!!!  Bricks!!  Yay!!!") to the terrifying/amazing/astounding/bizarrely huge percentage of students involved in a Greek life that resembles in almost creepy detail the stereotypical movie depictions of said groups, to the absolute obsession Illini sports engenders.

I love a lot of it, with the fantastic resources, first class scholarship and immense potential.  I turned down Stanford and a few other 'name' schools as I was amazed and remain constantly impressed by their history doctoral program, and I'm thankful to be here for the education.  However, the location is a bit remote (although sometimes corn can be charming, I swear!), and there are some considerable issues here at U of I that have to be mentioned.

While the U of I is definitely a brilliant academic institution and a great place for meaningful exchanges of ideas, diversity is weak here, and cultural understanding/communication is particularly weak.  The issues surrounding the infamous mascot linger on years after its supposed resolution, and to be a person of color in central Illinois is occasionally a difficult and daunting prospect indeed.  I've been called the 'n' word already, and it's a hard place to process when there are screaming groups of students that have been known to have 'tacos and tequila' parties and still openly ask for the return of a racial caricature as a mascot.  It's daunting, but not insurmountable.

Most of the students I've met here are friendly, engaging, and generally cheerful.  They mean well, although it is *hard* to sometimes deal with racism either explicit or less intentional, honestly, and incidences like this year's vandalism of the Native American art exhibit outside the culture houses are emblematic of that.

That said, the school's trying.  The people of color are vibrant that are here, there is a good community, and it's growing.  I'm thankful for that.  There's a strong organizing tradition here.  People *care* about things, and it's nice to see.

A year after accepting their decision to come here, I don't regret it one bit, but Illinois is far from perfect or ideal.  It's a fantastic and wonderfully intellectually rigorous place, but it's also a daily challenge, particularly for us people of color who often have to fight to make our own spaces.  But I love it enough here to keep trying, and I certainly won't stop any time soon.

Besides, I've got at least another four years to go 'til I get to be Dr. Teej.

A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??

Yess!! 

It's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me, but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town, 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown, which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.

When it comes to Vietnamese food, I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho, so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving. 

When I order a bowl of Pho, I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with. 

Their broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together. 

Service could be better, but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice. 

If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, seek Pho Annie!!

Your typical, hometown themed sports bar.  Friendly staff, lots of TVs, and all of the bar food options you would expect.  The only real surprise was how dark it is in the restaurant. 

The menu who runs the gamut, with something to please every taste.  I love ordering nachos at sports bars, and Majerles' version passes the test.  They also make a very good club sandwich.  It's a thick sandwich, jammed full of cold cuts.  It comes served with shoestring fries, which look pretty plain but are deceivingly tasty.  Dessert options are limited, but there's enough to choose from to satisfy a sweet tooth.  

The restaurant itself is in a historical building, so it has a very weird shape to it.  There is a smaller side with a bar in the middle and tables along the perimeter, and the other side has a longer bar with tables running parallel to it.  But that side of the restaurant was closed during our visits there.

So if you're looking to catch a game and have some good bar food, Majerle's will definitely do the trick.

WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words "350 Pounds and Over Eat Free" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or "HAG" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs, making the show feel dramatic, exciting and unique***

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).

How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?

I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?

And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.

Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.

The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.
After you are seated by the friendly hostess, you are given two menus. The shorter "American" menu lists dishes familiar to diners used to "Americanized Chinese" restaurants: beef and broccoli, lo mien, chow fun, and the like. The longer "Hong Kong Style" menu lists dishes characteristic of the more authentic Southeastern Chinese dining establishments.  For example, you'll find Hong Kong style roast pork and roast duck, veggies such as choy sum and sweet pea shoots, various kinds of seafood and tofu dishes, and even dishes that are daunting for the less adventurous American diner (example: fried intestines). 
My friend and fellow yelper John M. (lucky guy, he lives near this place) and I thoroughly enjoyed our orders here. The ingredients were really fresh, the shrimp and fish so succulent and tender, the sauces very flavorful without being overly seasoned, the deep-fried tofu still silky and tender within, the fried rice treated lightly so that it was not greasy. Great food at good prices - most of the entrees are in the $7.95 to $11.95 range.
Glad to have this establishment here, especially since I'm in the Melrose District often.

A smooth club promoter named Emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us.

Now...

I am a champagne lush. I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.

So after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.

I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.

It was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. 

For any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.

Also, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. 

When we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. 

I personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.

The night is hot and sticky. The streets of old town have an eerily abandoned feeling as we realize it's 9pm on a Friday night and we are the only pedestrians around. Even in a sundress and sandals, I feel my skin glow with perspiration. After a bit of wandering, we realize we might be lost when I see a corridor lined with vines and trellises and my intuition and sense of adventure tells me to follow it. I grab his hand and lead the way blindly. He begins questioning my decision when I see a mysterious wooden door and before he can finish objecting we realize we found our way to the truth within. 

We step inside and it feels like we found the closet that leads to Narnia. We walk into another world. Another time. Relaxed sounds of jazz caress our ears as our eyes adjust to the darkness and candlelight. We take in the old world feel, the stone, the wood, the beautiful sleek bar...that seems to be beckoning us to sit. Couples and groups of friends absorbed in each other on cushy couches and stools all with a sense of privacy and feeling that there is no world outside of this place and there is no moment other than now. His eyes meet mine and we know this is exactly where we want to be.

As we settle in at the bar, helpful suggestions are ready when we ask. He orders for me, as only seems appropriate in this mysterious and romantic era. Pinot Noir, Cabernet, plates of pt, soppressata, brie, stilton white with cherries. I can taste the pure indulgence dripping off the mere words as they leave his mouth. The wine flows and the food is plentiful. Every sip, every bite, is something to savor and worthy of noting. Our conversation, whispers of love and beauty in each other's ears, lips close enough for a kiss. Knowledge of another world, remembrances of anyone else is lost as we fall under the spell that is Kazimierz. 

When the night is over and we have no choice but to go back to where we came from, we reluctantly step back out into the warm, heavy night air greeted by sounds of traffic and rickshaw drivers ringing their bells. But as we leave, we take with us a secret. A sexy, decadent, mysterious secret that lies behind an old wooden door in the heart of old town. 

The only way to discover that secret is to seek out that door and enter it yourself.

Mi Comida was the place picked for the International Supper Club UYE for September and I for one was excited to try them out!

As others have stated this place is small, and if you are in a hurry, then skip it all together.  With that being said, we all arrived around the same time, and Carlos, who I guess is the owner, waited on us, and I have to say Carlos was amazing, gave us all personal attention, took each person's order one at a time and yes the dishes came out that way as well. But I have to say this was one of the best dinning experiences I have had in a very long time. I enjoyed the fact that we were not rushed and that we all were able to carry on a conversation and enjoy some great food! So if you are not in a hurry and are looking for great personal service, this is your place!

I knew before I got there I wanted tamales! I have been craving tamales, but I didn't want the normal run of the mill tamales!  I ordered Tamale de papa, which on the menu said its made in the highlands of Ecuador, it was made with a potato cheese dough (hello this Irish girl loves potatoes!!) and it was filled with chicken, veggies and a slice of chorizo wrapped in a banana leaf, it was pretty darn tasty! Really enjoyed it!

I also ordered the Pastel Crillo De Pollo - chicken, veggies and aji chilli wrapped inside a pastry puff, this too was delish!!    I crave/love spicy foods, and Carlos brought out some aji sauce and said that it was spicy, for me, it was lacking the heat, but made up for the amazing flavor it had. That stuff is delish! 

Impeccable service, excellent food, amazing company, hope to be back soon!

Fry's is one of the Kroger brand stores and it is clearly their best.

Every so often, we will pick up a few bottles of wine and grab one of those ecological friendly bags.  I took the time recently and noticed that they have printed all the Kroger stores on it's side.  Clearly someone in Kroger HQ was thinking beyond their area.  Realizing, that having one bag for all their stores, would save money and promote brand awareness.  Well, it did.

Turkey Hill, Smith's, Ralph's, QFC, Fred Meyer, Payless, City Market and Fry's.  These are all of the Kroger stores we've been lucky to shop in over several relocations, and they're all very good individually.  Fry's and this store in particular, seems to be the best!  

In the short five years we've been in Arizona, this store has had several updates. The books and magazine area was updated four years ago and then again recently. Same thing for the convenience food.  Three times in five years.  Now, they have a wine tasting, sushi maker on hand, bar area -- which is always packed!  At least a dozen shoppers watching a flat screen TV, drinking wine and eating some personally made sushi and pot stickers.  WOW!

This would all be a sidebar, if their prices weren't competitive.  And how do I know their competitive?  Because mammoth Walmarts is now airing TV commercials against Fry's and saying theirs prices are lower.  Incredible!  Who ever heard of Walmarts airing commercial against one competitor!  One competitor. Think about it for a moment.  

As our YCM Lindsey F wrote fourteen months ago: "Holy grocery store! I don't even know if the term grocery store can be applied to this Fry's. Imagine Target, Costco, AJ's, Fry's, Walgreens and Whole Foods all piled into one overwhelming massive store."  Our family agrees and we haven't even mentioned their $0.10 off a gallon of gas/diesel tie-in with Circle K or Shell.  So, why shop anywhere else?

A shout-out to Jeff in Bakery, Donnie in Checkout and Gloria in Deli.  They are friendly, helpful and willing to go out of their way to get you whatever you want!  Did I mention their great customer service?

Okay, I'm a Fan!  And, this is: "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Five Stars.

How can anyone complain about the ONLY service I'm aware of here in Vegas that will deliver food to you, while you dictate from your living room dressed in nothing but panties?

Really? I'm sorry y'all. I'm not following you here! You have a better solution, let me know. For now, all of my bets and money are with Road Runner Food on this one... For their excellent service and price for what they offer, I am truly a fan.

If it wasn't for them, I would have never gotten my ROTD on Yelp for reviewing Amore Taste of Chicago Pizza. Roadrunner was singlehandedly responsible for introducing me to this amazing restaurant. I always give credit where credit is due, and it is is definitely due here. All of this transpired from the comfort of my own home, while surfing the net in my panties. And yes, I'm gladly putting my own name and rep on the line by telling you that Roadrunner really rocks! I cannot stress this enough!

Sure, I have to put clothes on to answer the door but who cares? I still got to order in my panties and I relish in that fact! And to think that I just killed every guy's fantasy about delivering the "extra large sausage pizza" to my house in those last few sentences. Haha! I'm sorry.

Special thanks to Vicki for handling my order and making my day. This girl definitely deserves a raise! *a little hint hint nudge nudge for the higher ups that may be reading this*

LOVE The Barrymore!! What a hidden gem and one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas! I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.

Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.

The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, 
peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though.
Book a table here and thank me later!

The lunch specials are great here! I had the "Pineapple Chicken" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The "Egg Drop Soup" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free "Egg Rolls" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. 

I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some "Fried Wontons" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!

They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm.

Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For "shareable",  respectable "sashimi won-taco" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The "fondue dippers" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A "big dipper" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The "off-da-hook smash burger" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the "mac-n-cheese bacon burger"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.

Their extravagant looking confections and pastries have a tendency to draw visitors in.  That was certainly the case several years ago when I visited their location inside the Bellagio.  This was the second time I've stopped at their newer location inside Aria, but this was the first time I purchased something.

While my buddies were losing their hard earned wages on gaming devices and eye-candy dealers I decided to indulge in another sort of eye-candy taking a mid-day break here snapping photos of Christmas themed confections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=DELXUM9BD2s0h4e37_gt5Q) and sitting down with an iced mocha (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=95AhWqWjCtxG36p8nBq7xg) and a slice of cake.

I chose the Opera cake slice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=p5YuhVtND3noJCQ6mwU9tA) made up of liqueur-soaked sponge cake, coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache because it seemed like a safer selection than any of the other 20+ varieties of individual cakes, tarts, napoleons and mousses, and I really needed a shot of caffeine from staying up late the previous night and not catching up on my z's in the hours that passed.  I'm normally not a coffee drinker, but I do turn to it rather than to instant energy products.

Maybe because my choice was safe, but the cake slice did not wow me at all.  The flavors all meshed together quite well, but there was no particular component to the dessert that gave it any "oomph."  This was just a sweet slice of cake with, really, nothing special to it.  The cocoa covered truffle that sat atop the cake had an unusually thick shell and the center wasn't as smooth and sensuous as some mass-produced truffles I've sampled.  I actually enjoyed the bitterness and cold from my iced mocha more than I did the cake.

Maybe it was better this way.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas and I walk past their beautiful desserts I know to treat it like I treat other eye candy.  It's better not to sample no matter how delicious or tantalizing they seem to be!

October 15, Florida stone crab season OPEN!  Crab lovers rejoice!

Why?  Simple; sweeter than an lobster, tender, juicy, never stringy meat.  Dip them in a tangy mustard concoction and it's fireworks in your mouth.

The facts:
- Available October 15 - May 15.
- Sold by size (medium, large, jumbo, colossal), price increases with size.
- Size matters for texture not sweetness.  Buy the largest you can afford.
- 2013 harvest starting at the lowest in history.  Astronomical prices ($12/claw large, $25/ claw jumbo).

For other menu items, stick to basics; KISS.  Great place for a casual, shared meal with friends.  Solid preparations for grilled lobster tails, steamed jumbo Alaskan king crab legs, classic oysters Rockefeller, and pan seared diver scallops.  The colossal lump crab cake excellent, moist, sweet.  Almost all crab with lumps sticking out in all directions.  Pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  

Good selection of steaks.  Two grades, USDA choice Angus and USDA prime.  All prime cuts are bone in.  Cuts are gently trimmed leaving some of the outer fat in tact.  Old school, fat is flavor style.   Even grilling and cooked to temperature.  It's beef, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

Diverse side meant to be shared.  The grilled tomatoes are the perfect foil for the stone crabs.  Tart, acidic, blistered and  just warmed through.  

Save a little room for dessert.  Home made key lime pie.  They are known for it.  One of the best examples I've ever had.

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Whites perfectly target the clean seafood flavors from Spain, France, Italy and New Zealand.  Modest (2x-2.5x retail), Vegas resort pricing.

Casual, friendly, efficient service.

Seven sinful months in Sin City never tasted so good.

You know how it is when you live in Vegas -- everyone comes to visit, and expects you to take them someplace "cool." Pressure!

Yesterday I had two different friends in town, who both wanted a piece of me. One is a 7-months-pregnant Conservative Christian from Arkansas, and the other is a traveling art-nude model with a wild '70s bush and a predilection for men 40+ years her senior. Where to take them that would appeal to both??

I wanted someplace fun, unpretentious and off-Strip (both of my friends have the good sense to despise the overpriced pretentiousness of places with all-caps names like MIX, STACK, FIX, DOUCHE...oh wait, the Health Dept. shut that one down). 

Anyhoo, I asked around and finally lit on Bar + Bistro...which turned out to be AWESOME! This was in the middle of the humid monsoon season (8.1.11), but we sat on their fabulous patio anyway -- and it was GREAT! They have a huge patio all strung up with Christmas lights, facing out onto Charleston Blvd...but it's not loud at all, and very pleasant. 

I always go for atmo over food quality...but it wasn't just the atmo that was kickass here -- every single thing we ordered was FANTASTIC! I had the chopped Latin salad (delish and filling), my girlfriends had paella (bomb) and pizza mergherita (ditto), plus we split an order of mahi mahi tacos (fabulous) and the lavash/hummus they brought us was also incredible. I really can't speak highly enough of the food here...and the prices were totally reasonable.

The waitstaff was super badass, too. One of the waiters, a super cool guy named Arash, even came and had a beer with us. We had a total blast, and this was on a Monday night when the place was totally dead! I can only imagine how much fun it is during First Friday or their Saturday night poetry jam. 

I will DEFINITELY be coming back here!

P.S. They also have a fairly extensive tapas menu...and I recommend this place a thousand times over Firefly. MUCH better atmo.

This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub. 

We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus. 

The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside. 

Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there. 

The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food. 

Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo. 

The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL. 

We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay

Grassroots rates 3 1/2 stars for me but I'll round up with 4 stars for this review. They serve the beer ice cold which I love. I started off with the appetizer of the pulled pork sliders which were delicious. For the main course I had the sliced brisket with some funky side to it which was forgettable as far as I'm concerned. They don't give you enough BBQ Sauce so you have to ask for more. The brisket was just okay for me, and for what they were charging it should have tasted much better.

The service was decent. This place is a great alternative if you ever get stuck waiting in line at that hip pizza place across the way. I would definitely come back and try some other menu items. Just when I thought it was safe to carry the Discover Card I find out that this place doesn't accept it. I think the Discover Card was rolled out in the mid 1980's. Hey Grassroots, if you want to be that upscale and sophisticated go to restaurant and bar then you'll have to accept all major credit cards.

This is where we met up to start our taco trek UYE and the best of our stops in my opinion. I was so impressed watching them making fresh flour tortillas right on the truck! Nice! The line was long at Sinaloa so I found that to be a good sign. Sinaloa offers a variety of tacos, burritos, mulitas, tortas and quesadillas. Here are some of the current prices:

*Tacos*
- Asada (beef), Al Pastor (marinated pork), Cabeza (head), Chorizo (pork beef) are $1.50 each 
- Lengua (tongue), Tripa ( intestines) are $2 each.  

*Burritos, Tortas and Quesadillas* 
- Regular $5
- Lengua $6.50
- Tripa $6.50

I decided to try a "Al Pastor Taco" and after ordering it took about 10 minutes for my taco. They make everything you order from scratch so it might take an extra minute, but it is worth it. The fresh tortilla is worth it alone! The pastor had great flavor. My hubby noticed the condiment bar (salsas, sliced cucumber, etc.) right next to where you order, but I didn't see it! I think there were too many people standing in front of it for me to notice. While I watched my hubby make a Mexican flag with sauce across his 2 tacos, I was glad to just have the cilantro/onion mix on my taco. The pastor had such good flavor that it really didn't need anything more then a good fresh tortilla wrapped around it. 

They have Coca-Cola in glass bottles (score!) and there is even a hot dog cart right next to the truck. I don't get the hot dog cart, but there were a decent amount of kids eating hot dogs so whatever works!

Upscale gourmet burger places are popping up all over the Valley.  Except this one is different!

I could write about how they are better than Coal Burger(?), Five Guys or ZinBurgers, but why do that -- since they did a much better job:

"While most people are eating breakfast, we''re already doing lunch -- shaping fresh 100% Certified Angus Beef into plump meatballs.  (When was our beef frozen, by the way?  Try never.)

"Why meatballs, not patties?  Because unlike the other burger places, we don''t squish.  We smash.  Place your order and we spring into action, painting the grill with real butter, adding a dash of our secret spice blend, and smashing the meatball with a tool we invented ourselves (it''s so new, it doesn''t even have a name -- let''s just call it the smashing tool).

Okay, their corporate marketing aside, we had a very nice time here yesterday.  One of us ordered the large Smashburger Arizona, with Habanero cheese, quacamole, jalapeos on their spicy chipotle bun for $6.99(photo), along with the French Fries for $2.29(photo).  Ohh, was that good!

We also ordered the large Mushroom Swiss Smashburger for $6.99, and the Haystack Onions for $2.29.  Everything was outstanding and yummy.  

Yummy? Yes, yummy!  Like, why waste your time going somewhere else yummy!  Oh, yeah the bill for two came to $22.  Did I mention that Smashburger was an upscale gourmet burger place?  But that did include drinks and some sides.

I know that might be too Richie Rich$$ for some, so you can drive down FLW to In 'n Out and order it Animal Style.  But if you do, you will be missing an outstanding and delicious burger!  LOL

Enjoy!

From the Italian powerhouses Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich  comes... a burger joint???

How does it stack up?  Accepting that Hubert Keller's Burger Bar with it's selection of top grade beef and well prepared, gourmet toppings is the supreme high end burger and Bachi Burger at the other extreme for delicious creativity, B&B Burger fits right in the middle.  (Sorry, clowns and kings don't even count as food in this burger arena).

Breaking it down, the burgers are firm and juicy, with a good blend of different cuts of beef, aggressively seasoned, cooked to temperature with a good outer sear.  Small selection of well made toppings (sauted mushrooms, fried egg, avocado, caramelized onion), decent selection of cheeses, great sauces (jalapeno pesto, balsamic mustard, Chianti mustard, garlic aioli, truffle aioli).

Order as a "build your own" or from preconceived selections that feature "The Drive-Thru" (take on In-n-Out's burger, griddled patties with processed American cheese on a sesame bun in a paper wrapper)  slumming it on the Strip or a great "Morning After" (sauted mushrooms, Fontana, egg, truffle aioli and frisee) AKA Midwest heart attack.  Both are good eats, classic, comforting.

A selection of Heroes for the non burger eaters.  The crispy cod is very good.  Deep fried, crisp, moist cod with a refreshing slaw and spicy jalapeno tartar.

OK sides.  Chips crisp and flavorful, onion rings, sweet with a crisp coating, fried pickles good acid but excessive coating makes them oily.

Service not perfect but Strip friendly.  Well chosen selection of craft beers.  Vegas resort pricing.

The average tab, just ONE green check.  Hey, you're in the Venetian.

For my 125th, 5 Star Review I wanted to share a gastropub located in the V.  I had heard a lot about this place, and I like gastropubs so I said I gotta check this place out.  We ordered a light meal consisting of: 

Bone marrow ($15) w/ bacon & onion marmalade; Grilled octopus ($16) w/ fried chickpeas, chorizo, saffron-romanesco sauce & arugula; and Duck confit poutine ($11) w/ cheese curds, gravy & egg ($2.50 extra).

The marrow was excellent.  It was completely edible vs some places where all the marrow does not come off the bone.  It was nicely seasoned and the marmalade and bread were also excellent too:  5 Stars.  The octopus was outstanding.  It was way better than recently reviewed Black Hogg in Silverlake (LA).  The octopus was super tender, and the fried chickpeas and chorizo added texture and contrast to the octopus:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the poutine was the star of the evening and the perfectly cooked egg put this dish over the top!  The dish was nice sized, the fries were still crispy, and there wasn't too much gravy (poured on at the table).  This version was way better compared to Animal in LA:  5+++ Stars.

To drink, we had the Joseph James lager ($8) and a Speakeasy ($10).  The former is like a Stella (my go to beer), but w/ more malt.  The latter is a Belgian style beer, but not as sweet as some:  5 Stars for both.

Nicholas was an awesome bartender!  Not only did he introduce us to some new beers, he was also very knowledgable about the menu.  Lastly, he poured a tequila shot down the finished bone marrow for one patron.  The patron said he really liked it!  - 5 Stars.

The ambiance was very nice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  The clientele were chill, and there was a whimsical sign by the bathroom:  5 Stars.

I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas to try more dishes, or have the dishes we enjoyed on this trip.  I would prefer to come here vs the overrated Delmonicos.

Now that a week has gone by, I feel I can write this review and not become unhinged. My beloved cat Pepper, who was my constant companion for the last 2 years, spent last weekend at this Emergency Animal Clinic. Our regular vet told us to bring him here as it was the 24-hour animal hospital closest to our home. It turned out he had a very serious bladder stone condition, and come Monday, when we were able to see our regular vet, we made the heart-breaking decision that putting him down was the best thing to do. 

However, if the staff at this EAC had managed to give us all the information they had, we might have been able to save Pepper a lot of pain and misery sooner and maybe us hundreds if not thousands of dollars. First of all, this place is ghetto. Nothing about the appearance and upkeep inspires any confidence. Secondly, they have rotating doctors and technicians, so you are always talking to someone new. And everyone has a different opinion, and most of them were inconsistent with what our vet told us in the end. The reception area staff was unprofessional. The first girl we spoke to stammered over how to ask when Pepper had last urinated or defecated. Um... how about learning and using appropriate terminology? The person entering my information transposed 2 of the numbers of my cell phone number. No wonder they had to call my husband instead. I verbally corrected it with them over the phone, but when we went in later that day, they still had not changed it on Pepper's  paperwork, so we took out a pen and fixed it ourselves. They neglected to call us when Pepper's urethra blocked yet again within the first 12 hours. They neglected to call us when his temperature spiked again and he became agitated. They said they told my husband the results of his blood tests over the phone, but he does not recall hearing that information. They did let us come see him several times, and while we were waiting to be led back to the cages, we were regaled with loud and stupid personal conversations, that apparently the staff did not care that the rest of us in the waiting room could hear. It just pissed me off that we were all in life-and-death situations and they were all into their petty gossiping. Not that I expect a medical practice to be a somber graveyard, but appropriate conversation at an appropriate volume would simply show respect for the clientele. 

When I told my boss, a fellow cat lover and downtown resident, what happened, she said that she too had once taken a cat to this EAC in an emergency. It was having severe upper respiratory problems, and they were having some trouble getting it out of its carrier. So instead of getting my boss to see if she could coax it out, they tied a rope around its neck. Around the neck of a cat who couldn't breathe. She took the cat somewhere else immediately.

I will also never go here again in an emergency, and have since spoken to a number of people who have given me other options should I find myself in need of immediate after hours care. Our bill (which had to be pre-paid, mind you) was nearly $2000. Outrageous indeed.

Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22

Let me start by answering your questions;

"No" and "No."

For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. 

Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!

I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. 

Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. 

For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. 

So now for your questions;
Was it worth it? NO
Would we go back? NO

PS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[

This place is great. I can't believe I've never been here before. I've been severely missing out. Old Vegas charm meets unglamorous dive bar. Perfection. This place gets it. 

Liam (Door staff) is one of the most genuinely nicest guys in town. He proves that you don't have to be a douche to control the door. **Other bars take note!!
I was told it's the oldest bar in Vegas, but technically there's a bar that's been open (consecutively) longer. I haven't been to that bar either, so as far as I'm concerned this is the oldest. I love the old style memorabilia. Bathrooms are surprisingly clean. 
This place rocks! Drinks are cheap and delicious. I was a little hesitant to order a dirty martini in a such a distinct dive bar, but I couldn't stop my mouth from saying the words. Not to worry, because it came out perfect. Absolutely perfect. 

Everyone is extremely friendly. Our waitress was adorable and attentive. She told me her name, but of course I forgot.

Patio:  Unfortunately the view isn't that great.. right now you are just facing a dirt lot, but it's still spacious and nice to have the option.  

Pros: Bike rake. I'm new to biking, so I'm on the lookout for downtown bars with bike racks. 

I didn't see a liquor store section, but apparently you can buy some of the bottles from behind the bar.

Our first 10 seconds in this place set the tone for our meal there... We walked in and were told to go order from the bar. Went to the bar to order and were told we needed to be ID'd bc we were at the bar, even though we had no plans on drinking and were just there to order. It was 2pm. Huh? Kinda weird. 

But what the hell, since we were at the bar anyway and I saw Ayinger Bru Weisse on the menu (spelled incorrectly), I ordered a brew. What came out was Anchor Steam Christmas Ale. Not. Even. Close. I get that they both start with 'A', but a bartender should know the menu. Strike 1. We order our food and move to a table. The table we sit at is so off kilter that one elbow on it made my beer spill out and all over my phone. Strike 2. 

The buzzer goes off and we go pick up our food. My gf's salad looked decent, but had a spicy dressing on it that wasn't listed on the menu. Like a good boyfriend, I didn't trust her tastebuds and tried it myself. It 100% had a kick. She went to return it and didn't get a full tude, but def a nice 'wtf' stare from the chef. The salad was remade and brought out with a new dressing only it lacked the avocado that we paid extra for and the chicken was way undercooked. Strike 3. 

For my meal, a half Cubano and soup combo, the soup looked like something you would be served in an airplane... flying coach. Progresso in a square plastic bowl. Eek. Saving grace? The Cubano was good! Would a full one be worth $12? NO. It's not a large 'wich at all. $12 can get you a yard of meats at Capriotti's. Instead, I recieved canned soup and half a sammie for that same amount. Weak. Strike 4. 

I want to 2-star it bc it wasn't the worst place out there and it's certainly appealing to the eyes, but I know deep down that in no way will I be back. 'Methinks not' is spot on.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

The park looks small, and there are few amenities offered.

TIPS:
1. Complimentary towels are not offered to anyone; this includes gold pass holders and cabana guests. Bring your own.
2. There are VERY few lounge chairs available. Most are in cabana areas, you are expected to bring your own. You are able to bring your own lounge chairs.
3. If you went to Wet'n'Wild years ago, you'll be disappointed by the few rides that are available here. The size of the park is 1/4-1/2 the size of the original. Good news is that they have plenty of room to expand.
4. No outside food or drink is welcomed. This includes bottled waters. Call ahead to bring in food for any family members with food allergies and make sure you get the name of management that pre-authorizes your home brought lunch.
5. Very few areas for shade. Bring an umbrella.
6. Don't forget to bring a couple extra towels for your family and plenty of sunscreen!!
7. Leave your inner tubes at home, they aren't allowed even on the lazy river. They provide life jackets for younger children that may not be able to fit comfortably into rental tubes.
8. GET THERE EARLY IF YOU WANT TO RENT A TUBE! They go VERY fast, after 5 minutes of doors being open- they're gone.

Overall, this water park doesn't appear to be a full day event unless you have very young children. 6 hours is probably the max I'd stay, and that would give you time to ride most of the rides. 

Food offerings include Oasis cafe, Agave Grill, Dip'n'Dots, Auto Creamery, Fresh'n'Go Market, and Snowie.

I have been a fan of Dan's food since the last place he was at.  When word came out that he was going to open a new place, I immediately started daydreaming on how long it would take to open.  I'll be the first to admit that I was very let down by the time it took to open Mucho Macho Taco(MMT).  Well guess what...you can't rush perfection!  First things first, this is not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  MMT is a Mexican fusion restaurant.  The combination of traditional Mexican dishes with a clever injection of culinary magic makes you feel as if you had discovered an extra sense you never knew you had!

Horchata...best I have tasted in Phoenix hands down!  Dan found a way to take his original recipe and kick it up a few notches(the dates that top this drink is a great touch).  I challenge my fellow Yelpers to point out a better tasting horchata in the Phoenix area.

Skirt Steak Taco...basically a carne asada taco that is so tender and has mastered this taco staple. 

50/50 Taco...it is a Skirt Steak Taco mixed with a locally sourced Chorizo that is greaseless and savory.  

Crispy Fish Taco...a Baja California favorite that Dan already had down pat!  I am not able to pinpoint what Dan and crew did differently here but they knocked this fish taco out the park.

Roasted Turkey Mole Taco...I had a mouth orgasm with this one!  They dominated a perfect smoke flavor along with celery and mole sauce.  I recommend that everyone taste this taco!

Braised Brisket Taco...this brisket is tender, moist and flavorful.  The union of the brisket, orange segments and cilantro truly packs a wallop to your taste buds.  

Bacon Taco...who will argue that anything with bacon taste bad?  A non-Merican that's who!  This locally sourced bacon tastes heavenly.  

Sopapillas...a appetizing dessert you find at most Mexican joints.  MMT has topped theirs off with an authentic cajeta, Mexican chocolate and pecans.  I don't eat flour but had to have a couple pieces of these sopapillas, well worth the stomach cramps!

I truly wish Dan and crew much success!  The first weekend that Mucho Macho Taco was open, it already appears that they have a contender for a title fight!

This review is for the 2012 Electric Daisy Carnival at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  They should have called it the Electric Daisy Clusterfuck.  Nothing good can come out of 200,000+ people on drugs trying to figure anything out.  Here are a list of the pros and cons of the event:
PROS:
There were a lot of cool things to look at, including parades, rides, lights, and art installations.
Despite huge crouds, I did not personally witness any violence or riot behavior.

People were pretty chilll
CONS:

Traffic was a huge clusterfuck.  It took us 2 hours to drive the 20 miles to the venue on Friday, and 3 hours on Saturday.  

LInes to get in were also long and out of control.  We were sent to three different lines from staff when they told us to "go to the next gate, there is no line".  On the way, other ravers were walking toward us, claiming they were told the same thing.  

There was clearly no communication between staff members.

Hope you're not a fan of toilet paper or washing your hands after using a tiolet shared with tens of thousands of people.  The sanitation conditions are horrific.  

Not a single event staff member knew where water stations, bathrooms, lockers, first aid, or parking lots were located.  After each time we asked a staff member a question (like, which way to Lot 9?  Where are the lockers?  Where is the nearest water refill station?) we were met with an apathetic, "I don't know..."

Las Vegas PD clearly turned a blind eye to those who were endangering themselves and others- While stuck in traffic on the way to the LVMS, I saw TWO trucks with passengers riding in the bed of the truck drinking.  These people were not pulled over by police, which made me nervous as to what else was going on in plain sight.  I'm not stupid, I know that people go to these events to party and do drugs, but it scares me to think that there are people blatantly endangering themselves and others and no one is doind anything about it. 

The fact that the event was shut down at 1 am on Saturday didn't contribute to this shitty one star reivew- it is because of the obvious greed exhibited by Insomniac and Pasqual Rotella to oversell a venue to almost 300.000 people promising that it will be a safe experience.  I feel like they took our money and then said, "Thanks, and fuck you" since it was clear that there was no training what so ever for event staff, nor did they seem like they cared at all about any of us.  Personally, I will NEVER attend another Insomniac event.  Someone was injured Sunday night in an accident which is unforutnate, but I am glad (and surprised) that there were no deaths this year.  Fuck you, Insomiac, you selfish rat bastards.  

TLDR: Don't waste your money or time on this clusterfuck of an event.  Bottom line: I felt UNSAFE and taken advantage of during the entire experience.

The 9th Island:  Portuguese sausage, spam, jalapeos, pineapple and mozzarella pizza?  I'm so there!

Enter Buddha Belly Deli.  Aside from the odd tribute to Hawaii, essentially a mish mash of Asian flavors creating new Asian comfort food in Hendertucky.  And it's good.

In general, individual components to each dish are well made with the slightly over pronounced flavors.  Dishes lean towards South East Asia but with well controlled spice heat.  A series of house made chili sauces and concoctions can definitely make dishes thermonuclear without masking flavor if desired.

The pho dip lives up the hype.  A banh mi dipped in a flavorful beef pho broth.  Fresh baked roll loaded with five spice rubbed, rare, sliced beef and just the right amount of still crisp pickled been sprouts onions cilantro and basil slathered with hot, pungent Chinese mustard.  Simply put great eats.  The char siu pork roll equally good.  Juicy but not excessively fatty char siu topped with an Asian slaw and hoisin on a sweet bun.  Need I say more.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a side of their house made chips that provide a great textural contrast and neutrality between bites of the flavorful offerings.

A very good clam.  Basically tom yum kung with clams.  Aromatic, herbaceous, rich and warming.

The fries topped with Japanese curry (no coconut milk or aggressive spices of Indian curry) and a fried egg and strips of nori (laver), is and outstanding take on the Midwest classic.  Creamy, messy, and just plain good.

Finally, dragon breath fries.  Not spicy but a good wallop of garlic will remind you of its goodness for hours.

Although not destination worthy from the Strip, a great neighborhood, locals kind of fast food restaurant with a very friendly staff.

I remember when we went here for the first time
Saying "This is it! I'm gonna eat some chocolate so prime!"
This place is in the left wing of Caesar's Forum Shops
On our four-day trip this was one of our scheduled stops
Greeted on a semi-crowded Tuesday night, nicely
Seated to the souvenir shop's left and kitchen's right, precisely
We looked at the menu and were astounded by the selection
We needed someone to point us in the right direction

And ooooooooooh...I didn't listen to the waitress' recommendation (about maybe not getting the sampler)
And ooooooooooh...I better listen next time, I'm telling you
If we ever ever ever go back to Vegas we should remember
That we will get together together together with Max Brenner
We'll order the O.M.G. cookie
Order the milkshakes
Order food savory
So we may get together together together again with Max Brenner

"But shouldn't every chocolate dessert be 5-star here?", I think
And shouldn't all the flavors in their sampler be clear, and in sync
And while the milk and white chocolate bark "branches" were exciting
And the chocolate sauce and chocolate wafer balls made the ice cream inviting
The banana tempura had a strange batter and aftertaste
And the chocolate sponge cake had no chocolate flavor, what a waste
And while the waffle with fruit made me somewhat happy
The next morning I had a much better waffle with fruit at Mon Ami Gabi

And while the fondue was nice, it didn't fill my chocolate wish
They had to start the marshmallow grill flame twice because once it did extinguish
But however ever ever disappointed I was by this endeavor
I don't know if we'll sever sever sever our ties to Max Brenner
While we liked the bark branch
Liked the fondue
Liked the ice cream
We may never ever ever go back to Max Brenner 

And while the waitress was bubbly and endearing and sweet
The management had her working too many tables; she looked flustered and beat

While the concept is a clever clever clever cocoa endeavor
Should we ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner?
(Yelpers, please let me know if I should ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner!)

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

One of the best sushi places I've had! Location is a little strange and out of the way but well worth it. Yelpers were spot on with their raving reviews of Goyemon. The inside was very nice and clean and didn't smell :) It was a packed house which is always a good sign of a great establishment. We sat at the sushi bar and Ivan, our sushi chef was amazing. Of course we ordered the AYCE. Loved the fact we can order 1/2 rolls so we could try lots of different items. The nigiri was the perfect bite size. We enjoyed the Hurricane, garlic tuna, masago with quail egg, and I also tried the 911...spicy habanero HELL! We made friends with nearby patrons & started sharing but none of them dared to try the 911. I couldn't feel my face after eating it, thank goodness for the nearby sugar packets to help put out the heat.
To finish our meal, lychee sherbet...refreshing and light.
Definitely at the top of our list for sushi.

Note: I rated this one-star because I can't give it less.

My wife Jill and I went to this at ten this morning.  First, let's talk about how we almost didn't make it because Hero Ventures and TicketMaster never got their act together.  When they postponed opening the event for a week, we did not get any information about our NEW tickets.  All they did was mention that we could bring a friend for free.  All that this did was add to the total number of disappointed attendees today.

We arrived and were very much surprised by a heretofore unmentioned charge for parking.  Not once was it referenced in any of the communications, or on the page for the event.  Ten additional dollars poorer, we then waited for thirty to forty five minutes, in the sun, while other attendees tried futilely to register their less than useless tracker bracelets.  The wait would still have been a long time, even if EVERYONE had pre-registered, because none of the pre-registration credentials were being recognized.  However, the wait was even LONGER because only fifty five to sixty percent of the kiosks were working, and only forty five to fifty of them working completely.

We were then treated to spending huge amounts of time standing and waiting.  The shortest wait, after the registration debacle, was twenty minutes before getting to the "Interactive" area.  This consisted mostly of cheesy games (more at home at Castles and Coasters than a groundbreaking technological marvel) that had simply been reskinned with Marvel characters. But, most of the Marvel Experience was the waiting.  Waiting for the "3-D" and the "4-D" experiences.  Both of these were notable lacking in at least one advertised dimension. The 3-D Projection wasn't even working, so the glasses they handed us were handed right back.  This after a forty five to fifty minute wait.  The wait to go from the "3-D" part to the "4-D" ride was only twenty to twenty five minutes... But, also NO 3-D!!!

So we spent two and a half hours getting less than half of what we paid for.  The only thing this had in common with Marvel was the name, as well as the waiting that Marvels dedicated fans do.  But, at least that waiting pays off in dividends of great comics, movies and TV series.  The "Marvel Experience" was the waiting but, it was only followed by profound disappointment.

Also, the staff couldn't have been more disorganized and I'll-informed if they were the voting public.

This event was an over-hyped, under-delivered, bad faith rip-off.  We will pursue this as far as we need to get resolution.  I can't get the time from my limited life back that was wasted this morning back from them but, they can sure as Hell give me back my money.

Last minute decision to finally drive to Montreal brought me to Hotel10 - thank you hoteltonight app. (I mean it was either that or watch Honeymooners reruns all weekend - Montreal won).

The location is perfect - walking distance from old town and port, right next to St Laurent with all its restaurants and bars, and close to St Denis if you want to do some shopping.

Design is modern chic, which I always loved. 
Complimentary bath robe, oversized rain umbrella and huuuuge shower are big plus. Keurig coffeemaker in the room is cool too.
It also pretty quiet - polished concrete ceilings (darn kewl), carpeted floors, and covered walls - good soundproofing. I saw college kids with party supplies go to room next door and was prepared for much noise - did not hear a peep.

Garage parking is convenient, and I am tipping my hat to most awesome valet. 
Free wifi - good speed.
Huge gym room, clean, spotless, with fresh towels and ice cold water.

Breakfast is Ok-ish, I rather prefer eating elsewhere. 
However, Jargo lounge at night is pretty decent to grab a drink or dinner.

One word to management and my only disappointment - is how they maintain it. Carpets on ground level need cleaning, headboards need to be dusted, and hairdryer bags need to be cleaned. I don't enjoy finding other peoples hair there.

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.

Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.

I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.

I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.

Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.

For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...

OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.

And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.

Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.

All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.

P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

Let me start by saying I am in NO way a strip club rookie. I live for titties in my face and ass on my lap. This is probably my 15th visit here and I am finally getting time to review. The club isn't the biggest or the most lavish but let me tell you it's down to earth and that's why it gets a solid 5 star. 

If you are planning on visiting the rhino start with calling them at 702-796-3600 to get a FREE limo ride to the club. YES FREE. Save yourself 20 bucks cover at the door and give it to the limo driver who deserves it. Once you walk in you see the dimly lit stages and a bar. Drinks are a tad overpriced but its Vegas and tits are in your face. 10 bucks for a corona, also do yourself a favor and get the chicken strips. I am not messing around when I say they are REALLY good. 

I got here around 4am and the place was PACKED. At least a 1:1 ratio. The girls are not super aggressive like other people say. I took 2 females of my own and they loved the place. They thought it was full of dirty old men looking at ass but was pleasantly surprised when they could walk around, drink and mingle with all the other patrons. Dances are 20 bucks on the floor and of course tip the ladies. Nothing but good vibes. SOLID 5 STAR

LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

Great Casino Buffet Restaurant & FREAKIN LIONS

SITREP

Every time I pop into the MGM Grand Hotel, it's a fun casual experience.

THE SETUP

I love their dining buffets because they are quick & efficient.  Lunch runs $19.99.  Dinner runs $29.99.  (I never do both on the same day since I eat like it's my only meal of the day!)

LIONS! 

The LIONS in their large area are fun to watch interact with one another and the people.  They bring a LOT of spectators who are fascinated by being so close to observe them.  But part of me feels this is not kind to them.  So I am conflicted about this to be honest.  [Update:  see note at bottom of this review about the Lions new whereabouts]  :D

SHUTTLE PICK-UP

MGM Grand is also one of the major drop-off and get-on locations for catching shuttles back and forth from Mc Carran airport.  Great place to know.

THE LOWDOWN

My casual hotel run-in / grab a bite / run-out and hit the strip place.

ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Owner Response within 24 HRS

Here is one of two messages I just received in less than 24 hours from the MGM Owners Group.  You can't see this personal message below since it's in my Yelp inbox.  However, there is a 2nd message that shows up on the Business profile attached to my review (though these messages are not viewable from one's personal Yelp profile page).  A great response below to the Lion Issue.  Now that was unlooked for!  Message begins:

March 10, 2014

Social M.
Owner

Dear Michelangelo:

Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the MGM Grand Lion Habitat. 

The MGM Grand Lion Habitat closed as part of a property wide renovation project. Head trainer Keith Evans will continue to care for the lions at his large desert compound here in Southern Nevada, where the animals have actually spent the majority of their lives. Several years ago, MGM Grand and Mr. Evans established means to ensure that the lions will receive proper care for the rest of their lives.

The lion will remain an icon and logo forever associated with the MGM Grand brand.  We truly value your comments and patronage, and look forward to serving you again in the future.

Sincerely,

The Guest Experience Department
MGM Grand - Las Vegas

I'm not a gambler a drinker, so LV is not really my kind of town, unless I'm off the strip. The Rio is just that, a little of the strip and closer to where the locals go. 

Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a larger suite, SWEET!!!. The room was very nice, looked clean, didn't smell of yesterdays smoke, alcohol, or any flow play. The bed was a nice comfy size, king. Not sure why the t.v. is placed on the side wall, kind of difficult to watch in bed even have to do the head crank when seated on the couch, opposite the bed. 

The bathroom was fairly clean. I don't understand why hotels especially of such caliber don't wash their shower curtains. Upon inspection, I opened the curtain an almost hurled because of the sour smell the curtain spewed. It was nice to see that they automatically provided those little things you tend to forget, such as toothbrush, toothpaste and shower stuff. The vanity area is a bit odd, nice that there is a single cup coffee maker, but why put it on a shelf and one has to pull out and place on the vanity counter. Couldn't they just raise the shelf above to give the coffee maker enough room to open for water and the coffee packs? I was tempted. 

The casino itself is like any other, noisy and people everywhere. The downside is the HVAC. It must be the original unit since every time I walked out of the casino, I smelled of stale cigarettes. Yeah, I didn't spend much time there. I did, however, spend enough time to try their Pho restaurant. I will be writing a review for this place, so I won't say much here except, that was Pho? Blah. 

The room was nice and the price was good, should I go back to LV, I may consider staying here again.

Good food, okay service.

If you're looking for good authentic Asian food in the Venetian in Vegas, this is your place.  However, like many of the very authentic Asian restaurants, the service was completely lacking.  Our waitress visited our table only twice, once to take our order and the second time to bring the bill.  Otherwise a server brought our food, and no stopped by again to ask if we needed anything else. 

I tired to send back a plate because it wasn't what I wanted, and the hostess essentially told me "no", because they'd through the food away and it'd be wasted... so I just kept it and ate, but after a few more bites it wasn't all that bad after all  :-)

I guess what they lack in service they make up for in the food.

The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeos. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.

So hard including this name "Mon Ami Gabi" in our conversation
Frustrated friend: "Augh I don' t know, the Gabi thing in front!!"

Came here because
1) Right in front of our hotel
2) They specialize in slabs of cow :)***

I was very set on ordering the filet mignon with merlot butter once I skimmed the Yelp reviews and was told by our waitress that it was Mon Ami Gabi's house special.

By the way, we had the most thorough and humble waitress. She didn't constantly check on us, but made sure that the our food was delivered as ordered. 
She noticed that my girlfriend's cesar salad was dressed when she clearly said "dressing on the side," but my friend insisted it was okay. At the end, the waitress apologized as we got a free ice cream profiterole with hazelnut chocolate sauce. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=DVi5g-v4i81TzV_X5owU2g ..APOLOGY ACCEPTED!!

I would say the filet mignon was too legit (to quit), I know why they're known for it. It seemed to be cooked medium at first upon the sides, but later realized that toward the center it was medium rare as I requested. I expected the size to be "petit" but it was big enough for me to feel guilty for leaving some behind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=zxQGjORGM_oGCDJZX0IYNg

I wish they had better sides than the frites, they reminded me of chips. I prefer something creamier, less oily & fried things for my steak sides (heh).

Everyone else enjoyed their meal, and everyone was entertained/distracted by our friend trying to slice our table's loaf of house bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Z6_9c7qeqRbbY2VQX3im4g

A "Japanese" chain restaurant in cities Brentwood, Dubai, Glendale, Hollywood, Kuwait, LA, Las Vegas and South Beach; an NO location in Japan.  It speaks volumes.

Sarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.

Modern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  

In general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.

Creative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.

Nice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.

Forget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.

Well chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   

Good service but still showing the "green" uncertainty that will go away with time.

Definitely one of the better "interpretive" Japanese eateries in Vegas today.

I had a horrible experience at the Marquee Day Club with its small pool and their fantastic ability to stuff people in like sardines.

There's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good. 
Just grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music. 

If you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men. But generally, girls get in for $30 if you can't get in for the promotion price.

Oh, and if you're worried about fitting your lunch plans prior to pool time, they have a grill there that serves food.

Drinks are fairly expensive, as they regularly are in Las Vegas clubs.

The only thing to complain: I know the pools are heated, but the water is slightly too warm for the amount of people, which makes me think that the water is warm for other reasons :(

But I definitely would do this again on my next trip(s),

My favorite spot to chillax and unwind in Vegas! The only Korean spa in town, and they do a bang up job of keeping it awesome.

I've been here a few times in the past when I really need to get away. When the Groupon became available, I jumped at the opportunity. It may not look like much from the outside, but inside, it's high brow all the way.

After checkin, always make sure to give them your ID in order to get a pair of slippers to use around the gym. And shower before using the spa, hot tub, and before going upstairs to the communal area (and please dress in your given uniform before heading up!)

Upstairs in the communal area, there are a bunch of rooms heated to high temperatures to get you to sweat out the toxins. My favorite room is the one with the little balls that you can lie on! When it gets too hot, head on over to the ice room to cool off.

There are recliners and tv's where you can chill. In addition, there is a small cafe where you can buy food items. After sweating out a lot, I like to pass out on a recliner :D

Great fun, and you can stay from opening to closing if you want, but a few hours should be more then enough. Great to go with friends and family as well!!

The Human Bean is a tiny little building bursting with a variety of flavors. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the coffee here. My first visit I went with a hot "Snowy Chocolate" that the barista suggested. I thought the Snowy Chocolate tasted bland and watered down. I came back a couple days later to try something different and am glad I did because I ended up really liking it! I ordered a "Java Chip" blended and it tasted so good and they don't skimp at all on the chocolate chips! I loved it so much that I decided to cheat on Starbuck's the next morning before work and came here to get coffee instead. I had a BOGO coupon a co-worker gave me so I ordered a  "Salted Caramel Mocha" iced and a "Caramel Mocha" blended. The Salted Caramel Mocha was so-so while the Caramel Mocha blended was so good with ribbons of caramel throughout it and it just had a good taste. They have plenty of options when it comes to flavors, so I will be back to try out more! I was also given a punch chard where after I buy so many coffees I get one free. Also on Wednesday you get double punches! Nice! They have 2 drive-thrus with one on each side of the building and you can pull up to either of them. A nice touch is the chocolate covered espresso bean they put on top of each drink, it just completes the whole drink. The girls working here are very friendly and helpful with explaining all the drinks. Drinks range from around $2 - $5 depending on what you want and the size. Glad I tried The Human Bean!

I stayed here on 8/14/10. Like the other review says, the food is AWFUL, the accommodations are CRAP, and the ambiance leaves MUCH to be desired. 

What the other reviewer didn't mention is that the staff is rude beyond belief, and will make you feel like less than a speck of fly shit on a piece of dog shit. No matter how polite you are, it will not serve you one bit...so I recommend venting your anger by voicing your complaints.

Once I voiced my complaints, I was immediately surrounded and attended to by a host of staffers, who led me away into a more private room, where my only company was two crackheads and a drunken barefooted prostitute. But these new accommodations pleased me even less than the old ones. Thankfully, all it took was 4 hours of inconsolable weeping before they upgraded my room to a larger shared suite.

This new room was similarly lacking in ambiance and decor, but at least the company was good. Say what you will about the CCDC's amenities -- the place is ALWAYS packed! And not with just the regular Vegas nightclub crowd, either; during my stay I met a fascinating array of prostitutes, strippers and crackheads. (OK, maybe it WAS the regular Vegas nightclub crowd, now that I think about it.)

The highlight of my experience was befriending a genial middle-aged Asian stripper with a distinctive deformity whereby her hands were missing several fingers, so that they resembled lobster claws. 

"You dancer?" she asked me. 
"No," I replied. 
"Why no?! You so preeeeetty!"
"I'd LIKE to be a dancer," I answered honestly; "I know the money's great... but I'm the world's WORST dancer, and I'd be laughed out of the club!"
"No honey; it eeeeeasy! I show you!"

And so it came to pass that I was the recipient of a lap dance in the holding tank of the CCDC by a lobster-clawed middle-aged Asian woman who had been arrested on charges of domestic violence (she beat up her husband, LOL). Amazing!

"Where did you say you danced again? Spearmint Rhino?!" I found this hard to believe, since supposedly those are the hottest dancers in Vegas.

"Yeah, Spearmint Rhino," she said...but then explained that they only let her dance til 9pm, then made her leave til 3am, when she was allowed back in the club. During those intervening hours, she would sometimes go dance at a less discriminating club. Like the one in the holding tank at the CCDC!

Five stars for the lap dance, five stars for the company...but zero stars for everything else.

With any luck, I will NOT be returning to this establishment!

I waited in line here with my coworker for an hour, to be behind 3-4 parties ahead of us. During that one hour, only 1 party was seated. This line would not budge, so we left. :*(

But, that stirred up my curiosity and decided to come at an off-time (they're open 24 hours) after some Vegas debauchery. 

Ordered the combo (crab, lobster, shrimp) pan roast with level 7 spiciness (levels 1-10), which was a pretty mild spicy. 

I was intrigued by the old fashion boilers in front http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=i6GMotN-jpqlLc9gpmjgEw, as I saw the chef start off by cooking the fresh seafood medley in the boiler, then added the cajun seasoning, the broth, and finally kept adding the cream sauce base/roux. 

The pan roast had strong flavor, where I think adding extra rice or noodles ($1.99) is essential. I actually think this soup would make a really delicious pasta sauce. And then there were juicy and generous clumps of seafood, very yum. 

Service was attentive (you're sitting right in front of them) and the chef kept asking when would be the next time he'll be seeing me, and I assured him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday. (I wish)
I definitely will be back to try the infamous gumbo, clam chowder, and (new york) oysters/shooters.

My favorite hotel in Las Vegas hands down. The rooms are decor heaven with the best view on the strip. They also have balconies which is awesome and rare for strip hotels. 
The parking garage is also one of a kind. With each spot they have a pressurized sensor that either reads red for "spot taken" or green for "available spot" this makes parking less of a nightmare unlike a lot of garages.
 The Cosmo also has some of the best restaurants in Vegas. CHINA POBLANO by chef Jos Andrs created especially for Las Vegas showcases his personal take on Chinese and Mexican cuisines. Noodles and tacos come together in a festive, stylish setting. Ive tried the majority of items on the menu but my favorite are the chocolate tacos. amazing. STK is another one of my absolute faves. The bar is the centerpiece for this lively new aged steakhouse. This is a must visit place.
Marquee Day/Night Club- Vegas's newest hottest club on the strip. 3 stories of awesomeness and different themes for each, there is something for everyone here. The Library (3rd level) is my favorite. with the employees dressed up as librarians and the room rings true to an old fashioned library. 
The Boulevard Pool- Best place in Vegas for concerts. this venue is absolutely stunning with the palm trees and city center as the back ground. Its also pretty cool too because the crowd stands in the pool that s drained out for concerts, and the stage is up close and personal. very intimate setting.
Shopping- you cant forget the shops! DNA2050 is a one stop shop for the ultimate denim fit, style and trend. A boutique offering a unique and contemporary way to shop.
CRSVR Sneaker Boutique-Specializing in limited edition sneakers and men's & women's casually dressed up fashion.

All in all this is an amazing property and its def a must visit!!

At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. 

For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan. 

Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat. 

While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.

AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! These burgers are delicious! 

I absolutely love burgers! My wife heard about this place and decided to take me here. I love her! We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! We had a 25 minute wait but it went by quick. (thank God for Angry Birds!) So the hostess came and took us to our booth. FYI walk slowly or you will bust your ass. Their floor is extremely slippery. I don't know if there's grease on the floor or what. 

We looked over the menu and started off with the Berry Lemonade and the Bourbon BBQ Sriracha Wings. They were both delicious! Next we both had the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. It was huge and outstanding! The homemade potato chips are really good also. 

I also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps . 

Step 1. Pick your burger. 

You have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger. 

Step 2. Pick your bun. 

Next you pick your bun with Brioche, Wheat, Baguette, Focaccia, 
Topless or Full Monty Style as choices 

Step 3. Pick your rub. 

Choose from Angel Dust, Kona Crust, BBQ, Kingston Jerk, 
Cracked Peppercorn and Bayou Cajun 

Step 4. Pick your cheese for $1 more 

Choose from Cheddar, White American, Horseradish Cheddar, 
Sharp Provolone, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Smoked Gouda and Buffalo Cheddar. 

Step 5. Pick your sauce. 

Choose from Bourbon BBQ, Dijon Mayo, Banana Ketchup, House Sauce, Spicy Marinara, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sriracha Remoulade, Buttermilk Ranch, Spicy Ketchup, 
Whole Grain Mustard, Avocado Wasabi, Bleu Cheese Dressing, 
Buffalo Sauce, Relish and Chipotle Sour Cream 

Step 6. Pick a topping for $1 more. 

Choose from Fried Egg, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Chili, Caramelized Onion Marmalade, Grilled Pineapple, Sauted Mushrooms, Maple Cured Ham, Onion Straws, Roasted Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Brandied Peppercorn, Cabernet Sauce and Roasted Red Peppers. 

Step 7. Pick a free topping. 

Choose from Iceberg, Romaine, Field Greens, Baby Spinach, 
Arugula, Red Onion, Tomato, Poblano Peppers, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Bread & Butter Pickles and Jalapenos. Lots of choices and ways to customize your burger. 

Burgatory is my new favorite burger place!

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

Marquee is the newest club to hit Vegas and it is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. A gorgeous club full of gorgeous people! My girls and I agreed that it would be very, very hard for any other place to top it... it was that epic.

The main room will blow you away with its 40 foot LED DJ booth, but make sure you check out all three levels, including the Boombox and the Library - you will be wowed by it all. The Boombox is a smaller underground club with a separate DJ, and the Library is more of an intimate lounge area hidden behind the massive LED screen - complete with pool tables, vintage books and offers more craft cocktails. And if you need to cool off, head outside, where you'll be impressed by the incredible backdrop of City Center views and the fabulous pool cabanas with see-through jacuzzis. 

We received rockstar treatment from beginning to end, and were fortunate to be walked right in. The GA line was scary long. We ended up dancing the night away at the VIP booth right next to the DJ booth, so it almost seemed like we were go-go dancers on stage. It was ATB's first night of residency and it was so amazing to be right there with him. His set was totally nostalgic - remember "Till I Come"?! - we were partying like it was 1999! The dance floor was completely packed with a high energy crowd.

Marquee has really taken the Vegas club to a new level. AMAZE-BALLS!!

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Fresh-prepared food like a Pasta counter, Salad station, and custom Crepes 
 - Mounds of Crab Legs and Shrimp
 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

I have been coming to this location for a couple of months now. It's convenient when I am working in the area or meeting up with family at a nearby dog park. I love that there is a drive-thru. The inside appears clean and the staff is not only friendly, but they remember regulars and make time to say hello to my dog, Brownie when she happens to be in the passenger seat. Brownie also loves the free "Puppuccino" they give her! You can ask for one of those for your fur baby at any Starbucks. Inside as well the drive-thru can be long at times, but it moves along smoothly most of the time. My drinks have been made right and the bakery items I've tried have been fresh, quick and convenient on the days I only have a short break. This Starbucks is in a small trip mall and the parking can be tight as well pulling in/out of the lot can be a bit frustrating with the congestion of cars in it sometimes. 

If you aren't apart of the Starbucks rewards program yet you frequent Starbucks, it would be smart to sign up. I get a free coffee on my birthday along with freebies throughout the year based on my purchases and stars earned. After 12 stars you get any free food or beverage item! I go to Starbucks anyway so this is just a way to earn something back on something I'm going to purchase anyway. I also buy the coffee in the store and can enter star codes online from some of those products as well. They also e-mail you when they have a "star dash" promotion or any other promotion going on.

Why'd the chicken cross the road?
To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!

A late night dessert restaurant is something every area of town needs, and the southwest area is no exception.  So Serenade is definitely a welcome addition to this part of town! 

We arrive after 8 pm and most of the tables are occupied by those enjoying hot drinks, on their laptops, or enjoying a sweet treat.  We grab the one large table by the counter and it takes awhile for us to decide.  Ultimately, we get the Honey Bread ($8.50) (aka Honey Toast) with extra honey and two drinks - the Pistachio Latte ($4.50) and the Peppermint Latte ($4.50).  The flavor is quite subtle for the Pistachio Latte and the Husband enjoyed it.  The Little Guy preferred my Peppermint Latte more though.  The honey bread is lovely as usual, but they do offer a Garlic version for 50 cents more.  Apparently it's garlic butter instead of plain butter used on it. 

The menu has your standard cafe drinks, hot and cold.  Waffles, cakes, pizzas, and pastries are among the items to munch on.

They offer outside seating and blankets too!

Stamp cards are available via the Epoxy app, so download for your Buy 9 Get 1 Free cards.  

Since they are located in the Smiths's Shopping Center, and the same corner as Rice N Noodle and Patty's Closet, there is plenty of parking available.  Free WiFi - look for the pass code on the board behind the register.

Overall, a nice alternative to meet up with friends at for coffee and cake.

We get there. Reservations for six at 6. Half our party is there, half is on it's way. We tell them we're here. Can't sit until the whole parties there. I get that. But then the hostess adds "we have a party at 8 PM that's sitting at your table and you'll have to leave by then." I get that, sometimes you gotta hustle.

We sit at 6:15 with our whole party. Our server comes up without even a GREETING and says, "we have another party sitting here at 8 PM, so you'll have to be done by then." I don't get that....

That was just a little too much! I've never been anywhere that was so blatant about getting you outta there asap. I understand you've got to move people in and out, but don't tell us when we haven't even ordered a thing and are planning on spending money in your establishment! Even with taking our time we were done at 7:45 PM. Plenty of time to clean off the table for this important party. 

Too bad because the food was good. The service left a little to be desired...

A chip collector?   Are you a gambler?  A semi pro Vegas historian?

Then Spinettis is the shop for you.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WCyD3030jgcUJSpCJ-jgig&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

I have a friend who is an avid chip collector, he has cases of them, really cool display. He asked me to call him from Spinettis and let him talk to the guy there. Happy to help a friend in need.  I watched the guy started pulling a bunch of old $5 chips from the case and handed me back the phone. "Are there 17of them" my friend asked? I counted..1.2.3.4... Yup. " OK pay him $425 for the lot". WTF I thought for less than $100 wort of chips! My friend is a nut!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinettis-home-gaming-supplies-las-vegas-2#TeeFv031vYLnN7cmjtNqDA

But as I looked at the chips and the hundreds of others I could see the appeal. These were some pretty unique chips with some cool artwork. I liked an Elvis one the best.

The guy working the chips was very nice and must really know his stuff, I certainly got a education on the chip collection game. He told me there are people with thousands of them and some go for mega bucks (thousands!). Sorry I left camera in the store. Borrowed these.

They got other stuff for collectors from ash trays to dice to cards from various LV casinos. 

They also have anything you may need to transform your house into a mini casino. Tables, chips, cards, dice, shufflers even bingo supplies, so rush on over there and get yourself in on some of the lucrative casino bucks. Why should Italians and Indians have all the fun?

So if collecting stuff like this floats your boat give this place a try, I'm sure you can find something for your collection too.

Parents of children with disabilities, this is the museum for you. The staff here are very empathetic and understanding of their behaviors. For example, if you got an autistic kid who verbally stims, the staff won't tell him to be quiet. I'm giving LVNHM a 5-star review just based on how nice the staff is!!!

The admission fee is $10.00 for adults. I know that most yelpers dropped out of school, and $10 is a lot of money to you guys, but maybe cut back on the Yonaka and Snowflake for a couple of days and you can finally save enough money to come here. Hey, you might even lose some weight so you no longer have to take pictures of yourself at those odd angles where they can't see your body. I'm kidding..I'm kidding...Just busting your balls again. But, LVNHM does participate in a program that allows anyone with a BOA debit card in for free twice a month! So you can keep your Taiwanese shaved ice, bring it here to LVNHM, and eat it in front of the animatronic dinosaur. (note- btw I'm an Art of Flavors guy)

I brought the same kid from my review of "Tony's Container Park" here. He liked this place a lot better than Tony's park for 2 particular  reasons: 1st they didn't stigmatize him and accuse him of being one of the homeless children that live downtown. 2nd, there were no hipsters.

At 2pm we get to feed the sharks, and they even got those blind cavefish that can see things through their other senses. There is also a turtle, a big snake, and a scorpion.  And on the bottom floor they got Double Deck Blackjack, 15 slot machines, video poker and a full bar. Yes, bring all your nerdy Asian yelp friends over here, since you guys never understand sarcasm for some reason...

Since Christmas is coming up they decorated this place really  nice. They also put up a bunch of Hanukkah decorations. This is probably the best time to come. 

On weekends they close real early, so please after your next UYE at Poppy Den, skip Johnny Fontanes for one night and don't stay out till 5 am drinking. But, if you do spend all night drinking, remember to drive really fast because it decreases the amount of time you spend on the road, which equals more sleep! I'm a well educated gentleman so take my advice as fact.

I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

In summary, an absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!

Eff you McDonalds, eff you! 

You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. 

As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. 

After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. 

McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....

We came here recently, when a friend bought us a couples massage.  Our most recent visit brought back all my memories of this great Hyatt locale, just minutes from our front door. 

As I've previously noted, with some minor updating: "The rooms here are amazing, as are the guest services. Looking for Spa Day? Well this Hyatt is the place!  Looking for a beautiful sunset dinner by a fire pit?  No question, then you have to come here.  

If you are lucky to be a Diamond Club member, their Regency Club is one of the best in the world.  I would rank this Hyatt alongside Brenner's Park in Baden Baden; the Savoy or Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London for WOW factor. Simply outstanding!  Stay and enjoy the sunsets and Gondola ride after dinner!"

Our couples massage began with a relaxed, tranquil time outside in their shaded portico (photo), sipping cucumber and fruited mineral water, overlooking the Spa's private pool. 

After a few minutes, we were escorted to our room by two massage therapists to select our scented oils. The hour slipped by ever so slowly and was over before we realized it. Wow, they were very professional and made us feel renewed

But that wasn't the end of our visit. Again we returned to the portico and some quiet time by the pool. One of our friends who was also here for a Spa Day soon joined us. We enjoyed some delicious flavored teas for the rest of the afternoon and some good conversation. The shopping in the Hyatt, though small is excellent. 

As noted before, "...we have stayed at this Hyatt Regency many times when we lived elsewhere.  But now that we live in the valley, it has become a fun place to go for dinning (See: Alto Ristorante e Bar and SWB Southwest Bistro)."  

Come, eat, relax, stay, visit; you'll be glad you did!  Five Stars, simply the best!

Enjoy!!

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

This is more of a rebuttal and a little update to Bautista's K (the owner?) review since I was mentioned in it.
 
----"As for Shirley B. - was very surprised to find this review redundant. As if it was to sabotage a business and give a review only on the 3rd day of "soft opening" -"----

Am I understanding this right? I am being accused of sabotage? I sure hope not.
 I cant take this unwarranted accusation lightly and feel the need to address it.
 
I normally do write ups after a first visit to new places but my review was based after a second visit (2/10) to this place a week and a half later, not on the 3rd day of soft opening (Jan 30) that Bautista K comprehended. .  Go over and reread my review again, 4th paragraph where I mention my 2nd visit.
  
As for redundancy, I cant help that since both visits when I ate there, temperature wise, the food was not hot enough. Which by the way is fact since it was reflected in SNHD inspection a day later coincidentally after my review was written. Update:  I'm happy Bautista's  took proactive steps and corrected it and now rockin the A grade.

For the most part my review was positive as I mention food tasted good, prices reasonable and friendly staff. Some people think I'm way too nice and too generous with the ratings I dish out. Sorry you take the overall review as sabotaging your business but I still stand by my original review.
 
I sure hope the accusation is just a misunderstanding. All who know me know I am a big advocate and supporter for businesses in our community and only want to see everyone succeed.  Even your business here in Vegas Bautista K!  Happy to hear you are doing great with all the new dishes I see you are now offering  and possibly look forward to trying them one of these days.

I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood dcor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.

The Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. 

The server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.

I then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, "We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink." Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.

The owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, "I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro."

I have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.

I would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same.

We were downtown chic last week and attended a Mercury game (VIP I might add...for whatever that's worth!) and dined afterward at Hanny's. WOW! Walking in I felt the heaven's had opened and the choir was a-singin'! This space should be my home. Beautiful, modern decor with the right lighting casting a soothing blanket of warmth. Nice. Greeted immediately we sat at a high top table near the window. I was so consumed with the fabulous company I was with I hadn't realized something. We. Were. The. Only. Diners. A few bar flies scattered around the bar in the middle of the room. 9:15 on a Thursday. My heart sank. Or was I actually slipping off the bar stool from those two $9 beers from the Mercury game? 

The good:
Well, service was swift and friendly. Though he seemed a tad nervous. Perhaps because we smelled of lesbians. Not sure. 

Ambience. Duh! Covered that. Including the restrooms and the glassed in elevator shaft. I still get dizzy just thinking of that!

PIZZA. Yep. I never would order pizza in a non pizza place. Rickie did. Rickie won. Rickie ate. Carne pizza. Order it!

The bad:
TINY martinis. Who makes these? Barbie? Tattoo from Fantasy Island? The Lucky Charm leprachaun?

Empty room. Bummer. I like a good, energetic, lively vibe. But we did entertain ourselves with lively banter about nothing important and most certainly became shallow and caddy. Realllllly, makes you want to hang out with me, eh?

The ugly:
My sandwich. The prime rib, with thick slabs o bacon, fried egg on ciabatta. Steak Umms. Was all I could compare it to. So disappointed. One thin, thin, thin, strip of, er, um, prime rib *cough* *cough* Steak Umms. Dry. Bland. Overcooked. Like my Aunt Helen after too much Chardonnay at a backyard BBQ. Onion strings, however, FANTASTIC.

My other diner/Mercury fans were OK with their sandwiches; I remember one had pork the other hard boiled eggs. Not sure exactly. Sorry. Those $9 beers really did a number on me. 

The good Part 2 Electric Boogaloo:
Onion strings! Had to repeat. 

I WILL GO BACK TO YOU HANNY'S. It was sort of like an awkward first date. Started off dicey. In the middle we had some laughs and wiped mayo from our lips. But did we kiss at the end of the night? Hmmm...not so sure. 

Let's see what happens on that second date.

A tour de force of Spanish cuisine.  

A meal at E is a dining experience capturing the excitement and joy of discovery through food and conversation.  This exclusive restaurant within a restaurant is a tapas bar on steroids.  Modernist cuisine at its finest as molecular gastronomy collides with traditional techniques.  This is one of the greatest foodie adventures bar none.

There is no menu.  The offerings change with the seasons.  Unfortunately, the incredible salt crusted foie from the fall of 2011 is not a part of the current winter 2012 offering.  All good.  

The ingredients are incredible.  From selections of sublime, umame packed cured ham to the sweet earthiness of roasted Iberico pork to the salty brininess of quality caviar everything works to create flavor explosions.

Sure, every course may not be to your liking but with the huge number of courses, you are sure to find something you can't live without.  The progression of dishes is very bold.  Courses compete with one another, with each making a bolder statement than the last.  Utterly incredible.  

Desert lovers rejoice, the meal ends with multiple deserts.  The only way to describe them is WOW!

Opt for the wine pairing.  The selections tie the meal together perfectly.  

The entire evening is engaging.  You watch the chefs prepare and plate the majority of dishes right in front of you.  Conversation between the chefs and your fellow guest is encouraged.  It is an extremely social meal.  Just wait until you start sharing wine from the porron.  Unintentionally missing your mouth and pouring wine on your face and down your neck is a real ice breaker.

There is only one way to make a reservation at E, through email.  Don't bother calling the Cosmo.  They can't help you.  Send an email request to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with the number of your party (not to exceed eight), and a range of dates and times.  A restaurant manager will respond and ask about any food allergies and dietary restrictions.  If your restrictions can be met and if there are openings, your invitation will be confirmed.  You will receive your golden tickets via SNAIL MAIL.  Bring them with you.

Probably the best $250 you will spend at a top restaurant anywhere.

An open mind and open heart?  You will have the time of your life.  Highly recommended!

All is not well in the Emerald City of Las Vegas. It seems that the nickel and dime mentality has settled in here leaving guests wondering what other unforeseen charges or overlooked amenities will be discovered.  I DO NOT recommend staying here. My friend and I have had too many unpleasant surprises in just two days. It is a shame really that a  prominent hotel like this has sunk to cheapness and frankly, some dishonesty thrown in. We are here attending a convention and the convention center itself has been wonderful. It is sparkling clean, with great meeting rooms and halls. Our time at the convention is enjoyable without a doubt. But then.....

Something is incredibly amiss at the hotel. The MGM is undergoing construction and that is part of the problem This is a BIG reason to avoid this place for now. Their website attempts to gloss over this fact. It says that the MGM is getting a "grand renovation" and then proceeds to tell you to check out what is new. Oh how exciting!  However, it isn't the kind of excitement you want; a letter placed on your bed, informing you to expect construction noise as well as the water supply being shut off on certain days. Why are guests paying $200 a night and being checked onto a floor where the water is being shut off? This is truly a first for me. For this incredible inconvenience (which you pay for) you receive a letter thanking you in advance for understanding the difficulties of renovating this hotel. They offer you a 15% discount on a future stay....WHAT!  After checking in and being encouraged to spend an additional $15 per day to experience the "grand renovation' experience, you get your water shut off and construction noise during the day! When I called guest services to ask for my 15% discount today, I was lectured on how unemployment is a problem and I should be glad that the hotel did not close to renovate. Can it get any more bizarre? Is there a Wizard behind a curtain spinning politically correct excuses in this Emerald City? Is this mega-million dollar corporation so greedy that it cannot absorb a few empty rooms?   How about closing one wing? How about honestly updating future guests on your website like other hotels do that there is construction going on and it may be noisy, and for this inconvenience we are offering a sale?  Is it because there is deeply planted nickel and dime antics going on? The strict mini fridge "touch it and you own it" rule, charging $50 per day if any personal items are found in this fridge(I guess rental fee added to $200?) , $10 fee for $80 ATM withdrawal, lack of in-room coffee maker, and mandatory resort fee of $25 per day, even though the "resort" pools and grounds are closed for the season, are all signs of a grand hotel where the customer comes last. Any good things about my stay? The hotel is clean and the staff is exceptionally pleasant, but one can hardly notice these things when one is staying in a hell of a renovation resort. We have 4 more days here. We will update you on whether the MGM Grand is Grand enough to discount our stay for this inconvenience of renovation,  or instead,  will be passing out complimentary construction hats.  Stay tuned, and stay away!

Can you say "food coma?"

OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!

We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!

We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the "Nay Nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...

So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  

I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!

Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.

I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  

I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.

Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   

Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.

Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.

Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).

Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.

Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).

Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.

Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.

The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas may not be a 5-star hotel or casino, but it is a convenient, chic, contemporary, lovely, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip place to celebrate and have fun in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.

I'm so glad I finally gave Rollin Smoke a try and that I didn't go here by myself as I would've driven away. The location isn't that great. It's close to a strip club, adult stores, etc. Tits and BBQ - this is a man's restaurant. The BBQ aroma fills the air inside the restaurant and sticks to your hair and clothes (had to shampoo my hair twice).

The food was amazing!  I'm not the biggest fan of ribs so, for me to like this place is a major deal. We had a meat Trio: brisket, pork and ribs with waffle fries and Mac n cheese. I liked everything we got. The meats were tender, juicy and smokey. I poured some house BBQ sauce on the meats for more flavor. The waffle fries were very crispy and I wanted to order more. The Mac n cheese has a smokey taste to it as well but was runny...still damn good though. The chicken sandwich and a black berry cobbler were ok.

This is not a fast-food restaurant so, expect to wait about 20 minutes or more to get your food. It's worth the wait.

Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!

My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.

You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.  

There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.  

There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort.

As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.

By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. 

I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.

They listened.
They created.
They named. (after me!!!)

We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!

So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.

I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

About a year and a half ago Yelp hosted a Non-Profit "Yelp Helps" evening downtown in Phoenix.  It was an incredible event that in some ways changed my family's life.  

You see, after putting on my name tag and riding the elevator up to the event, I was greeted by our Yelp Community Manager Lindsey, who in short order handed me the cutest Chihuahua named Christian.

Christian was so small and clearly very frightened by all the noise.  I walked around the various organization booths, stopping at the Lost Our Home area while hold Christian.  At some point Lindsey asked for him back; and sadly, I said my goodbyes to the little guy.  

The next day, I found myself searching on-line for the Lost Our Home website.  Looking over their requirements and of course, the pups.  Don't get me wrong, I call all dogs pups.  And guess what?  I found a cute little Morkie  named "Chloe" on their Adoptions page.  See photos.

A Morkie, I learned, is a Maltese and Yorkie mix.  I made a few phone calls and arranged for one of the Volunteers to stop by my home with Chloe to see if she would feel comfortable with our other dog, Oliver and our two cats.

That Sunday, Chloe arrived and she seemed to fit in really well. After the volunteer left we had our family discussion and it was a go!  Later that week we adopted Chloe and she was dropped off at my office soon after.

What you need to know, is how straight forward and easy a process adopting a "foreclosure" animal is from Lost Our Home.  They have many Veterinarian who offer their services on a per diem/pay as you can basis.  It will change your life.  trust me!

BTW, they are looking for Volunteers.  Hint. Hint.

I had seen this food truck at many a Saturday morning market here downtown, but I never paid them much attention.  Then one day I did because I was really hungry and in a rush.  The result was awesomeness!

But the large posted menu is kind of deceiving.  It presents their 4 standard dogs but doesn't fully speak to the uniqueness and deliciousness of their food, nor does it really give you all your options, which are plentiful.  These are some of the things you should know, that you probably won't realize from their menu:

They come on naan fry bread, not buns.
(Though you can request buns, but that would be silly.)
This does not come across on their board anywhere, but it is the foundational magic of their product.

They let you choose your own wiener.
[insert bad joke here]
They have traditional, veggie, bratwurst, and my favorite: beer-hot.  The beer-hot with the naan is the best combo ever!

They have about two-dozen toppings.
You get a hint of this in the descriptions of their standard-four, but it helps a LOT to see the toppings listed out (plus they have some that don't show up on the standard-four).  They have the list up on a small laminate menu by the window.

Their ingredients are mostly local, and some are organic.

I've gotten a beer-hot w/ fresh jalapeos, swiss, cilantro, and red onions; and also a bratwurst w/ sauted onions, sauerkraut, and spicy mustard.

Bottom line is this truck needs more accessible marketing, because they have a GREAT product!

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

"Eat rice, drink tea, slurp noodles, stay healthy".  Maybe.

Accept this about all Asian restaurants on the Strip:
1)  Prices are 2x-3x higher than your local joint.
2)  Portions are smaller but prettier.
3)  Flavors are not authentic.
4)  Specialty drinks are delicious.
5)  Service is excellent.

Straight to it, the food.  It's properly cooked by Western standards.  Veg in stir fries are still crisp and vibrant, deep fried chicken still moist, and scallops tender not rubber balls.  Seasonings and flavors are loosely Asian but are subdued and for the uninitiated.  Don't expect undertones of sweet, fermented fish sauce or umame charged fermented black beans.  The subdued flavors do work better with their creative mixed drinks.

Skip the everyday items or risk leaving upset at the price (miso soup at $9, beef broccoli at $25).  Opt for the extravagant.  The lobster tail in ginger onion soy glaze is good.  Correctly cooked.  The simple earthy soy does enhance the sweetness of the lobster and the ginger adds zest.  The togarashi rubbed seared ahi with a miso lime sauce is very good.

The only serious fault remains the sushi.  Questionable freshness.  The Uni, off color and fishy.  The sweet shrimp, slightly ammoniated and tacky mouth feel.  Creative rolls still miss the mark.  Over sauced, unbalanced flavors, bizarre cooking techniques.  Is the chef so vain he can't try one of the many AYCE joints and see how Vegas style sushi is done?  Face it, asking a Chinese chef to prepare Japanese sushi is the same as asking a Italian pizza cook to make dim sum.

To the credit of management, service problems have been correct.  Everyone is familiar with the menu and can describe dishes.  Bar staff who float ask regular staff before making recommendations.

Standard Asian beers.  Fairly priced introductory sakes.  

Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked "Asian" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.

Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called "best ramen" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA! 

We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.

I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me. 

For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a "knock-off" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely true.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being true to protocol. 

Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving "curly" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso. 

The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult. 

People in Los Angeles think they know what good or "authentic" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change. We got lucky this time... and yeah, f*ck you Los Angeles!

If you are looking for an Hollywood vibe this the place to be. The Chandelier is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino.  If you looking for an upscale place in Las Vegas you just found it. The place is worth visiting. 


This bar is just like the rest of the Cosmopolitan, very blingy, I don't usually like that sort of thing but I must admit the chandelier bar was pretty unique. They have got the ambience and lighting just right here, great atmosphere, lots of little nooks and crannies with tables in over 3 different levels.

We went here on 2 different nights for a drink, good quality cocktails, a couple of different ones I haven't seen before, if you want an old classic that isn't on the menu they will do it for you too. Even though it was quite busy we still managed to get seats every night, service was a little slow at times.

Is Harrah's the nicest hotel on the strip? Goodness no.

Is it the worst? No, not by a long shot. 

Is it cheap? In comparison to a lot of the other hotels, yes. 

Is Harrah's in a good location? Yes. Hell yes! It's located directly across the street from The Forum Shops, which is where Max Brenner's is located. For that reason alone I'd stay at Harrah's again.

At the end of the day, at least for me, the location of the hotel I'm staying at is what really matters to me. When I go to LV I spend almost all of my time outside of my room. In fact, all I use my room for is to shower and sleep. Because of this I don't need to stay anywhere fancy.

Now don't get me wrong, if I was a baller I'd be staying at The Cosmo or Wynn, but I'm not. On our most recent trip to Vegas, we were in town for four days (Thur-Sun), during the middle of Spring break. For four days during that busy season most of the nicer hotels (Cosmo, Wynn) wanted to charge me a grand or more for those days. No thank you.

Our mini suite (we got upgraded for free) featured a super comfy kind sized bed, a little balcony with a view of the pool, a mini fridge and a big bathroom that had a TV in it. Harrah's also had a really nice gym, which I used twice. We also got to check in at 11:45am instead of 3pm, which was cool. 

So yes, I am a fan of Harrah's. The rooms were nice, the service was great, the hotel is relatively cheap and it's located right in the middle of the Strip. 
Can't beat that.

Made a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.

The lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).

The Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.

Anyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.

Will I return?  No!

i have two words for you: herb baguette. I'm not a bread lover but this baguette doesn't need anything to taste good. Forget butter and don't bother dipping in olive oil. How is it possible that bread be so moist, dense, airy and flavorful all at the same time? I have no freakin' idea and that's why I have to buy from Gluten Free Creations, because there's no way I could replicate that. 

Okay okay I have no qualms with gluten. I don't really care what it is because it doesn't seem to affect me negatively, but why should only the celiac kids get the good stuff? And yes, I have tried to find this place twice before and failed (are gluten eaters stupid-er? possibly) but third times a charm when I stopped in this week. I'll admit it, I was looking for a cupcake. I think we all know about my cupcake addiction. GFC sells cupcakes in a 4-pack, which I can't support because that means I have to eat 4 cupcakes and I'm already killing myself at the gym for my one-at-a-time habit. But seriously, they had gluten free banana cupcakes! I was so sad they didn't have a spare to sell me...so sad I bought the mini herb baguettes and a brownie. 

The brownie was a two-person affair, a big frozen delight filled with thick chunks of chocolate. I couldn't tell the difference between it and a gluten-full brownie and that made me very happy. I think it may be time to start the "what makes a good brownie" debate; I feel like it will be a volatile one. I like them chewy with chunky bits. But the fluffy ones are nice too. 

 Truly though, the hero of the day was the herb baguette, which is a little smaller than a 6-inch sub, takes a long time to toast, but is worth the wait. I topped one of mine with farmer's cheese, roasted garlic and roasted red peppers. And I sat at the table crying because I knew each bite I took meant there was one less to take in the future. 

I love you Gluten Free Creations. I'm feeling smarter already.

This cake kicks other cake's @$$es, now queue the Rocky Theme Song!

Day after day, driving from bakery to bakery, looking for the perfect cake to present at the wife and my 30th birthday extravaganza. It was tedious work, but somebody had to do it. I felt a bit like Rocky Balboa, climbing up and down the endless flight of stairs and beating up on that hanging slab of meat. Except my stairs and cow was a fork and cake; plate to mouth lift, plate to mouth lift. You can work up a sweat just thinking about it.

It's wasn't easy choosing a bakery for that top notch cake. Chocolate cake, vanilla cake, marbled, and layered, filled with strawberry jam, raspberry ganache, topped with butter cream, cream cheese icing, fondant, rum infused; it's enough to make your head spin. I had to sacrifice and dedicate the countless hours of time to complete this task; but in the end, I got it done.

Good, bad, and indifferent, we made it through the first 5 or 6 opponents and ultimately found ourselves pitted against Kick Ass Kakes. Jay started throwing punches, left hook, right hook, upper cut, KO; I didn't think Rocky was ever KO'd in the movies, but maybe it was just a sugar coma - I'll go with that.

Jay got behind our crazy idea for a Hot Dog shaped cake; we 'were' catering Short Leash Hot Dogs after all and wanted a fun cake to go along!  Most other bakers we met with explained 'how difficult of a job it would be', how it would be 'better as a regular cake with hot dogs designed onto it', or lets 'craft little hot dogs and place them around the cake' instead. Jay was the only baker we met with who had the confidence to actually pull off what we were looking to do, and he did not disappoint!

You can check out the picture of our cake if you're interested; *view at your own risk* you might just get K.O.'d from looking at it. Ours is the cake that looks like a big hot dog! ;-)

Jay battered us silly with an awesome red velvet cake, filled with a perfect cream cheese icing, topped with fondant, and shaped to look like a Short Leash Hot Dog. It was a hit, everyone was knocked out with amazement at how cool the cake looked. This was the perfect center piece to our catered celebration!

Thanks again K.A.K's! You can bet we'll be around again for some of those cupcakes and macaroons you bake up daily, just let us recuperate a little before our next prized fight.

You never know what you're going to walk into when heading to a Native American casino for the first time.  I've learned through the years not to get my hopes up and expect too much. Boy, did Talking Stick prove me wrong.  

The casino is absolutely beautiful.  Everything is new, clean, and everyone on the staff from dealers to floor personnel are as friendly as can be.  It's not a big place, but they offer all of the games you would want (other than craps).  We were there on a Friday afternoon, and they were also offering table minimums in every price range.  There was a large selection of $5 tables for multiple games.  

We weren't there long enough to play poker, but we still took a look at the poker room to see what they offered.  What we saw was a poker room that put 90% of the rooms in Vegas to shame.  The room itself was a massive, with 50 tables spreading all of the games (Hold' Em, Stud and Stud/8, Omaha/8 and Omaha Hi).  Not many places spread Omaha Hi anymore, so that was a pleasant surprise.  And the room itself was just immaculate.  Wall-to-wall TVs to keep your attention between hands, and tableside food service that looked wonderful.

If you're in the area looking to get your casino fix in, this is definitely worth the trip.

I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S, and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek, horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio, sushi bar, bar area, and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.

We ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip. 

The Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll, and nigiri that included unagi, ika, sake, tai, maguro, white fish, and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots, and I thought the red snapper had already turned. 

I was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently, the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.

Service was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again.

Pros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no "green" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

Let me preface this with the crucial fact that I have not yet been to Hakkasan. But let me follow with two words that explain this 1 star rating: customer service. 

Everyone working in this industry should know and value the importance of customer service, especially in Las Vegas. People travel from all parts of the world to enjoy an extravagant weekend in the one&only Sin City. So to be mistreated, disrespected, and borderline harassed before even starting a vacation is unacceptable. 

Let me explain. 

I go to Vegas a lot. And I know a wonderful promoter who always hooks it up. She doesn't work for Hakkasan, so we went through a different promoter that my friend got the number for. Dan. He told us that our guys would have to pay - and that's fine. We understood, but didn't want to go to Hakkasan and pay over going to XS for free. 

The text my friend sent was incredibly polite: 

"hi sorry I think we're gonna pass cause we can get the guys into the other clubs for free. thanks anyway tho! I'll text you in the future :)"

Among other things, he responded with this:

"Ur gonna favor free & have an experience prob bad because we dominate sundays vs. having time of your life which is ur coming to Vegas." 

"whoever u talking to is miss leading you" because XS charging is "commonly known"

and repeatedly said that Hakkasan was the #1 club in the country. 

1) No need to put down other clubs or the fact that our guys don't want to pay
2) Don't tell us we won't have fun unless we come to your club
3) It's not all about being voted number 1 by a magazine, it's about customer service and relations and in the few months that Hakkasan has been open, they can't even beat a subpar tier 3 Vegas club on Yelp - that's probably due to poor customer service.

If this club expects to compete with XS, Marquee, & Surrender once the hype has died down, they should reevaluate how they treat potential guests at their club. 

I still plan on going to Hakkasan and I do look forward to seeing what all the hype is about. I believe that the owner of the club and those working have put a lot of hard work into making a new and exciting atmosphere for EDM lovers. But until I see for myself, my only impression of the club is through our interactions with the club's promoter - whose role is to represent and "promote" the club. Instead, his aggressive assertion of Hakkasan's superiority to all other clubs in Vegas and condescending response at our polite refusal of his offer left a bad taste in my mouth.

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). 

Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:

Rooms
 * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian
 * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft
 * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more
 * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View
 * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury
 * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)
 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

Dining
 * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting
 * Recommend CUT, Bouchon, Delmonico, AquaKnox, or SUSHISAMBA
 * Over 20 casual eateries will fit more budgets

 * Human Nature has Australians singing Motown ($74-$118)
 * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations
 * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas
 * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation
 * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out

Shopping
 * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal
 * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat)
 * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end
 * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights
 * Some will like Jimmy Choo, Coach, DvF, or Michael Kors
 * It'Sugar is always sweet
 * Many of the restaurants are located along the Grand Canal

Parking & Location
 * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo
 * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island
 * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage
 * Follow signs from main Venetian entrance
 * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking

The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

**breakfast review**

I had absolutely no expectations at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grll, I don't follow his TV persona or his shows. All I know is that he grills and invades peoples' restaurants for a challenge, how freakin' humble..
But I could honestly say this is one of the best breakfast (or actually brunch) places I've had in a very long time!

I started off my brunch with a Spicy Bloody Mary, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=g_DhgA5vwnDyojJ5hAg00Q
Honestly not worth the $9, but I appreciated the unique olive & chile pepper on the side, and the drink didn't taste like straight up tomato juice + vodka, there were a lot of spices in there! 
Warning, it was quite spicy for a morning drink. I thought "Hey~~~ Whatever, I'm in Vegas,"  but boy, did it kick my @ss that morning. 

Their impressive "bread basket" is breakfast alone! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Sy-fdjtW7Drd-6LBJ-i3ww

You must get the one and only soup Mesa Grill serves, the Grilled Corn Soup. Delicious and the consistency reminded me of soupier porridge, which made me feel warm and homey :*) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=0UI-AK7kH_DvUWgjOce34g

I admit I was regretful while ordering a salmon dish while Mesa is known for Tex Mex, but my Honey Glazed Salmon w/ black bean sauce was amazing. You can request the salmon medium or even medium rare!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Wz2EFRR4Kt-uZfR6WPjoPg

My girlfriends also ordered other breakfast staples like a Sweet Potato Hash (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=u4pq7PFOPYytWEhfxCxQ0w) and the Jalapeno scrambled eggs with Ham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=8YIzCO87s62KyKgqNedm5g). I can easily say these dishes were impressively satisfying breakfast dishes, and definitely exceeded my expectations.

BREAKFAST FOOD SUCCESS!

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

We had a great time yesterday on a rainy (yes rainy) Sunday morning.

We arrived around ten-thirty and the place was packed. There must have been two dozen ahead of us waiting in line.  So, after a few minutes we decide to sit at the counter, since it was mostly empty.

Our waitress was Briann, who set us up with some coffee almost as we sat down.  Great start!  We ordered the waffles with thick-cut pepper bacon with a couple of spicy sausage patties and some eggs, hashbrowns and bacon.

Everything was very good and as we came to the end of our meal, we noticed the Hostess and told her to take our name off the list for a table.  LOL!  Turns out the list was for the counter as well. D'oh!  Then why were all the seats empty?

Anyway, the rains let up and we were off to the Phoenix Art Museum.  Great way to start a Sunday morning. Our total was a fair $26.50 including taxes, but before gratuities.

Enjoy!

We came here for a business lunch and left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. 

As our server Carlos bought us our menu and water glasses, I had already figured out what I was going to order.  I had been reading the Yelp reviews about their delicious Ceviche for $14.00. What caught my eye was the small cuts, almost diced portions of fish.  In some restaurants, it is almost like they are trying to overwhelm you with the size of the cuts.  Not here!  And yes, it was delicious!  Carlos asked how much spice I wanted before he mixed all the ingredients.  First class.

Also while we were checking in on Yelp, we found that there was $5.00 Off one Don Julio Blanco margarita. Thank you Yelp! They were also willing to substitute the offer for their Sangria. Nice!

My friend Richard S had the equally good breaded Coconut Calamari for $12.50. It was excellent!  

We split our bill and our lunch came to very reasonable $19.63, including taxes and tip. Next up will be coming here for their Happy Hour and Taco Tuesdays.

Buffets should end with you smiling and patting your belly, after having unbuttoned your pants to fit in one last round. When u find yourself at your table sharing the same look with your friends: that blank stare out to nowhere, playing with your food and wondering why you didn't spend that 25 bucks on the Monopoly or Sex and the City slot machine or all red, you know u ain't happy. 
What sucks is that, we came here as our last hurrah lunch before heading home, having eaten many delicious meals- we were pretty disappointed.
I should have listened to my gut feeling after seeing rates of this place dropping in their latest yelp reviews.  It wasn't unsavory looking as the lower end "buffet of buffets" buffets, but it certainly made me wonder what i would be getting if i spent that 40 bucks for dinner on a peak day. Would it be that much better? Or more of the same stuff... A whole station devoted to tortilla chips with only red and green salsa was a bit of a turnoff. 
The dishes i did enjoy were some pork slider thing, leek dumpling, bacon, and hashbrown ball. They had a small selection of Thai and indian food which you dont' find everywhere- but they were ordinary.  What we found ourselves doing, was mixing up some of the dry dishes with the saucy items to make things more interesting... eating our cookies with the icecream or frosting off the cupcakes. The mini cupcakes were cute http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=uJVqblRmMmvsl3P6pkU_KA, frosting was ok, but i am not a huge fan of glitter on my cupcakes. but since we were in vegas, where glitter is a common accessory- i ate it anyways. Frosting was not bad!
Atleast it was very pretty in the atrium where we were seated!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=VIoLtKLPGWmd-H5HZBNDRQ

Wicked spoon is still better and i need to go back to M Buffet, which i remember was pretty good a couple of years ago.

Eating at a buffet is all about choices and 500+ items automatically makes it 5 stars and the greatest daily buffet in Vegas history.  If you can't find at least 25 things you enjoy here, you might want to consider seeking professional help.  

They really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza, sushi, and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas, lamb chops, ribeye, ramen, kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  

Avoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  

Bravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!

I was driving through Mt. Lebanon at lunchtime and saw a new sign on Washington Rd. I'm glad I stopped to investigate because I was in for a delicious surprise! 

The Simple Greek is essentially a Greek food version of Chipotle and Qdoba (with all the same greatness!) You can build a pita, a salad, or a bowl with rice, vegetables, sauces, and meats to your own liking. I had a gyro meat rice bowl with delicious sour cream tzatziki sauce, green beans and potatoes in red sauce, and fresh veggies on top. I was so excited that I could decide what flavors to put together! They really make it to suit you--when I asked to try both types of rice in my bowl, the man making my meal was perfectly willing to split it down the middle to make it just the way I wanted it.

Additionally, the staff there was wonderful! I really appreciated that they took the time to explain what was in everything because, as someone with multiple food allergies, I hate to be surprised. Also, the woman in line behind me was asking about the vegetarian options on the menu and the man assisting her seemed very accommodating to her too. Each person I talked to seemed genuinely happy that I was there to eat, and that is always a plus in my book!

The atmosphere is welcoming, the place looks clean and well-maintained, and I'm eager to recommend it to all of my friends!

If you're in Las Vegas and you're as awesome as I am, please spend an evening at Insert Coins. It sure beats a night out at one of those swanky Las Vegas clubs. 

Let's compare and contrast the two potential experiences.

The Cover at a Swanky Vegas Club: It tends to be free if you're a girl and $20 (or more) if you're a guy. Lame. Those clubs should be paying me for my presence.

The Cover at Insert Coins: It was free for girls and $5 for guys. Sort of lame, but it could be worse. 

The Winner: Insert Coins. It's the lesser of the two evils, which is why I voted for Barack Obama in 2008.

The People at a Swanky Vegas Club: The guys usually have enough gel in their hair to glue together two bowling balls. And they tend to wear tight t-shirts with metallic prints or a dress shirts with really big stripes and maybe a skull on the back. Either fashion choice shows off their steroid influence muscles and fake tans. And yeah, they will say they are 30 and look more like 44.

As for the women, you will usually see them caked with make up, Medusa like hair extensions, one size too tight dresses from Forever 21, and heels they got on sale at Macy's, but are one half size too big. They look sloppy. So they walk around in big groups so they seem more attractive. It's the Sorority Effect. Sure, they look great in a large group. But individually, no one really stands out.

The People at Insert Coints: The guys were in jeans and t-shirts. The girls were in jeans and t-shirts.  I actually felt totally comfortable wearing a Pac-Man t-shirt, jeans, and some Star Wars shoes. And I even got compliments from men and women on my attire. It's just that kind of joint.

Winner: Insert Coins. I'll take a laid back setting over a the Jersey Shore. 

The Entertainment at a Swanky Vegas Club: Some random DJ who is famous for playing music off his MacBook that usually consists of electronic dance music that hasn't changed much since 1995. Sigh.

The Entertainment at Insert Coins: If you're an old school gamer, hit up the old school arcades from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I showed off my Pac-Man skills, then played some WWF wrestling game where half of the characters were currently dead, and then moved on to some Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat.

You can also play more current video games at the bar such as Madden, FIFA Soccer, and Tekken. And they have lounge sections with an array of choices to sit back, grab some drinks, and play video games with your friends.

In the background, there was some pretty awesome late 80s and early 90s New Jack Swing type music. So people could get up and dance the night away to New Edition and their spin off acts such as Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Bell Biv Devoe. Best advice ever: Never trust a big butt and a smile.

Winner: Insert Coins. Duh.

Anyway, if you're in Las Vegas and want a break from the strip, head to Insert Coins. It's the perfect place to sit back, grab a drink, and be awesome.

It has been a really LONG time since i've been really wowed by sushi. I came to a point in my life where I really questioned whether or not sushi, in general, has become perpetually trite. After visiting Daisho, my opinion of sushi has changed. This is now my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, and what they are doing here is surprisingly wonderful. Here's why:

First, after walking in the door and being seated by the server at the bar, we were given our menu's. They had the expected items you would see on any sushi menu, but after looking at the appetizer menu, you can tell that these guys are trying to do things distinctive. We had the AYCE menu for 25 bucks, and Tony T. and I started our voyage through this unique menu.

Note: We tried a great volume of items, so I would probably max out the 5000 character limit on Yelp reviews by describing only 1/4 of what we had. There was zilch that I didn't like on menu, but there some dishes that are especially noteworthy.

: Salmon Collar/Yellowtail Collar - This was unbelievable. I was totally blown away, especially by the salmon. The first time I had collar of a fish was at Yonaka, and it was wonderful. On the other hand, the collar at Daisho completely blows Yonaka's out of the water!!! Wonderfully tender, with the natural fat sustaining the moistness of the fish, personally (especially with the salmon), I thought I was eating foie gras. It was prepared with an expert hand, and cooked with precision.  It absolutely melted in the mouth. I'm still thinking about it.

: Uni and Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - Freshest and highest quality uni and salmon roe i've ever had, EVER. The uni had a delicate, but firm texture, and had a clean taste. The same goes for Ikura as well. 

I FINALLY found a place that makes sushi rice correctly!!!! A great deal of people think that it's effortless to create great sushi rice. What folks don't realize is, that in world-class sushi restaurants, sushi apprentices and beginner trainees spend 3-4  (or more) YEARS learning just how to make rice, before they are given the permission to touch a piece of fish. Making sushi rice in itself, is an art form. And these guys nailed it.

A small footnote: This locale is great for low-carbers. There are more than 5 rice less rolls and plenty of apps that do not contain starch or rice, including collar, poke, oysters, yaki-tori and more!!

Hate to say it, but Free Vegas Club Passes didn't exactly deliver as I had hoped during my girls weekend in Vegas. Now, we did plan our trip during one of the busiest weekends of the year, Labor Day weekend. That said, I booked my schedule more than a month in advance on Chris' website. Since you are required to party at the Palms on the first night, I signed us up for Rain and Moon for Friday. I also selected Tryst for Saturday and XS for Sunday. I knew that these clubs were among the most popular but they were listed as options at the time and I received a confirmation shortly after submitting my request. 

The confirmation did state that the info might change but I didn't hear anything in the following days that would indicate that it had. One week before the trip, I received emails that said the lists for Tryst and XS had been canceled, and we were now on a list for Cathouse at the Luxor for both of those nights. I appreciated the back-up plan, but we already had our hearts set on the other clubs, not to mention dinner reservations at the Wynn for Saturday night since we thought it was where we were going to party later in the evening.

Since there was no way in hell I was going to let my girls down, I quickly contacted another friend who was going on the trip to explain the situation. She worked her own contacts and got us on VIP lists for Tryst and XS on the same nights we originally wanted. 

We did stick with our Friday night plans regardless and went to Rain since DJ Pauly D was spinning. It was a GREAT time.

So will I use the service again or recommend it to friends? Perhaps. Probably. On non-holiday weekends, it's probably a great service. But I'd definitely be wary that things may not work out, so I'd probably come up with my own back-up plan just in case.

This update is LONG overdue. 

Mabel's has become one of my favorite spots and is a solid part of my nightlife rotation. With that said, it has also become the cause and center of many drunken stories! And we all know drunken stories are the best stories...but this is about Mabel's, not my shenanigans. :) 

Music, whether live or spun by a DJ is always stellar. Makes me shake my groove thang and want to party like it's 1999! 

Service, every visit aside from my first has been top notch. Twice I've had table service with Holly as our server. She is amazing! They really take care of you when you have a group/event. Greg, the manager always addresses me by name and says hi when I'm there. Pure class. Also, they have some hotties working there I love to flirt with. (Yes, I'm talking about you, Silas...I may not have twitted you but I Yelped you! ;)

Drinks/Food, fantastic. They have great bubbly here. And bubbly cocktails. Yum. Of course they have all the top shelf liquor. Bottle service is phenomenal. They get creative with your drinks for you if you want and we had this grey goose/soda/ginger drink that was major yum. I've only tried a few of the items on the menu (deviled eggs, scallops, and something else I can't recall, too much bubbly! hehe) but they were all delish and perfect for snacking. I was told they revamped their menu and I have yet to try the new items but look forward to it! 

Now that the weather is cooler, they have started really enforcing dress code. You see a lot of guys in suits and ladies wearing their Saturday night best. Just the way I like it! 

I can't say enough good things about this place. If you haven't been to Mabel's, you are really missing out. Your Scottsdale nightlife will not be complete until you pay them a visit.

I love social media. 

Not.

I've been coming here for over six years and found Mike who manages this Leslie's location to be the best. He knew all his customers, knew their likes and dislikes and always went the extra mile to make them happy. 

Well, along comes a new customer who tries to return something that has been opened without a receipt.  Now Mike doesn't make the rules at Leslie's, he just follows them and says, sorry but without a receipt the best he can do is an exchange. 

Well this customer isn't happy about that and takes to social media and writes a very long One Star review, about how terrible he has been treated. Btw, I see now it's been abridged to a few sentences

Guess what, after nearly twenty years, Leslie fires Mike. Now, I don't know Mike personally, I don't have his cell. But I read the review and decided to come in to tell him not worry about it. He was only doing his job. Well, no Mike. I'm told he was let go because of the incident 

Well Congratulations new Yelp'er, you got someone fired. Nice!

Now here's my story. I came in three weeks ago for some sand for my pool filter. The new Manager Peggy says Leslie's is running a 20% off special and they'll replace and install my sand for $180. Well it sounded too good, so I tell her I'm going to think about it and may I get back to her? No problem, the offer is good until Labor Day. 

Guess what?  I come back last weekend and Peggy is gone, been replaced by a really nice, sharp new Manager Bru-Lynn. Seems Peggy er, is no longer with the company. 

So I tell Bru-Lynn I've decided to take the  Leslie's special and replace my sand. Guess what? Apparently there isn't a Leslie's special going on and Bru-Lynn needs to check with her Regional Supervisor to find out what to do. 

Let me be clear, Bru-Lynn is great! Love her! Think she's the best! And yes, I still wish Mike was here. 

So she checks with her Regional Supervisor and I'm told, they're really very sorry -- did I get anything in writing?

Being a Yelper, I have anticipated my visit to Pizzeria Bianco for over a year.  I finally got the opportunity to go to night!  Fellow Yelper from Houston, Ryan, was in town for work again and invited me out.  We met up at the wine bar next door and got a cheese plate.  Three different kinds of cheese, all really good and tangy!  The thin bread the came with was a bit too crunchy to eat with cheese on it, but tasty nonetheless.  Finally, after a two hour wait, we were called!
We're in!  I'm going to Pizzeria Bianco!!!!
We had a really nice waiter.  He was there when we needed, didn't hover at all.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I had a prosciutto-wrapped melted cheese on a skewer.  There is nothing better in this world than melted cheese!  The skewers were served on a bed of "micro-arugula" and drizzled with olive oil.  Soooooooooooooo yummy!  
We ordered two pizzas to share: The Wiseguy and the Biancoverde.  The Wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it.  Really good!  The Biancoverde, though, was even better.  Three different cheese and again, the micro-arugula.  I'm not a crust person.  I ate the parts with the toppings, but not the edged.  I never do.  The crust was thin and had soaked up some of the natural grease that comes with melted cheese.  Definitely got a wet spot from it!  
I'm full.  I'm exhausted.  I had had a strange and mildly crappy day, and this made it worthwhile.
I'll be back.  To me, definitely worth the wait!  I only wish my Buffalo sister, Jennifer, could have had such a good experience before leaving the Valley.

It's a quite a figurative slap in the face when you support a company through purchasing the product often, promoting the company on websites such as yelp, and getting to know the staff and even establish a relationship with the owner and then get a BRUSH OFF that leaves you feeling snubbed, and worse - unappreciated.

I get it.  The owner wants to enjoy his music.  The SAME music that was playing the previous night at the SAME very loud decibels.  I enjoy loud music - I WORK IN A CLUB!  That's fine!  

NOT at a coffee house.  Everything I loved about this place - the relaxed atmosphere, the chill crowd, the great place to sketch client work and play my DS - gone.  I spent years giving my money to great drinks, sandwiches, and conversation with the overnight baristas.  
Instead is pounding dubstep music, baristas who complain about the owner's repetitious music, and six dollar drinks.  Don't get me wrong - I will pay good money for great product that wants me there.  But after politely inquiring about the volume level being turned down and having a barista tell me no and the owner refusing to even look at me - I'm done.  It's not called entitlement - it's GOOD SERVICE.   I say hello to staff, order my drink, chat for a few minutes, and get to work, sometimes ordering a sandwich or snack.  Apparently, that's not enough to justify the music getting turned down.

Add this to my previous visit when I was accused of owing the store MONEY when they confused me with another customer whose card didn't charge, making me wait for twenty minutes while the staff ran around calling individuals, then finally made me a drink and sent me on my way.  Incredibly frustrating.

I'm frankly just disappointed in this establishment as this used to be a staple in my routine and I'm not returning anytime soon.  I'll give my money to Sambalatte or hell, the ItsAGrind down Durango.


EDIT: Be sure to read the owner's response.  There was nothing polite or professional in response to my review, my opinion, labeled "crying."  Lowering the volume to music that I ENJOY is a little is a "dramatic change" that is selfish and self entitled.  Really?  Again, disappointing on all fronts.

Another fun staycation. I'm just glad it was free! The room was clean and spacious enough for us. We let them know ahead of time that we would need to use the sofa bed and they assured us that it would have a blanket, sheets and pillows, but it didn't. The sofa bed was not comfortable and flimsy. The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare. I didn't plan on cooking a meal anyway so found it useless. There is a small stove-top yet no coffee maker? I didn't get that. At least at a "motel" I would have had a coffee maker and coffee/tea packets complimentary. The fridge was stocked, but I didn't get anything from it since it is overpriced. Be careful when opening these fridges because if you even pick something up to look at, the sensor will know and charge your room for it. 

There is a cafe, bar, starbucks and of course room service for food options, but nothing else as far as I could see for dining. At least there are other hotels within City Center to check out dining options at and of course shopping. I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone but if you get the chance to stay here for free, do it!

Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago "Red Hot" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: "Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!"  You hear that Mike!

I've stayed downtown in Vegas a few times, trying out different hotels each time. And each time I'm left feeling like I probably caught a head full of lice from the bedding that hasn't changed since 1986. The Golden Nugget was so fantastically different though. 

I'd always avoided it before, because I figured if I was going to pay $200 for a room I may as well stay on the strip. But they've since lowered their prices to $99, and I must say, it's quite a bargain.

You know those Westin Heavenly beds? These beds went above and beyond those, so much so that I ended up having the most boring Saturday night ever in Vegas. At midnight I cuddled up with the super soft & fresh bedding and the perfect mattress. Pathetic, I know, but Friday night made up for it.

The casino is pretty much the same as any casino to me, just with slightly higher limits than the rest of the casinos downtown. The pool, however really surprised me. I had no idea something like that existed in this part of Vegas. You can even swim with the fishes (so to speak) in Mandalay Bay.

Thumbs Up:
-Freakin' awesome pool area.
-The beds. We were actually trying to devise a way to bring one home with us.

Thumbs Down:
-No vending machines on the floors. What's that all about? I need my M&M's and Mountain Dew when I'm drunkenly stumbling back to my room!

I was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.

After a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.
http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=napoletana+pizza

After a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!

After dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=LEZcnTOv7H9irlpSm7dMhA

Overall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.

Came here for dinner and left disappointed. It was a 15 minute wait to be seated which didn't bother me, but there were plenty of open tables and booths. We ended up being seated right near the entrance in front of the window. After asking to be moved to one of the other open tables we were told it would be a longer wait. WTH??? Our server was great, but running around taking care of too many tables at once, so I guess they were short staffed. 

I ordered the "Chopped Salad" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce, salami, cheese, tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers, celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing, but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it, but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese, celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!

New look.  New menu.  Same vibe.

Updated contemporary dcor in a dining space where line of sight for celebrity sightings is as important as the LED mood lighting.  High energy, loud, for the young and young at heart.  Quality steaks but, "not your daddy's steakhouse".    

The new menu sees the addition of dry aged beef,  contemporary cuts and steakhouse staples such as a  beautiful braised short rib and a classic 3lb lobster thermidor.

Starters fail to impress.  Secondary to conversation or an after thought kickin it with your buds, the flavors are correct, the presentation OK, no WOW factor.  The fried rock shrimp OK.  Perfectly cooked but the accompanying lemon aioli increases the oily mouth feel.  The lobster pot stickers with bok choy, shitake mushrooms and a chile ginger soy sauce, not memorable.  The king crab and gruyere stuffed shrooms, a tasty bite but the cheese masks the sweetness of the crab.

The steaks.  All USDA prime, wet aged (except he 35 and 50 day dry aged rib eyes), very well trimmed.  Excellent sear.  Even cooking.  Accurate temp.  Standard cuts are, well standard.  Great bone in fillet and porterhouse.  The 35 day dry aged rib steak is tender, and pleasantly nutty with hints of cheesy aroma and a wafting umame finish.  The 50 day, meltingly tender with a pronounced bleu cheese aroma.  Some funkiness at the edges, not for everyone.  The standout, "Barry's Steak".  A simple grilled rib cap.  Tender, packed with flavor.  Served with complementing cipollini onions and shishito peppers.

For entrees, the "Kobe" short rib is excellent.  Not true Kobe beef but, perfectly braised, not stringy, finished with a horseradish crust served with curried root veg and a Cabernet sauce, the earthy flavors marry well.  The lobster thermidor, a classic in every respect.  At three pounds, massive, with firm but still juicy meat enveloped in cream and cheese.  Simply put, good eats.

For sides, the creamed corn, adds a great sweetness to any steak.  The broccoli and cauliflower gratin with a cheddar cheese sauce complements the dry aged steaks umame finish.  The highly touted lobster mashed potato is good but far to rich as a side dish to steaks.  It steals the show.

Very good service.  Steakhouse proper despite the cool vibe of the place.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.

A steakhouse that understands what not having "Las Vegas Blvd" in its address means.  Translated:  it's less expensive, omits baller ingredients but manages to keep the vibe of the Palms.

A modern and elegant Japanese restaurant popping up at the intersection of Flamingo and Decatur was definitely unexpected. But here, Yonaka takes fusion and knocks it out of the park. Too often, Asian fusion takes a wrong turn (at least on my taste buds). But I could just die at the perfection of each and every dish served up here. Its beautiful to look at and even better to taste.

I'll start by saying that I've left every meal feeling light and healthy. Nothing is overladen with fat, sodium or sauce and I've come to prefer eating my uncooked fish here over any other place in Vegas. Fusion or not, this place is the real deal. Top-quality fish and expertly sliced nigiri. We sampled the Toro, Salmon Belly, Saba, Hamachi, Hirame, Scallop and Beef Tongue. The Saba was a winner (I love my cured mackerel) but the Hamachi had to be my favorite flavored with jalapeno miso. The beef tongue wasn't my cup of tea. It seemed overly dry and had a slight jerky quality to it which only added to the oddness of it being served as nigiri.

After that, it was all enjoyable again. We came late and ordered a the Konpa and Brussel Sprouts off the Happy Hour menu (Everyday 5-630 & 11-2). Those brussel sprouts are totally addicting and the innovative combination of salmon, yellowtail and apricots is news to me. Toss in some jalapenos and tomato chips and you've found the must order item on the HH menu (also available on the regular menu w/ a higher price tag). On the main menu, their take on crudo is perfection with candied quinoa. The tuna nicoise, machitaki, umi matsuri, and shirohana were all equally as fabulous. Next trip, I'm trying some of their hot items for sure!

After all of that, I have to rave over the prices. Rave in positivity and gloriousness. As if the already low-prices weren't alluring enough, the HH menu is downright irresistible. Recherche, creative and artistic cuisine in a strip mall on Flamingo is as random as it gets. But as soon as you see the modern and minimalistic design of the interior, you will be impressed from first glance to final taste. 

Basically, everything is amazing. And needless to say, like everyone else I'm beyond fangirl-ing (or fanboy-ing for my male Yelpers) over Yonaka.

Like other Yelpers, I found out about this hole-in-the-wall via another Yelper.  I have had it bookmarked for a while!  I haven't gone before today because they only accepted cash!  You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.  

I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.  

While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalapeos, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.

One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.  

The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....

My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

First I have to rave about why I love Yelp. Without Yelp, I never would have found out about this place. I never would have went. So a big thank you to Shirley B. for the very helpful info and hooking a sister up.

I made an appointment and was the first of the day. My appointment was scheduled for 10am, however Reina didn't show up until right at 10am and had to set up. She apologized and said they should have scheduled me for 10:20 am and not at 10. She apparently doesn't do the scheduling.

I went with a tint and wax. Reina mapped my brow before she started applying the tint. She asked me which tint I wanted and I explained this was my first time. She suggested a color of dark brown but not ebony and so that is what we went with. The tinting process was easy and not long at all. It gave me a nice color and I was happy with it. It could have lasted a little longer I think, since I feel I don't have much tint now and my visit was a week or so ago. I think I could have went darker and had her leave it on longer. But now I know for next time. 

The job Reina did on my wax was really one of the best I have ever had here in Las Vegas. She didn't over wax and worked with the natural shape of my brows. I have a natural high arch and I have a deep scar in one of my eyebrows and this often throws people off. But Reina did something out of this world. She gave me a shape and didn't make my arch more intense. She instead worked with it and provided me with results I loved. 

I didn't feel rushed in her chair. Reina took her time with me and it was a very nice experience. I will be back. I am okay with paying a slight premium if I know I am paying for good services.

Payment was easy. She gives you a card filled out and you take it to the cashier. Worked for me really especially since I had bought some other items from Ulta and was able to pay all together.

"I must.  I must.  I must INCREASE MY BUST!"

And I squeeezed.  And I flexed.  And I waited.  And I waited...

18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZB3upHZY )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfONNfAjyrc ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.

ENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.

The Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.  

Although the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.

The true star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.

When Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as "other" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.

Perhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.

That my ChiaPet will not play fetch.

That I may not "increase my bust" by squeezing my arms across my chest...

But like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand.

I don't write many updated reviews but I believe The Parking Spot deserves some Yelp love.

 I've been using this place for about 4 years and the service is consistently superior. There's covered parking so your car is not baking in the sun so you're less likely to come back with an unbearably hot interior. You get a USA TODAY paper when you enter the facility and a bottled water for each occupant of your car when you leave the facility. That water really hits "The Spot" after being subjected to the heat when you're coming back from a temperate climate. You can sign up for thespotclub which you can link your credit card for payment and keep track of the points you use which can be redeemed for free parking. In fact, I called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because I changed my email address and couldn't get into the site online. For some reason my points were gone too. But they restored my 2,000 plus points within minutes. I guess they thought I was inactive since I hadn't been on the website in years.

All the shuttle drivers are friendly and take care of your luggage (commercial here, Please tip your drivers). They give you a card to remind you which parking space you parked at such as I211. They respond quickly at the terminal when you call and say you are ready for pick up. I usually fly out of terminal 3 so they pick you up at door number 5 on the North side. The vans are air conditioned, what more do you need.

Also, the people that are at the booths are excellent as well. When you call, they know how to answer your question properly. They direct you where to park and take care of your payments at the booth. The Parking spot advertises in the magazines in front of you on your airplane. So you can usually find a coupon for 20% off. I believe a 24 hour stay is $10.95 without coupon. Also, you can get three hours of parking by showing your AAA Card. So if you want to meet people inside the terminal and don't want to pay for airport parking this is what you do. And if you decide to park for more than 3 hours you can use your AAA Card for a 10% discount. They have another service where they'll wash your car by the time you get back. 

There's a Parking Spot 1 and a Parking Spot 2. This review is for Parking Spot 1 on Washington street.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. 

3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!

I was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  

The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.

I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.

For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.

My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  

As I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

Jol Robuchon was the choice for the girlfriend and my dinner on our first night in Vegas.  While there were plenty of other, much less expensive, restaurants I could've taken my girlfriend, unbeknownst to her, I planned to propose to her over dinner and the occasion called for something special.  Upon stepping through the door and up until we left several hours later, Jol Robuchon exuded style, class, opulence, and Franco/Vegas charm in all facets of its operation. We elected to have the 16 (or so)-course degustation menu.  The team of wait staff was off the charts with its informed, surgically precise, personable, but never "stuffy" service throughout our meal.  Likewise, the sommelier was spot on with her wine recommendations (we had two splits, one white and one red), which were surprisingly affordable and very well suited complements to the varied courses of food received.

Our meal started off with a bread cart, which was more aptly described as a boulangerie on wheels.  Every type of French style bread or roll was present and was served with amazingly creamy butter and an exotic sea salt.  After the bread, came our culinary Tour de Force.  We received the following...

La Cerise - Cherry gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice cream
La Tomate - Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gele topped with mozzarella  
Le Caviar - Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream served as a surprise
La Saint-Jacques - Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh coriander
Les Crustacs - Truffled langoustine ravioli, Sea urchin prepared in "chaud-froid" with anise juices, spiny lobster served atop spinach in a black Malabar pepper sauce
Les Petits Pois - Sweet green pea veloute with vegetable aroma and hints of mint
Le Foie Gras - Seared foie gras with red berries and kumquat compote
Le Bar - Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks
Le Boeuf - Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment
Le Broccolini - Broccollini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto
Le Pop-Fraise - Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Ros Champagne cream and soursop sorbet
Le Dome - Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce.

Our meal closed with the Le Moka-Le Th, a cart filled with over 35 different Mignardises.  It was the proverbial sweet finale to an amazing meal!  Every course was beautiful in its presentation, but easily matched by the complex, yet exquisite flavors delivered with every bite.  In truth, I can't pick a favorite course since they were each amazing in their own unique way.  It was definitely not traditional French bistro fare.  

Jol Robuchon was the perfect choice for our most special occasion.  I highly recommend it for yours.  And if you were still wondering...she did say, "Yes".

Consider me a big fan!  

I was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   

Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. 

The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  

But man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.

We ended up at the airport with a few hours to kill, and wanted to have a decent meal at a sitdown restaurant, versus a fast-paced sandwich shop.  We were in the C Terminal, and Zinc looked like the best option.  The menu was pricey, but that wasn't completely surprising being in an airport and our expectations of the food quality.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The French onion soup was a good version, but for $14 it needed to be better than just good.  And that was the highlight of the meal.  The steak frites were a complete let down.  It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare.  I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none.  And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew.  The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless.  The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak.  I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal.

I would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed.  Just plan on eating somewhere else first, and maybe hitting Zinc for a couple of cocktails and skipping the food.

I love Mom and Pop run businesses. 

I was driving along Chandler Boulevard, saw the sign "Family Run Business" and decided to stop.  

There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter. 

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in. 

But if you are tired of the "same old, same old" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change. 

Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeo corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99. 

I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ "A-Okay" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL

Regardless of where you are on Saturday, this is definitely the place to be on Sunday! Well, for brunch that is.

From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh "English tea party" inspired restaurant. 

The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!

In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.

Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!

However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!

So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!

Happy Eats!

When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. 

Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. 

The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook 
Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. 

All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) 

Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. 

I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.

Thanks Denny's for saving my night.

What a let down this place was.

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

This is another long overdue review that I've been needing to write in a bad way. I actually feel guilty keeping this information all to myself for so long! This place couldn't be more deserving of a fantastic review from yours truly.

I come to Spa Mio mostly for blowouts but I've had massages and facials done here as well. I like that I don't even need to request a specific person as I know when I'm coming to Spa Mio, everyone that works here does a great job! It's a rare thing for me to be able to say that about a salon/spa. The fact that all of their hairdressers/therapists are talented saves me time and headaches because then I don't have to work around a specific person's schedule and can just book in right away. Whomever does their hiring is on it! In addition to being great at what they do, all of the people that work here are nice and friendly and always a pleasure to deal with. I've never had a bad experience and I've been coming here a lot and for a long time, as you can see from my number of checkins listed above.

They offer discounts for locals which is awesome! They also have a shop in the front where you can buy hair and skincare products, flat irons & other styling tools, bath bombs, even cute jewelry. Come a little early so that you can have a look.

Without hesitation, I can recommend Spa Mio to all of my fellow Yelpers. They also offer many other services here including nails (which I have not tried yet) but I can assume their employees are on par with the rest since they're always busy. For more information on all they have to offer visit:

Five stars!

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  

I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing "a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ..."  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, "Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  

The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. 

So Three and half Stars+, A-Okay!

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

Jack Norworth wrote be best sports related song in 1908, coincidentally it was the year the Cub's won their last World Series Championship.  Does anyone remember the "The Baseball Polka"...no just like the 1907 World Series Championship.

Take me out to the ball game

Take me out with the crowd

Buy me some peanuts and Crackerjack

I don't care if I never get back

Let me root...root...root

For the Cubbies(remix version)

If they don't win it's a shame

For it's one...two...three strikes you're out

At the old ball game

Spring training facilities in the last few years in the metro Phoenix area have put out a few new stadiums and none topped the Salt River Fields (Rockies & Diamondbacks) until Cub's Park.  This park has so much seating which is great when you compare it to Hohokam Stadium.  Parking is so much better!  Oh yeah, they have tons of bathrooms.  

I was lucky enough to get a ticket to open day which was also the opening of the park.  I snapped a few photos that are attached to this review.  The stadium is beautiful.  It does have many cues that remind you of Wrigley Field.  If there is one thing that I could tell Tom Ricketts to add to this park, it would be adding a vinyl wrap that looks like a brick wall in the outfield around the advertisement to emulate Wrigley's outfield wall.

Food and Beer, check.  The thing that stood out, no pizza sold inside the park.  My apologies if I missed it.  Most people are pointing out that there is no Old Style sold.   I can go a few hours without to watch a game here.  The food is just the normal stuff you will find at most spring training stadiums.  The one feature that I find way cool is that you will find three food trucks parked on the right field side next to the Dos Gringos tent along with some picnic tables, nice touch!  Chicago deep dish pizza places take note, you could make a killing by just investing in a food truck and getting a spot here!

If you choose to buy a general admission ticket, there are many great views that are standing room if you do not want to tan yourself in the outfield.  Let me say again, tons of seating.  The things that are works in progress are minimal and not worth mentioning and know the Cub's have a winner here.  I hope they use this park for fall ball too.

Well, if you are old enough, you might remember Avis Car Rental's slogan; "We Try Harder"  In many ways, that could describe Del Taco.

Taco Bell has been trying to improve it's image recently, by updating it's menu items with offerings from "Chef Lorena Garcia's authentic Latin recipe".  So you might think they are taking Chipotle seriously.  Oh contraire mon frere!  I believe they see Del Taco in their rear-view mirror. 

Over the last couple of years, Del Taco has been upgrading their menu items, too.  It's not just a taco place.  Besides Mexican inspired food items, they also sell cheeseburger (single, double and triple), shakes, potato poppers, crinkle cut fries, as well as chili fries.  So, they are closer to Carl's Jr Green Burrito, than Taco Bell.

Another difference, is their reliance on Text Messaging to send you coupons, or specials.  Here are some recent examples: "Get a free small fries w/ any Crispy Shrimp Taco or burrito purchase."  Or, "It's Taco Tuesday @ Del Taco starts @ 3pm. Get 3 regular tacos for $1.09 3pm till 11pm."  Taco Bell is more focused on Facebook to get their message out. How pass.

The food at Del Taco is good and seem reasonably priced as compared to any of the other taco or burger boys.  They also serve breakfast, which is very good.  This location is near The Home Depot.  It is clean, friendly enough and the line moves fast.  What else could you ask for in a fast food joint?  

I've posted two Tips which you might want to try.  First, use the Microsoft Tag scanner App on your phone to become part of Del Taco's email Club.  Second, "Text Club" to 60259 to join Del Taco's text club for food and special offers. 

So in summary, Del Taco is Three Stars, A-OK

"It doesn't matter what my profit margin is, I own the f@#$ing place."
~Old Man Harrison

This place reminds me the Big Mac that seen on TV Commercial looks big and juicy. However, when you actually go get one is totally opposite from the ads.  It located almost out of nowhere location in downtown Las Vegas.  This is a Tourist Hot Spot, the store sure know how's to take advantage of their fame...  Almost half all stuff in the pawnshop is their merchandise; many of them can found on-line.

This pawnshop had the same layout and shape like typical one, but it got army of staff both inside and outside.  It got its own parking lot which is nice, but won't enough in the weekend.  The reason many people wanted to come here, is really wanted a chance to see the real Pawn Star cast, but reality they almost never here at all.  Only any real change you get to meet them is to win a raffle. 

There are some cool stuff in the shop, but that's very small of collection from what it show in TV.  Their main business in the shop is to sell jewelry, after all they name of the store is Gold and Silver ! 

I don't recommend come in the weekend, there will be always a very long line.  Best go there during weekday when the line is usually is much shorter.  One of the nice thing they did in the shop but is really mostly for PR, they had a machine that let you create a free E-Card so you can share to Facebook or just send it to email.  The machine is very slow and the camera will capture many other people in the background that is not from your group.  Camera is allow in the store except in the cashier section. 

I won't come back here unless those cast member are actually there which most likely not unless you won the raffle which I don't I think I did.  Don't just come to Vegas because you only want goes to this shop, there is far more things to do in the Sin City.  This is more like onetime thing for 99% of people.

I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a "Heart Shaped Pizza" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added "Cheesy Bread" and "Cookie Dough" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.

Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. 

1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was "that's how its served here" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. 
When I asked her why the Merlot she said "Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.

2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.

3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.

All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.

It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.

My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.

Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.
Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup. 
 "Why is that?" Brenda asked.  
 "Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy," replied the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's 7:54," Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.)
 "It says 8:00pm on my clock," "says the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,"  I chimed in.
  "Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around."

Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to "hang around," why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?
Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.
This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

I'm such a big fan of Guy Fieri & his shows! 
After hearing that he has his own restaurant in Vegas, I knew I had to check it out!

Definitely that "All-American" feel to it! Live TV, loud music, and a great space! 
Upon walking in, the greeting and the hostesses, I felt, were awkward..
We were seated and our server was Olga. She was pleasant and attentive!

Now about the food..
Portions are big, quality is good, but the items don't scream "to die for"..
We had :
* Java Guava - guava juice cocktail with a touch of alcohol
* Parmaggedon Wings - brined and roasted Parmesan wings served with marinara sauce -- very tender, moist, flavorful wings!
* Triple T Fries - truffle fries sprinkled with truffle served with truffle sauce -- def not as truffley as it sounds..
* Drunken Fish Tacos - tilapia, avocado and fresh veggies -- nothing too impressive..
* Mac N Cheese Burger - bacon, mac n cheese served on a brioche bun -- DELICIOUS!
* Mexican Churros - fried churros with two dips : spicy chocolate & dulce de leche (my fave of the two!)
 
Two other things -- they have big chunks of squared ice in the drinks which lasted forever, kept my water nice and cold! AND the side of ranch we had was AMAZING! Just the little, simple things that topped off the experience!

Overall pleased with the service and food! Wouldn't mind coming back to try the other menu items!

Bachi has a breakfast restaurant?! What!! Obsessed with Bachi Burger as it is, and super disappointed by their ramen, I'm glad HLK lives up to the Bachi name. 

My friends and I are fatties and had the Bella farms foie gras de canard (torchon, jelly, marcona almonds, cornichons, cranberry walnut bread) as a starter. Delicious! It has a pretty thick layer of duck fat on top as well. Yeah, as disgusting as you may feel thinking about eating straight up fat, who cares? Spread that stuff on! 

I had the wild mushroom hash (potato, kale, gruyere, egg, fried onions, bechamel) as well as the corned beef hash (potato, brussel sprouts, onion, egg, bechamel) . No, not all too myself, I'm not that much of a fatty. Disappointed a bit, because none of us were asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. On both hashes they came over hard, which I hate. I love runny yolks, don't take that away from me! Especially on a hash. But other than that, they were both delicious. Corned beef had good flavor. 

Friend got the braised short ribs loco modo ( two eggs, fried rice, onion rings, orange lentil gravy). Looked bomb. Meat was tender. Braised for thirty six hours. 

Also tried the crispy sweet chili chicken and waffle (apple bacon, brussel sprouts, green onion waffle, curry butter). Chicken was very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. Unfortunately they only put it on one of the pieces. Waffle was ok. Butter ess definitely the high point of the waffle. You get three choices of syrups (maple, coconut, blueberry). 

Overall, good experience. Great service. Thanks Adrianna! Definitely a come back spot.

Wow.  Everyone is right-this place really is a dive.  Stained seats, trash on the floor, and is that bird poop on the screen?  Maybe I should have washed my car first.  Seriously, maybe Scottsdale 6 is a dive, but what would make for a "nice" drive-in?  Aren't they all the same?

Then there's the complaints about the sound system.  Are you kidding me?  Compared to the days of hanging a speaker off your window, listening to the movie through your FM radio is like the most advanced sound system in the universe.  

I hadn't been to the drive in since the late 70's, as a child of course, and not a lot has changed...except the price.  $6.25 for a double feature, and new movies to boot!  I didn't visit the snack bar as we brought our own freshly popped corn with a touch of sea salt and a little butter..mmm.  I also didn't visit the bathrooms because I still have some degree of bladder control.    

My complaints...total train wreck getting in.  Double-sided ticket booths with only one attendant working both sides.  Cash only when it's quicker to swipe a card than make change.  Since the first showing for all movies is 7:45, it might be better to have the lanes correspond to the movie you're seeing with overhead signs identifying the radio station and the screen number.  As it is, the attendants have to go through all that with you as well as directions to your screen.

I would also suggest if you want to check the movies online you don't use the website listed here, it only gives you the times of each movie--not which movies are paired on the same screen.  Instead, use http://www.movietickets.com/house_detail.asp?house_id=3998

I like that I can zone in and out of the movie and ask my husband to explain it to me without disturbing anyone, even if he doesn't.  I like that I can recline my seat, and not have my knees buckle under when I get up after 2 hours of sitting in the same position.  I like that I don't need a payday loan to buy a Coke.  And I like that I could go to the movies with a cough!  This little conversation was a bonus:

Me:  Are you watching HANNAH MONTANA? (on another screen)
Him:  No.
Me:  You're looking over there.
Him:  I was just looking around.
Me:  I can't wait to post this in my Yelp review.
Him:  You better not, I was just looking around.
Me:  Okay, I won't.

I can't wait to go again!

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

So glad I tried this place! El Regio is similar to Roberto's, but way better! Upon walking in I was greeted by the man behind the counter who pointed out the menu board and was helpful in going over it with me and hubby. I told him I purchased a $10 for $20 yelp deal and he took it with no problems. 

I ordered an "Adobada Taco" priced at $2.39, "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.49 and a small drink priced at $1.25 with free refills. All our food was made fresh to order. The adobada taco was the main star for sure. It packed a lot of awesome flavor! Everything about this taco was just fresh and tasty. The quesadilla wasn't greasy at all. The tortilla had good flavor and the amount of cheese was perfect. Hubby ordered a "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $ $4.89 and a "Shredded Beef Taco" priced at $1.99 and he enjoyed his a lot too. 

Next to the cash register is a salsa and veggie bar. I used the green sauce for my quesadilla and it was so good! If you are in the area before 9 am you can get a breakfast burrito for only $2.49! There is a digital board on the front window promoting their current specials so I don't know  how long it will go on for, but it is the current special right now. 

El Regio is located on Tenaya near Ann Rd just off of the 95. They are open 7 days a week.

Say what?!?!?! Great Steak & Fry (great steak & potato company to some) is gone??? As I walk in the food court of the Meadows Mall, I am sad to see all the changes. That is what happens with time, but I don't like change much and only seeing 2 of the same places (chains of course) still there is just a shame. There used to be more locally owned family businesses in the food court. 

Hubby was off to eat at Johnny Rocket's so I decided to give this new cheesesteak (cashier says they have been open a few months) place that took the spot of GS&F out. I ordered the "Philly Cheesesteak" priced at $6.79 and $3.99 to add cheese fries and a drink. The cheesesteak had on it steak, grilled onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and american cheese. They have a variety if fresh toppings, so I decided to go all out west coast on this cheesesteak! I had lettuce (ended up removing most of it), tomato and mayo added. The only thing missing was some fresh avocado! I enjoyed the cheesesteak. The cheese fries were actually good, but the total price being around $12 seems steep when I can get a bigger cheesesteak and fries for a little less just down the street at Pop's. I liked the food, but wouldn't eat here again unless I had a coupon and I would have to already be shopping at the mall. The cashier mentioned signing up for the e-club to get coupons and deals.  The employees were friendly and even gave me a free refill of cherry pepsi.

Bachi Burger...I'm a huge fan. This is one of my favorite places for gourmet burgers. 
My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth. 

We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries. 

Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.

The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead.

(^o^) "Best Free Show In Vegas Hands Down" (^o^)

Bellagio Fountain Show is easily the best free attraction in Las Vegas Strip.  The fountain is a whopping 8-acres manmade lake.  It cost as much as 40 million to build; the fountain created by WET.  I think the fountain has something to do with the cost of the Bellagio high room rate.  The fountain had help Bellagio putting itself above most other 5 stars hotel in the strip.  Vehicles and pedestrians pass by the strip will notice the huge fountain plus its famous water show.

Other the size, the water blast is also remarkable.  It shoots as high as 460 feet, which is over 40 stories high!  At top of that, it got great lighting and music to make a perfect harmony. People of all age would enjoy this fountain, at first it appear this would be a great for romantic setting.  But kids would love this since the water blast is so cool.  

You can great view from the Paris Hotel, few of the outdoor restaurant in Bellagio, and of course the room in the Bellagio themselves. A Las Vegas trip is not completed without a visit to the Fountain Show in Bellagio; I think if they added more recent music would be a nice refresh or color led.  The show run every 15 minutes from 3pm or earlier depend if weekend or holiday is. Which is a good crowd control.

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.

They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.

Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.

Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings.

It was a little quiet at work so I decided it was a good day to have an offsite lunch. I yelped new spots in Chinatown.

Yes, this is the old Anime place, and the maid place which I did not get to try. It is next door to Kaya Sushi. 

We ordered the Roti to start and it was one of the best in Las Vegas, next to Island Malaysian and Veggie House. It was freshly sauteed and fluffy. The sauce was slightly spicy but nothing too fancy (because the Roti was the star). 

I read the restaurant was opened by Thai people so I was hesitant about ordering anything not Thai or Southeast Asian, but my Ramen craving was still going strong, so I had to try their Tonkatsu Ramen. The ramen was the thin noodle kind, with a really tasty, savory and sticky broth. The pork was tender, sliced really thin, and was surprisingly good. The major difference was that there were fried shallots added, and that totally changed the flavor profile, in a good way.   

I was also able to try a slice of the roasted pork from another noodle soup dish, and again, it was surprisingly good, sliced thin and flavorful. 

Side note, their entire menu is pictorial, so that made it really easy to pick what to order! 

I would absolutely come back... to try the other menu items, as well as the Roti again!

Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.

My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said "dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook."  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.

So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.

Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

FOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****Stars

I'll be back.

Seems like pubs done by celebrity chefs are all the rage now.  I think it was a smart idea by Rick Moonen to change the upstairs of RM Seafood to this.  It's a really cool space with interesting furniture and displays.  I have no idea what steampunk is though.  I can only imagine Joey Ramone in a sauna.  

We chose to sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders and get their opinions on drinks etc.  It was also a treat to see them make some of these concoctions.  I know quite a few Yelpers that love the whiskey and this should be a spot to check out.  I will definitely try the smoked whiskey next time.  Check out some of the other people's pics.  

My wife wasn't into any of the specialty cocktails and opted for the appletini (ha fn ha).  But they used actual apple instead of that Pucker BS so it tasted as legit as an appletini could.  I went with some long titled cocktail called "Mario Warped the something something" which featured egg white, tequila and thyme.  It tasted like a margarita made by a mad scientist.  I also had a bottle of an Austrian lemon beer I'd never had before which was super refreshing.  

The chicken liver pate was just OK.  One of the bartenders tried to build up the fact that the pate was "like in this totally cool jar".  That'd be interesting if Thomas Keller hadn't already been doing that up the street at Bouchon since they opened.  I prefer duck liver pate any day of the week.  I'd skip this.  

Interesting idea with the inside out French onion grilled cheese but I feel like it totally missed the mark on both ends.  I'd rather have an excellent grilled cheese sandwich or a robust and cheesy French onion soup than this combo.  This is a skip too.

We both really liked the Lamb Osso Bucco Greek style.  Two gloriously tender shanks of lamb with orzo on the bottom that was swimming in the lamb juice.  Anthony M's picture of it is way better than mine.

Shockingly the best thing we had was dessert.  2 of the bartenders kept raving and raving about the green tea panna cotta with pineapple and macadamia nut cookie. It was definitely all that.     

I am rounding up on Rx Boiler Room.  It was more like 3.683712 stars but I think some of the dishes we passed on this first go around will be things I look forward to trying soon.  

Hey Rick!  How about a happy hour??

Lessaiz Les Bon Temps Rouler in Viva Las Vegas,

Came here for dinner with the BFF's to celebrate all of our belated birthday's. I've actually dined at several of Emeril's establishment and have been here twice before.  Each time I enjoyed a very good meal here.  

We started off with drinks and shared 2 different salads which were very good.

Pork chop was my entree http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#LC_f_i6ryK2FE9A0o1iX_A  This sounded really good and it was very good.   A nice double cut pork chop atop a very creamy and flavorful mashed potato. The sauce that accompanied the chops was perfect I wanted more of it.  It was a pretty big piece of pork chop.

Banana cream pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#JmSeIq-NF3TojwbkY71V9A  For dessert it is a must for me to get the Banana cream pie.  I first had it at Delmonico's in New Orleans and ever since the first bite many many years ago, if its on the menu at any Emerils resto I'm ordering it.  As you can see it not just all custard but it has slices of fresh banana's and the custard is firmer.  Its just tasty bite after bite!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#4j2ZIrDR8_5Jkwid9ahUqA

Eyes ~ Lots of happy diners!
Nose ~ I smell something yummy.
Ear ~ Plenty of chatter but not too loud 
Mouth ~ Pork chops and Banana cream pie goodness!.
Tummy ~ So very stuffed!

I grew up in Las Vegas. I was not introduced to the concept of "Last Call" until I moved to Ohio at 17 years old. It was a huge shock. I couldn't believe other people had the right to tell me when I could or couldn't purchase delicious alcoholic beverages. Despite the fact that I was 17 years old and I was therefore legally forbidden to buy alcoholic beverages for at least another 3 years, this "Last Call" business really chapped me.

I'm typically not ready to end the night just because Mr. Last Call wants to be a party pooper and rear his ugly head. I usually plan for this likely event beforehand, but I'm not going to say I'm a stranger to jumping in a cab at 1:50 screaming at the driver with the urgency some may reserve for labor pains that I need a liquor store PRONTO! This leads to me overpaying for the cab, overpaying for liquor, and generally overtesting my patience because apparently to some cab drivers "PRONTO" means "Drive Safely and Obey all Posted Speed Limits". Pussies.

This, my friends, is where the beauty of a liquor store with a built-in bar comes in. This way, when last call comes around, I merely need to mosey on down the hall to make my after-hours selection, and patiently ask my cab driver to take me to the destination of my choice. Everybody wins!

The bar has a great selection of beers on draft. On our last visit, which just happened to be Halloween night, there was not one but TWO different Pumpkin drafts. The ever popular Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, and another one which I don't quite remember the name of, but it tasted like pumpkin pie in a pint glass. I was tempted to ask for whipped cream. 

We experimented with several different beverages throughout the course of the night. I awoke the next morning to find a note written to myself in my phone that merely said:

los abbey angel share is the most delciousber of allll time

As you can clearly read, Lost Abbey Angel's Share is the most delicious beer of all time. They serve it here, for $13 a glass. It's totally worth it though. It's extremely strong and tastes like a combination of chocolate and jesus. Another win-win.

I'll definitely be back to Taste of Tops. Cab drivers everywhere rejoice.

Despite being a bit of a sword fight (with a guy to girl ratio of about 5 to 1), XS was still a great club. It helped that I was with my wife and didn't have to compete with the testosterone throngs thrusting against brave ladies that venture onto the dance floor. The entrance fee on Monday night was cheap for XS standards at $30 for dudes and $20 for girls. But, we noticed that most single girls just got in for free if they looked hot with skimpy outfits. Olivia was jealous until I pointed out she was getting in for free (since I was paying ... ).

Once inside, XS was smaller than expected, but it still works. One major positive was the ultra clean bathrooms. The dance floor heated up about 15 minutes after we got there and we staked out a spot in the middle near the front. Morgan Page took over as DJ around 1:30 a.m. and then it became so packed you could literally not move to the beat without bumping others. Eventually you just kind of get used to the close quarters and people touching you on all sides. Hopefully, you'll know one or two of them.

If you don't get a table, there's no place to really relax except outside by the pool or squeezing in with another group. Because of the sausage-fest, ladies should have no problems making several friends. The bartenders were fast and made decent drinks. They ain't cheap, but you didn't go to XS to save money, right.

XS lived up to expectations and was a great way to dance off the Vegas buffet till the morning.

This Jersey Mike's in located in kind of a cramped shopping center. I've stopped by this location a couple times now and and am glad to have a decent place to grab a sandwich for lunch when in the area. The employees inside are nice. I don't always remember my Shore Points Card, which accumulates points with each of my purchases towards free food, so it's nice that I can just give my phone number and they can look it up easy that way. I don't know if this is the only location that does it because I haven't seen it at other locations, but currently they offer a daily lunch special from 11 am to 3 pm that costs $6.99 and gets you any regular sub and drink. 

I like the "Original Italian" and "Club Sub" the best. Mike's way of course! The Italian has 6 different meats. I'd rather pay a couple dollars more to eat subs here rather than Port of Subs or Subway because the meats, breads and cheeses just taste better. They also had some "Chocolate Chip Cookies" which I never knew they had, so I got some and they are good!

You can place your order over the phone or online (you have the option to enter your shore rewards points online) for convenient pick-up.

A twenty dollar sandwich got me a red room upgrade, a sick view of Bellagio Fountains, a roll away bed, and a DAMN good time in Sin City!

Its quite simple actually.  Simply fold a twenty dollar bill in between your credit card and ID and ask if there are any available upgrades.  Obviously a little small talk is in order.  Use your charm and personality, but more importantly don't forget the magic words, "we'll take care of you!" to help seal the deal. 

All you really have to do is ask for what you want and let the sandwich do the rest.  Ask for ridiculous upgrades like a indoor gym, a penthouse suite, or mirrored ceilings.  Anything to make them laugh and break up the monotony of checking in boring tourist after boring tourist.  

After some small talk, you'll see them banging away on their keyboard.  Continue to chat with them and let them know how excited you are about the weekend and that all you want to do is have a good time.  Heck, invite them up to have a drink and let them know that you think they're awesome. TRUST ME...It pays to be nice!

Before you know it they'll show you a picture of the red room and let you know that its typically a $40 upgrade per night but for you its on the house.  If you're really nice and he or she likes you, then they'll probably ask if you need a roll away bed ($30 upgrade) and late check-out too. I took advantage of both, with a total savings for a 2 night stay reaching a whopping $110.  Can I get an Amen!

The TDS (twenty dollar sandwich) will pretty much work at any hotel or club so use it wisely and you'll be livin large baby!

FABU-nothing-LOUS-than-five-stars!!

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)

My friends and I were ready to party, and decided to hit up Haze, just inside the new Aria/City Center. With the VIP passes in hand, we lined up and waited about 15 minutes before entering. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=AUKfTd2nLQcqk8Mn1hqc4g  I was impressed at how orderly the lines were, as the ropes separated the lines for the Girls, Guys, and VIPs or Bottle Service. There were bouncers, who answered questions and directed people where they should stand.

So, we have been the first to enter, but didn't mind since we scoped out a place to get situated as we opted out of the bottle service. Check out the tables with the bottle service http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=HuQqKeF5rkkcSQ-JpftF-g  

Club wasn't as big as I expected with two floors, with the smallish dance area on the first floor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=Ok_8epfJHBDz0ZLOOP0VmQ
Music was decent, with a mix of hip hop, r&b, etc., and my friends and I busted a groove. It eventually did get super packed and hot, so Li and I decided to mosey over to the downstairs bar area. There we hung out with our friends, and proceeded to even make new ones who were kind enough to buy us drinks :0  From what I recall, the wait for a drink was never longer than 5 minutes.
 
Bathrooms are clean and has all the girly necessities (hair spray, mints, etc.,) and thankfully, there was never a long line. 

Haze is a cool club, and the week before Leighton Meester made an appearance, and the day after I hit up Haze, Common was appearing. Duoh, talk about bad timing. Fail! Oh well, whatcha gonna do?

Anywho, I had a blast with my friends (old and new) and stayed out partying til 4am. I recommend getting the VIP passes and lining up early. The fellas should be prepared to pay the cover. As with most LV bars and clubs, drinks are not cheap. However, you might be lucky (like a few people I know) to not have to drop any cashola for one drink the entire evening.  

Cheers and party on til the break of dawn!

AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. 

Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was "too drunk."  "Excuse me?" I asked her, "I've had 2 drinks!"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, "No." I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my "problem." I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, "That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here." That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, "you're just planning on taking the cab to your car." I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.

I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.

I wanted to like this gym. I really did. It's gorgeous, after all, and their salespeople do a great job of talking it up. 

First off, I have a very busy and ever-changing schedule. This probably made me a poor candidate for this gym to begin with, as their hours and classes are limited. Anyway, I visited the gym in April and was impressed with the sales rep, the facility, and the quality of trainers. I had very limited time that day (the story of my life!), so I filled out a little card (I did not complete any membership paperwork) and left to carry on with the day.

In May, I began the stressful and lengthy process of home buying and got even busier! David Barton Gym began charging my credit card, and I was fine with that.

Come June, I'm still absolutely slammed and haven't been able to get to the gym. At this point, I had been getting repeated phone calls from these clowns asking me to come in and fill out the paperwork. With everything I had going on, David Barton Gym wasn't a priority. I was fine with them charging me the membership fee. I had no issues. But what did they do? They threatened me. They started telling me that I would be charged MORE because I hadn't filled out the paperwork...

Long story short, I decided this wasn't the place for me due to bad customer service and asked them to simply stop charging my card since I had never officially become a member anyway . I didn't ask for any refunds whatsoever. What did they do this time? They refused to stop charging me unless I filled out the membership paperwork. 

Huh? OK...well, long story short again: Silly me capitulated and signed the membership paperwork along with the cancellation paperwork at the same time, again never asking for a refund. However, David Rivera (who is great, by the way - I feel sorry that he works for that company because he deserves better) insisted that I accept a refund for May. That was a nice gesture. I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.

Fast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.

When I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.

Making a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. 

I am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem.

Yay! I just happen to be their 100th reviewer!

First of all, shame on me for not coming here sooner because they have been here at least a year and half in this nice location across from the Cannery Casino. Old School Pizzeria is just that. Old school. They make everything from scratch right in front of you. 

I ordered the Rosemary Garlic Knots and a Monster slice of The Carnivore. 

The Rosemary Garlic Knots were exquisite! I have had garlic knots before but these babies are now the standard I will judge others by. Let me describe it. Please have a bib or a napkin ready because you will be drooling. These are not your basic garlic knots. These knots are baked with actual rosemary leaves and real garlic cloves tossed in a light olive oil. I had them sit in the oven a little longer so it would make the outside even more crispy. When you take that first bite, it's comparable to one of those scenes you would see in any basic movie when somebody has a flashback and relives all those fun, awesome times, all in fast forward because by then that first bite is on its way to your stomach. Oh, and don't forget about the ranch dipping sauce that comes with it. Definitely did not come from a bottle. I assume they made it fresh because it was really creamy and made me want to drink it.

As for the monster slice of The Carnivore, the description is very fitting. If you refer to my pic, I put a pepper shaker right next to it so you can comprehend its dimensions. Now I have had good thin crust New York style pizza before, but this crust was SOURDOUGH! Now sourdough bread by itself I am into, but as the crust for the pizza? Stupendous! As you can assume by the name, it has all the meats they have available. From my recollection it had sausage, ham, chicken, pepperoni, and bacon. Usually when I get to the end crust, I just put it aside, but this crust was so good especially dipped in the ranch dressing, that it would make other sourdough bread jealous.

As an honorary mention, I gotta say that their bathroom is nicely decorated, clean, and has a fresh scent to it. It's so nice that I hope to God that none of those idiot hooligans jack it up with their sharpies and scratch things up. Memo to those low lifes: What kind of jerk are you to vandalize things and make it a sight for sore eyes? Anyways, sorry I kind of strayed off the beaten path there.

So now that you got this far in my review, I just want to reiterate one thing. Whatever you get here, make sure the Rosemary Garlic Knots is one of them. The pizza comes in a very close second because it compliments the former. Sometimes, you just gotta go old school! Old School Pizzeria that is!

My son in law & daughter treated myself and his mom to a Mom's night out down at the Celebrity Theater.  Now this review isn't about the show we saw, but more on the venue. 

I have lived in the valley for 13 years and never knew this place existed, crazy right?

We arrived an hour early so we went down into the club area and son in law & I had some drinks, this is a cool little waiting spot, it did fill up quickly, but didn't feel over crowded. 

Then the doors opened, and I have to say, I enjoyed the set up, we were only 6 rows back from the stage, but after looking around I can't honestly say there isn't a bad seat in the house, and this is a smaller more intimate venue where the stage turns, so everyone can get a great view.  

The seats were comfortable, the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back!

I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's, but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a "Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a "Kids Pizza" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! 

They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program.

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more. 

They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location.

I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.

But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?

Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. 

I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one.

Good, straight forward fish house / steakhouse.  Best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary "pod" in the middle of Crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  Unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  "I'm hungry after all YOUR shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat".

With the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. No special sauces, no veg.  Just fish or beef on a plate.  

Portions are large.  Unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  They are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  You can get them anywhere.  

Fish is expertly cooked to order.  The thick cut fillet of pan roasted Chilean sea bass and salmon are excellent.  Cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  Both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  

Good quality prime steaks.  Decent aging.  Good selection of bone in cuts.   Sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in Vegas.  The bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  No complaints.  

For sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the lobster mashed potatoes.  Chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  I could eat either an a main and be happy!  

Solid wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Sometimes "a kiss is just a kiss..."  and that's fine by me.

We splurged at Mix. And we splurged in style. 

The photos of the truly glamorous restaurant located on the 64th floor of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay speak for themselves: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA?select=X7QyN6HCtkdcyuKjmp0yPg

The incredible views and stunning modern decor alone are worth the visit. The superb service, fantastic wine & cocktail menu and amazing food complete the experience. 

Our server, Lee Christopher, had a wonderful way about sharing his knowledge and love for renowned French Chef Alain Ducasse's culinary creations at Mix. The way he described the dishes were so colorful, and I was certain that no matter what we ended up ordering, it would be just as amazing as it sounded.

The menu features French and American dishes, including Alain Ducasse's signature dishes from his Monte Carlo and Paris restaurants. When you see the price of each dish you may have sticker shock, but let it sink in for a second, and remind yourself that you deserve to indulge in fine food every now and then. Appetizers are $20+ and entrees are $40+. The bison tenderloin I had was $52, and let me tell you, it was worth every cent!

Jessica had the pistachio encrusted striped bass with asparagus and Nicole had their version of Surf 'n Turf - halibut and seared foie gras over brussels sprouts and black truffle. Everything was succulent and savory. The fish dishes were fluffy and light, and even the vegetables were cooked to perfection. The bison tenderloin was all of our favorites. Encrusted with crushed black pepper, it had a wonderful kick, and the meat was extremely tender. If this was my last meal, I could die happy.

What made our dinner that much more remarkable was the fantastic service. There must have been at least 3 different servers that attended to our table, as well as Steve, the charismatic General Manager, throughout the evening. They went above and beyond to make our experience memorable, chatting with us and offering us individual wine pairings with our entrees, a lilikoi, rum and panna cotta foam cocktail the bartender created especially for us and the most amazing Riesling with our dessert. The meal ended with madeleines that were brought to us in the baking pan straight from the oven with Nutella. It was divine!

We took photos out on the balcony (if you can manage to get seating out there, the view is breathtaking) and even had a little photoshoot on the circular staircase surrounded by the incredible glass bubble curtain. Before leaving, we went over to Mix Lounge, which was an extension of the fab restaurant. 

Mix was truly the highlight of our entire Vegas weekend, and you should make it yours too.

Three words:  Fuck this place.  If it wasn't for the fact they carry gluten-free/dairy-free coconut milk Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, Tamari Wheat-Free Soy Sauce, Hemp Milk, Boston  Baked Beans, Brown rice in bulk, Blueberry gluten-free waffles, and a variety of bulk spices and flours, I would never shop here.  With the exception of the checkout clerks, the rest of the staff is not only completely worthless, they are, for the most part, grumpy ass holes.  ESPECIALLY the managers.

I tried doing a special order one time to purchase a case of large bottles of Tamari soy sauce.  Haha, oh what a fail.  They never called me, like they said they would when it arrived, so I finally called to inquire.  "We've got it in", the manager said, "come on down.".  Sweet.  I get in my car, drive down there and what do you know, they don't have it.  Wtf?  The guy looked everywhere and 35mins later, we agreed it was lost and I ordered another case.  Well, 2 weeks later, again, no phone call on their part, I called and they said it was in.  When I got there I asked to open the box to check my order, and what do you know, they ordered the wrong product.  They ordered the low-sodium (which needs to be cooled) instead of the regular.  Fuck it, I took it anyway.

We have had to return four (4) packages of beef that went sour before the sell-by date.  FOUR!  Each time greeted by an unapologetic, seemingly annoyed manager.  We were never offered anything in exchange for our troubles.  The third time I told the guy that not only was he going to refund my $$, he would also be comping my package of fresh beef, which he did, but after a bit of an argument.

A few days ago I was in the store and asked the manager if he had any chocolate syrup other than "Fat-free / Sugar-free" syrup (loaded with Splenda!) and he sort of chuckled and said, "No, we're a health-food store", like a pompous cock.  I said to him, "well, real sugar is certainly better for you than fake chemical sweeter" to which he again chuckled and said, "whatever, I'll make sure to let our people know" in an extremely condescending manner.  I just laughed.  First, this guy can only be described as the opposite of healthy.  Second, their store is FULL of sugar candies, IN BULK!!  Third, Splenda is hardly "healthy" for you.  Fucking idiot.

So yeah, avoid this store, if you can.  Unfortunately, it would be more of a major inconvenience for me to avoid it, so I suffer the pain.  Oh, and don't bother asking a floor guy anything, they're COMPLETELY worthless as well.

A welcome addition to the ramen scene on the east side of town.  Located in an inconspicuous strip mall at the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, this is a true neighborhood ramen joint where one is always greeted enthusiastically at the door and local Japanese residents can always be spotted as regulars.  The decor is minimalist but modern and service is prompt and non-overbearing.  

Appetizers that stand out are the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the gyoza (pork/chicken pot stickers).  The chicken is served fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior with a hint of ginger accentuated with a squeeze of fresh lemon whereas the gyoza have a nice char and the dough skin and filling are light enough to leave room for the main course.  

After consuming 15+ bowls of ramen on multiple lunch break visits from work, the key words describing the soups here are consistency and balance.  Whereas I've had a few instances at Ramen Sora and Monta where the soups were either too salty or too bitter (black garlic oil was literally blackened garlic),  the broths here all have a creamy rich depth of flavor and are not overly cloying in the mouth so the resistance to reaching for additional spoonfuls of broth once the noodles are finished is quite low.  Noodles come in thick and thin varieties with decent texture although lacking any true inherent flavor only found at the top joints.  

The standout broth for me is one of the relative newcomers on the menu: the kogashi (or burnt miso) ramen.  I've waxed poetic before on the Mallard reaction in chemistry  applied to food in a previous review(nerd alert!) but here again is yet another example of the magical powers of applying heat to rearrange amino acids and simple sugars to create a new unique flavor.  By charring miso paste, not only is there an intense aroma given off by the broth upon arriving at your table, but the flavor profile retains the savory note of the fermented soybeans we all know and love in miso but also has additional complex notes with an almost caramelized sweetness and a hint of bitterness that is pleasing on the tongue.  The crispy fried onions topping the noodles further enhance the umami tsunami.   I wish I could comment on the tan-tan men (spicy Szechuan style broth), but alas my first experience was on a full stomach from a previous meal so I must defer one to read other fellow yelper's raves on this other unique offering.

For the most part, the choices here are safe and reliably consistent, much like dating the girl next door, but if you're in the mood for something a little more adventuresome and unpredictable, the krazy kogashi ramen or the spicy and fiery tan tan men are worthy "fuku-mi-mi" one night stands (had to do it,  the name of the joint is just begging for a little humorous acknowledgment!)  

P.S.  Don't forget to partake in their generous punch-card system where one is entitled to a free order of gyoza or karaage with every fourth bowl of ramen purchased!

To all who love this restaurant, I offer an apology. 

It's been several hours now, and my ability to taste is just returning. We have been waiting four months to try this new Szechuan place, and now... well. 

The reviews were universally good, one might even say great. So we were excited that we found ourselves in Chandler and only a few miles away. 

We weren't starving, so we decided to order light. I spied the Spicy Wontons on the menu and thought they would go nice with the Hot & Sour soup. While my friend ordered the Beef Stew and Pot Stickers. 

First, bare in mind that Miu's idea of a small order of soup, is one that comes in a huge, one quart bowl! No way anyone was going to finish that.

I asked for some hot oil from our server and took some pictures. The soup was very good, though not very spicy. So I added a teaspoon dollop of the oil to my bowl. Nice!

As for the Pot Stickers, they were deep fried, not pan fried and somewhat bland. Next up was my Spicy Wontons. They looked very much like some wontons in hot oil. I tried a few and found the dish had an odd taste that I couldn't place. Saffron?  By my third wonton, I couldn't feel the inside of my mouth and everything just tasted like sand. 

The dish itself wasn't spicy, maybe a 6 on a 10 scale. But I haven't been able to taste anything for the last five hours. It was like a trip to the dentists office, everything was numb. I hope someone else might be able to identify the mystery spice or ingredient.

We may be back at some point, but it will be a long while before we do. Sorry!

I came by here last week for a one o'clock lunch and was impressed by the quality and taste of their pizza. 

We've been to Crusts a bunch of times and have never made it over to their new quick individual pizza place near the PV Mall. It's actually few doors down from where the old Atomic Comics use to be.

I find MyPie is very similar in setup to Fired Pie on Northsight. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fired-pie-scottsdale#hrid:aWt21x1Kt7IlKg41opmbug  But the taste is better at MyPie in most instances and they excel -- way over the top at customer service. Crazy nice!

I went with the Margherita ($7.49) pizza (photos) with some sweet italian sausage ($1.00).  It was very good, so I ordered a regular one without sausage for home.  That pie wasn't as special as this, but overall slightly better than the one at Fired Pie.

Recently, the WSJ had an article on how Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has quietly joined a growing group of restaurants aiming to change how we eat pizza. http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304403804579264220659257040?ref=/news-lifestyle-arts-entertainment  

My friends in SoCal tell me these are very similar to Pieology: "Pieology prides itself on providing the best tasting, healthiest kustom pizza in the world. Using only the freshest ingredients, Pieology provides smoking hot pizzas in under 5 minutes."  

Whereas, Fired Pie says: "Fired Pie, a fast, casual, rich in flavor customizable pizza and salad made from scratch using fresh ingredients just the way you like it - all at a respectful price."

No matter!  I like My Pie slightly better than Fired Pie, but both are very good.  Expect to pay $10 to $12 for a very tasty individual wood fired pizza.  So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Enjoy!

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

Maybe it's been a while since I last stepped foot into a Carrabba's or something but this place makes me, a 5'0" gal, feel like a giant.  

After being given our beeper/pager/thingie for our table [10-15min wait at 7PM on a busy Saturday night], I managed to get the top of my riding boot caught in the stupid bench twice and bump my head on the trim of the window.  Is this how you normal height people feel?  Anyways, more boot-catching-on-seats-action followed as we were seated in the tiniest booth ever.  I was sitting on one side with my gal friend, who's about the same height and weight as me, while my brother had the other side for himself.  During the whole meal, we were bumping into each other and it's hard to imagine how two people can sit on one side of a booth comfortably.  It's a surprise how I even ate when I was curled up against her the whole time!

Anyways, while I seldom review bigger chain restaurants, I really just wanted to say that Carrabba's has delicious food but I think their portions shrank... A LOT.  I had my fill of warm toasty bread with herbs and olive oil, a nice steamy bowl of sausage and lentils soup, and then had the tiniest plate of shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka.  I'm not a big eater by any means but I somehow found myself in front of an empty plate with a hungry tummy.    It tasted amazing, so much more than my brother's lobster mac and cheese and my friend's champagne shrimp and scallop linguine, but it was ridiculously small.

I know I look pretty young but seriously, it was like a kid's sized meal and considering that I was carded when I ordered my Limoncello and Prosecco drink, which tasted more like cranberry juice than anything, I'm definitely an adult.  $23/pp including tip for three entrees, one alcoholic beverage, and a lemonade.  Not sure I'd be back even though they have decent flavor.  Pity... I do love their sausage and lentil soup!

Chef Sheridan could serve me a 2x4 and I'm sure it would be the best 2x4 I've ever ate!

I had never stepped foot into the Eureka Casino, however after tonight I know I'll be going back..

I'm just going to list the items I had and my thoughts, spoiler alert...They're all good!

Pot Stickers: Hands down the best  pot stickers I've had, the filling was meaty and they were cooked to perfection.

Shrimp Toast: This dish is not something I would ordinarily order, but it came highly recommended, and did not upset.

Pork Belly BLT: Yes this is exactly what it sounds like, a BLT with Pork Belly (pork on pork...the way it should be), and sriracha mayo. I think this dish was made for me, anything that combines Bacon and Pork Belly can never be wrong!

Shortrib Grilled Cheese: This was probably the dish of the meal (I will be having of these in my future). The Shortrib is cooked to perfection, with enough cheese to balance, but not overpower. And the onion Jam served on the side complimented the sandwich perfectly.

Fried Pork Sauce Noodles: Noodles with pork belly. The noodles had a bit of spice to them, and the pork belly was cooked to perfectly. It was a touch spicy for me, but still a great dish.

Duck Rice: Hands down the best dish of the meal, A quarter duck (leg and thigh) served with rice. The duck was succulent (they told me it's a 2 day process for the duck to be made), and the garlic rice goes well with the richness of the duck. 

The Location is not too big (but way bigger than the old shop), there are a bunch of TVs, and a bar as well. I highly recommend you check it out! Well done Chef Sheridan and crew.

The Biltmore is superbly impressive from the moment you drive up and keeps your eyes dancing throughout your stay.  So much history and so much charm, this place is part Playboy Mansion, part Neverland Ranch and part Palace of Versailles.  Life size chess sets on the perfectly manicured lawn, fountains at every turn, an undeveloped mountain range as its backdrop, and poolside cabanas fit for Marilyn Monroe (she called the Biltmore her favorite pool).  Indeed, the halls are lined with photographic history of famous guests spanning the resort's opening in 1929 to present day.  (I didn't take a star off for the picture of our current prez who's a repeat guest, but I was tempted).  It makes you feel like royalty to just be there, even if you're an average Joe like me.

I give an enthusiastic A+ to the SERVICE, landscaping, feather-topped bed, and aesthetic appeal/charm of the grounds.  I was most impressed with the service.  With rooms running $600 a night, you don't want to find out that only half of the staff got the five star customer service training.  Biltmore has it down from the front desk to groundskeepers.  A special mention of the 24/7 town cars waiting to pick you up any time you're ready  to step out.

I give an A to the spa which could use a face lift, but nonetheless awarded me the best massage and facial that I've had this millennium.  Also to the in-room dining which was kinda yummy, but lickety-split, the fastest room service I ever had.

I give an A- to the room decor.  They are going for that Mission-style rustic chic, but it looked a little too Hilton and could use less of the "standardized theme" decor.  But, the rooms were very well kept and sparkling clean.  I stayed in, and highly recommend, a "resort deluxe" room and think it's worth every extra penny to wake up to coffee on your private balcony with a view of the mountains.  

If I hadn't stayed there in the middle of winter I could have played at one of their eight pools. (I'd def hang at the one with the waterslide AND the swim up bar.)  On the flip side, it was nice to have the resort virtually to myself; I had no problem getting room service in less than 1/2 an hour or a couple same-day reservations at the spa.

*psst* It's Frank Lloyd Wright "inspired."  The actual architect was a student of his, but the big guy didn't actual design the hotel.  Darn good knock-off though!

Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!

I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  

The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P

We order the 20" cheese pizza for $14.11 last night for dinner and thought it was very good.

Giant Rustic Pizza is located in the Safeway shopping area, next to after school learning center Kumon and Leslie Pool supplies.  This is a take-out only store that has seating outside.  Besides selling whole and half pies, Giant Rustic sells by the slice, along with salads and artisan breads.  The latter is mainly for the lunch crowd, but it seems to have attracted some of the parents waiting for their kids at Kumon.

The pizza is a very large twenty inch pie that is tasty.  The smaller 14" pies are called Large.  Although it is a thin crust, the bread is very chewy.  Our family of three thought is was a little too chewy, but that is a matter of taste. The dough they use seems above average, while the pizza sauce was not seasoned very much.  The light dusting of cheese on top was just enough to cover the pie.

Compared to the other pizza places within a few miles of this location, Giant Rustic's is closer to NYPD, than Ray's or Corleone's in terms of style.  NYPD tends to be chewier of the three.

We liked the pizza and all the energy and extras the new owners bring.  The prices seem in line -- somewhat less than Ray's and NYPD; but more than Corleone's for a similar sized pizzas. As I've mentioned, the 20" Giant Rustic Pizza is $12.95, while the 14" Large Rustic Pizza is $8.95. Additional toppings are $1.75 each for the Giant and $2.50 each for the Large. All prices are before AZ sales tax.

Giant Rustic also serves sandwiches that are made with their Artisan bread for $7.95.  They include Chipotle Turkey Slaw, BMT, Tuscan Veggie and Italian Bird (Turkey).

In the case next to the counter, they sell Giant Salads for $8.95, with names like Sonoran Chicken, Mediterranean, Italian Kitchen, California Dreamin and The All American. They all looked good, so I'll be back at some point for lunch.  So Three Stars, "A-OK".

I always say when it comes to Asian restaurants especially Chinese and Taiwanese - the crappier the service, the better the food. Tony T's ROTD reminded me to take this off my bookmarked places.

Xiao Long Bao:
You get 9 baos for $7. I can't help but compare XLB I've had in Shanghai and Taipei to everyone else's version. I'm very happy to say that I've found my XLB spot here in Vegas! The bao had the perfect thickness, the soup inside was hot and delicious. Glowing and glistening 5/5

Fried Tofu with Mixed Mushrooms:
Even though the tofu pieces were fried, they were soft. The mushrooms were tasty but they slide off your chopsticks. The brown sauce was good. 4/5

Beef Noodle Soup:
Our server warned me this was spicy. I appreciate it when they do that but I had a cold anyway so, bring on the heat! I could taste cumin. My nose started running - I'm not sure if it was from the spiciness or my cold...or both. The beef chunks were fatty so I had to eat around it since I'm not a fan of animal fat. I had 2 pieces of bok choy and tender noodles in my bowl. 3.5/5

Pork Loin in Red Garlic Sauce:
I didn't even know we ordered this. Shredded pork with red bell pepper strips. This reminded me of a thick and meatier version of Hot & Sour soup. 3.5/5

Steamed Shrimps in House Garlic Sauce:
Head on, butterflied but not all shrimps got de-veined. But the sauce was fantastic! Nice and garlicky. One of the better ways I've had shrimp. 4.5/5

They have street food you'll find in China like frog legs, chicken organ meat on a stick, etc.There were items we wanted to try but they no longer serve them like: enoki mushroom beef roll, pork belly with preserved vegetable(s)They need to update their menu. Even our server said it. They need to remove items they no longer serve and correct the typos. I'll definitely come back for XLB!

I still can't get over this whole Chinese Mexican whachamacallit concept. 

Granted, the story of a couple combining their cultural backgrounds is lovely, but I cannot wholeheartedly accept this combination of cuisines.

First timers are given a taste tour of couple items. Little sample cups of their meats and rice. Out of their 14 main items, they include things like: carnitas, Chinese bbq pork, egg foo young, jade red chicken (sweet&sour), jen red pork (sweet&sour), emerald chicken (ginger&onion), etc. The menu: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=BMDFYI4Hl-Vw7rsjvzbhVQ)

For those who are unaware, I am not a big fan of Chinese food. So imagine my dismay after realizing my options. And coming from the Bay Area where Chinese food is readily available and at higher standards, I did not travel all this way to have Chinese food, let alone...fusion Chinese food. But my friends were eager to try this, and so there I was.

Food can be ordered in the following options:
1) Rice bowl: Choice of a main item and steamed rice (too Chinese for me. Pass!)
2) Combo: Choice of two main items with steamed rice (even more Chinese. Pass!)
3) Quesadilla: Choice of a main item with cheese (had quesadilla already. Pass!)
4) Burrito: Choice of a main item in tortilla (my only option)

Jerk Chicken with Cuban Black Bean Burrito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=eap6hGNvq6Afm-xjso-nAA): The thought of putting sweet and sour pork or egg foo young in a burrito frightened me. So I opted for the safer choices. The jerk chicken was marinated with really hot peppers, which I did not know beforehand. And the black beans were also spicy. My mouth was on fire!!!! The burrito was $3.50. Added black beans and cheese. Plus a fountain drink, my total came to $8! The burrito was tiny! What the heck did I pay for?! Tastewise, the burrito was dry. And their choice of 'hot sauces' were a homemade black bean sauce or some sweet tangy egg roll dipping sauce. Bleh.

Each order came with a cookie (Snickerdoodle or Volcano) which was a nice touch. But how does a cookie tie into Chinese or Mexican cuisine?

One of the most confusing dining experiences ever. Oh yeah, it was another Guy Fieri DDD spot.

This Chino did not likeO.

The five of us came here last evening for dinner around 6 pm and had a nice time. Downtown Chandler is working very hard at becoming a foodie destination. 

The only drawback with our visit to DC Steak House was that they had us sitting in the very noisy bar area. So much for our two week old reservation. LOL It didn't ruin our experience, but it was hard to hear everyone at different times. 

We skipped the appetizers, since we heard their desserts were amazing. 

Two of us ordered the Salmon Filet, one had the BBQ Ribs, another the Prime Rib (special) and I had the 8 oz Filet Mignon, with two Cajun cooked Shallops (see photos).  All of us felt the food was in the good, to very good range.

Our entrees came with a dinner salad and were in the $24 to $30. My two Scallops, were seasoned just right and very tasty at $6.00 each. 

For dessert, we shared their outstanding Chocolate Layer Cake ($9.00) and the Tiramisu ($7.00), which was good and very moist. 

The damage came to $190.85 before taxes and gratuities for the five of us. It also included four beers ($18.00), three coffees ($8.85) and a Cappuccino ($5.00) for me. So expect to pay $40 each. Maybe next time we'll be allowed to sit with the grown ups in the dinning room. LOL

Met up with some fellow Yelpers at Short Leash Dog Sit Stay UYE, now earlier in the year I was introduced to Short Leash in the same manor, but it was in an alley off Central and Camelback at a food truck and they were an instant hit with me! Since then Short Leash has expanded/ added an actually restaurant, and we were there to check them out! 

I found my group pretty quick and then after I settled in my seat, and got my date situated (my 8 month old grandson)  I looked around the joint, I like it, it has a nice opened feel, maybe a little hipster, but I dig it!

I knew before I got there what I wanted, I wanted The Bear, I had a taste of it awhile back and had been craving it since then! 

Let's stop for a minute and discuss the Bear, where did they come up with this idea? Who said let's make a hot dog, and then place it on naan bread, then top it with smoked Gouda, Bacon, Bbq Sauce, Peanut Butter and some Cracker Jacks for kicks! Whose idea was this, and who 2nd it?????  I know if I came to the table with this for my kids, they would think I was smoking something! Short Leash Dogs are geniuses!  

The Bear is amazing!!! My dog was a brat, and it was smothered in bbq sauce, peanut butter, Gouda cheese, BACON and yes even the cracker jacks and blanketed in Naan bread!! This is the most amazing hot dog I have had so far!  Just mind blowing how the combinations of everything blend together. Also my bear came with a nice little green salad, eating the salad made me feel less guilty about eating the dog haha got some healthy stuff with it! 

For the little guy I ordered the corn dog bites, though he only ate 1  1/2, he dug the corn meal crust of the dog, devoured that up quickly.  He has 6 teeth and knows how to use them. He wasn't a fan of the jalapeno cheese stuffed dog, but I can safely say, that's pretty banging dog!  Might have to try it out as a Moki, yes I think that's what I'll try next!  

Another great UYE, and Short Leash, you guys have a fan in me!! I will be back!

After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. 

I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. 

April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. 

Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.

And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.

Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!

Priced at $13.50 I had the "Margherita DOC" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!

"That smoothie was so good I almost stole it from Cathy" - a very daring statement from my sister. Take my money, take my boyfriend...I'll get over it. Take my food? You want war!

After a nice morning at the gym, my sister and I finally went here after months of talking about it. I keep hearing positive comments about this place. They have vegan, gluten-free and regular options. But fear not, they have bacon if that's your thing.

Coconut Almond Blended:
I absolutely have a strong dislike of anything coconut. But with my lucky experiences of getting something I hate and ending up liking it (for the past few months) inspired me to get this. Well, I can add this to the list. It tasted like a very mild horchata. Pleasantly and surprisingly delicious! 5/5

Kale Apple Banana Smoothie:
The taste of kale reminds me of a fruit I ate when I was little, Spanish plum. So drinking kale + other fruits isn't foreign to me. This was a little sweetness to it and a nice tart flavor. 5/5

Iced Coffee:
I'm not a big coffee drinker but THIS was good. It takes them 8 hours to make. It wasn't bitter and I didn't feel the need to add anything to it. 5/5

The Hummus:
Comes with warm pita and olives on top. I ate around the olives since I'm allergic to them. Freshly made and delightful. 4/5

The Agrodolce Brussels Sprouts:
Roasted Brussels sprouts with Italian sweet and sour vinaigrette. The sprouts looked a bit overcooked but when you eat them, they still have that crunch. The vinaigrette was a bit tangy and refreshing. 5/5

The Curried Quinoa:
Quinoa, dried cranberries, almonds, parsley with sweet curry. Lots of textures and flavors. Quinoa and almonds are good non-meat protein sources minus LDL's. Cranberries are good for the ladies. 5/5

The Bizness:
Chopped kale with lemon vinaigrette. You can pick and choose 3 side items or roasted chicken / bacon / avocado to put in this salad. So, if you get a combo that sucks then, it's your fault! Accountability 101. But no worries, all the sides they have are good. 5/5

The Banana Boy Bait:
This got me singing "hey you're such a pretty boy. Hey you're such a pretty boy. You're so pretty". Banana bread with natural sweeteners. The top has a little crunch to it. They bring it to you hot. Yuuuuuummm!!! I was supposed to split this 50/50 with my sister but quickly ended up at  60/40 - she caught me before it went to 80/20. "I'm saving you from calories." 5/5

This is located inside The Center which is a LGBTQ facility. They have books and computers with internet. They have their own parking lot which is a big deal because I'm not a fan of paying for parking! I love this place!!!

I love the 51 because, many years ago, I managed to lose a police helicopter that was following and tracking me with it's spotlight, in the middle of the night. I felt like James Fucking Bond 007. First of all because I have 0 respect for law enforcement officers and their Nazi-like "just following orders" arrests of people for victimless crimes, followed by locking them in government cages. Second of all, because I knew that the statistical chances of me ever being tailed by a Police helicopter and managing to lose it, at any time again in my entire life, approached 0. Third, because I spontaneously adapted an idea from an entirely different field.

Story time! Pull up a chair.

The setting: mid-late 1990's. Perhaps around 1996, 1997, when there was massive construction going on, on the 51. I lived downtown, on Roosevelt back then. Roosevelt then was NOTHING like it is now - most foot traffic was crack heads and transvestite hookers. But whatever, I'm from NY and I felt right at home. We're a tough breed. 

I had spent the evening visiting some people who were friends at the time -  if you remember The Congo, after it turned into the first Internet coffee house ("cyber cafe") in the Valley - it was the couple that made that happen.

It was late at night. I was driving home, tired. I just wanted to get home and into bed, so I was speeding. A lot. Next thing I know, there are light flashing all over my car. I look behind me and see nothing. Roll down the window and look up, thinking I'm about to be abducted by aliens in a Betty and Barny Hill type scenario. Nope! Just the Popos! They had their spotlight on me and were ordering me to pull over on the megaphone. 

First thought: Oh shit. I'm going to jail tonight. I had probably been smoking some high grade indoor sensimillia or something similar all evening. I know, dumb to do that and drive. I'm much more responsible now, so if you want to give me a hard time for being a dumbass at the age of 23, go right ahead and I'll probably agree with you - I was a with an outsized ego because I was... a computer programmer at the time. Sounds dorky but unless you've been in that world, you have no idea of the massively exaggerated sense of self worth a kick ass software developer can have. Now that I truly am that awesome, I look back and laugh. ;)

Anyway, I digress, Back to my police problem.

Brainstorm! Amazing what the chemically altered mind can come up with. 

I've always had an interest in military tactics and strategy, even though I never joined any army. I'm a history buff, and it makes history come alive. Only I didn't learn this tactic by reading about ancient armies prepping the battle field, or reading about their troop formations, or reading one of my all time favorites, Sun Tzu. I learned it by watching the Robotech and Macross cartoons. 

I remembered a tactic called Fokker's Feint, named after a German WWI flying ace. In a nutshell - you're being chased. You gain speed but then slow down rapidly, before your opponent in the dogfight has a chance to respond. He zooms past you, you get behind, and now he's in your gunsights.

Since my car wasn't equipped with heat seeking missile launchers, lasers, or other cool accessories, just a CD player, shooting it down wasn't really an option. 

Instead, a plan came together. The best part was, I realized that if it failed, they'd have no idea of what I was trying to do, so I had nothing to lose. Go big or go home! Or in this case probably directly to jail, not passing go and not collecting $200.

At the time, the 51 was under construction Well, lucky for me, this construction involved a long stretch of the 51 that was just ahead of me having no street lights at all. Also, there was an exit coming up - if I recall correctly it was somewhere between Northern and Bethany Home.  I'm thinking Glendale, but as I mentioned, I wasn't exactly sober and this is going back a ways, so I don't recall.

Calculations going through my mind: I am going fast. (prob 90+). Helicopter going same speed. Tracked by helicopter with spotlight, which uses my headlights to tell where I am. Street lights which illuminate the freeway - off. I have one chance to do this right.

I sped up another 15 MPH so I was going past 100. Helicopter speeds up to follow, megaphone guy goes nuts, telling me to pull over. Then.... as I approach the freeway exit.... I turn off the car headlights, slam on the brakes, and pull off the exit. I watch as the helicopter zooms right past me, down the freeway. It then starts circling the freeway to figure out where I went - I watched, parked with my lights out in a parking lot right off the freeway. 

My windows were rolled down and I'm pretty sure I heard helicopter guy drop the F bomb over the megaphone. I waited for the flying pigs to leave, then took city streets the rest of the way home, careful to drive the speed limit and obey all traffic laws. 

Whew.

This is a great spot to pick up lunch. A newer location opened up closer to my home but I just feel comfy and familiar at this PB. Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The "You Pick 2" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called "My Panera" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. 

My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the "Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini"and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the "Broccoli Cheddar Soup" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!

This location is in a small strip mall with other popular places and the parking lot can be packed. Patience is key!

I had an appearance at the Chandler Performing Arts Center across the street on Saturday, January 25th.  My wife and I decided to make a road trip out of it and had intended on arriving a couple of days early to visit with family and do some sightseeing. Since I used to live in Arizona, I wanted to show her around a bit.  Our reservation was for the two bedroom Presidential Suite.  We arrived in Chandler at 7:10 pm, after driving for nearly eight hours.  We pull up to the valet station, but there is no valet in sight.  We leave our car in front and go up to the check-in desk and ask about the valet/bell hop.  The gentleman behind the counter (I didn't get his name) informs us that the valet/bell hop service ends at 7pm and that we had "just missed it"  We then proceed to at least check in to our room. The gentleman tells us that the Presidential Suite is occupied. My wife and I were both in disbelief.  He said that the current occupant is there for two nights and we were scheduled to stay four nights, so we could move rooms once it's available.  To make up for the inconvenience, we were promised all sorts of comps including "free breakfast" coupons.  My wife and I were so livid and tired we just wanted to lay down.  All we requested is for our rooms to be adjoined.  While the hotel clerk was scrambling to find us rooms, another gentleman named Brandon recognized me and offered to take our bags to our room.  Once we arrived in our rooms, we discovered that our rooms were NOT adjoining.  The next morning, we were contacted by the front desk to alert us that the Presidential Suite was available, but it only had one bedroom.  The other room would be "close by"  We decided to just stay put in our original rooms.  At least they were next to each other and fortunately, the rooms are very nice.  Leading up to the night of my performance, I wanted to get my pants pressed. I called the front desk and I was told that there is no laundry service on the weekends. So, no valet or bell service after 7 and no laundry service on the weekends.  I have never heard of this!  I thought these were just standard hotel services.  I later get a knock on my door by a hotel employee delivering our "free breakfast" coupons.  I mention the "no laundry on weekends" policy and she confirmed it, but offered to press my pants for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't get her name  but I'm certain I got this service because she also recognized me.   Regardless of that, I did appreciate that.  

My wife and I decided to check out a day early, since we'd prefer to be home together instead of in separate rooms.  When we checked out we were given our room charges bill and there were no comps or free breakfasts.  Needless to say, if we ever return to Chandler, we will not be staying at the Crowne Plaza.

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeA

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3w

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

A new Ross yay! This makes me one happy girl :)

If you have been to Ross before then you wont find too much different about this one. They still claim to offer 20% - 60% off department store prices and and by what I saw they are doing just that. The fact that some find the brand name goods here "so last season" means nothing to me as long as the quality is good, I like it, the price is right and it's cute! I love that I can get such good quality items for less. 

The bedding area is a good friend of mine. If I want new sheets or pillows I always buy them at Ross. I picked up some sheets yesterday for $29.99 that retailed for over $100! I have bought this brand before in 2 others colors and love them so I was glad to come across them again. That is one thing about Ross, you might find something you love and go back and it's gone, or you go to another location and they have a completely different selection. 

The shoes are my favorite part about Ross! I can find shoes for every occasion at such great prices here! From flip-flops to high heels they have the cutest selection. It doesn't hurt that right now is "shoe week" so they were all marked down even more.

If you are looking for a new handbag or wallet then check here before heading anywhere else. I for years have bought my handbags and wallets from Ross and I feel much better about buying the same brand name handbag here over buying it at a major department store and paying more. They have a great selection at this location and even had the newer style of the one handbags I currently use so I snatched that baby up!

You will also find a good selection of women, men, kids and baby clothes. The one thing to keep an eye out for is clothes that might be ripped or stained. I find a lot of cute clothes I pick out might have a rip or odd color on it so I pay extra attention to make sure what I am buying looks new and good quality. 

You can also shop for stuff for the kitchen, jewelry, home decor etc. They have some really adorable kitchen decor. Gift cards are available in any amount between $10 - $250 and you can purchase them at the store or customize your own on their website. I will be here a lot!

I found my newest addiction this week. Beach Hut Deli! Originally I was going to eat at the Spicy Pickle down the street but found out it was closed. I pulled up good ole yelp on my phone and started to look for something nearby. All I had to do was look at the pictures of the sandwiches to know I wanted to eat at Beach Hut Deli.  

Upon walking in I felt like I was at the beach and that was cool by me. There were surfboards decorated on the walls and even some of the tabletops were shaped like a surfboard. The menu is on the wall and I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try. I ordered a small "Santa Cruz" priced at $8.25 and it had pastrami, avocado, bacon and cream cheese. I got it with everything so it also included mayo, mustard, pickle, tomato, onion, greek peppers and cheese. This sandwich was SO good! I had to get a fork because the insides were just falling out. They didn't skimp on the sandwich at all. I will order this again without a doubt. Hubby ordered a large "Pastrami Sandwich" priced at $12.95 and it just had pastrami, cheese and mustard. He loved it! They have bottled soda or for $2 you can get a cup for the fountain machine that gives you unlimited refills for that visit. Honestly you could easily share a sandwich with someone too they look small in some of the pictures but I assure you they are chocked full. The food was delivered on a frisbee for a plate!

They have a patio area and a happy hour menu Mon-Fri. The sign inside said they currently offer happy hour all day long on Sundays. They have plenty of tv's on the walls too. They also offer catering and party trays or boxed lunches. If you haven't tried Beach Hut Deli yet and love GOOD sandwiches then stop by!

It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- 

*More Real Than The Original*

...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie  

...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)

There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd "paraphernalia".

Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:

~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal.
~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours.
~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion
~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure.
~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.

The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.  
For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor.
They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!

A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- 
no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.
I feel like I made a new friend.
Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.

The owner of Primp and Blow, Melodi Harmon, left me with such a horrible taste in my mouth, I had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, something I've never done before. Here are the problems I experienced with the services:

-When I booked my appointment for a facial, blowout and makeup application, I made it clear I needed to be done no later than 4:30 p.m. and also mentioned an Arizona Spa Girls special I was doing when I booked my appointment. The person who booked me gave no indication she wasn't aware of the special, and she told me to come in at a certain time so I'd for sure be gone by 4:30 p.m. since I had dinner reservations. The makeup artist was late, so the facialist graciously started applying my makeup for me, even though she wasn't who I was booked with.

-When I checked out, right at 4:30 p.m. when I was supposed to have been gone by, the guy at the desk ran my card incorrectly twice and supposedly refunded the purchase--the third time it was ran, it was locked out because Bank of America froze it for fraud because it was run so many times in a row. Also, the owner, Melodi, (who called another Yelp user a pig in an e-mail---not surprising) puzzledly asked me at the desk about whether I was sure about the special--something that was not only insulting to me but also showed her lack of customer service and communication with the organizations she deals with. She said she'd e-mail me a receipt and get payment later, since I was late and my card was now frozen. I was unable to use my card the rest of the night and the next morning and had to rely on my friends to pay for me. I then had to spend more than a half-hour talking to Bank of America to unfreeze it.

-After saying she'd e-mail me a receipt that weekend (and telling me in a phone message that she had e-mailed it twice more), Melodi then called me and told me I needed to call my bank again to ask about the charge. I e-mailed her a screenshot of the statement from Bank of America showing there was still a pending charge from her, which my bank said she simply needed to push through. I spent another half-hour talking to them about this, being placed on hold, being transferred, etc. I spent more time combing through more than 1,200 spam messages in my Gmail to find the supposed three receipts Melodi sent me--nothing came up, and when I called her about this, she had someone at the front desk call me to get my "correct" e-mail--she had never sent me a receipt like she said.

-I tried to explain to Melodi that the time I had spent trying to fix the problems she caused (maybe 3 hours or more) made me feel like it was unfair to pay for the services I received. I would pay for my Clarisonic facial brush I bought once I got a correct receipt. She e-mailed me two more incorrect receipts, showing her lack of conscientiousness and unawareness in general. She then threatened to call the police and press charges against me for stealing--though the whole reason why I didn't want to give her my credit card info again is obvious (I didn't want her to freeze it again), and I wanted to know the correct amount of cash to bring to the salon.

I support local businesses immensely and would never steal from one. Her unwillingness to remedy the situation demonstrates her cluelessness as a business owner. I'm disappointed because of her inept ability to deal with customers effectively.

UPDATE: Primp and Blow posted this on their Facebook page. They don't care about Yelp users.

"We just needed you to pay for the stuff you took and the services you had. It has been over a month. Did you really think you could get away with not paying? It was sad that it took me threatening to call the POLICE on you to get you to pay! Thanks for paying it was the right thing to do. :-) Who cares about yelp!I I do not. ;-)"

I came to McCormick & Schmick's after a long day at the convention center, the sign from Flamingo Rd called me in.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#iNveMHB89iN7PG4Z_Xgd9Q

Hey it was happy hour too! Monday Night Football. So like a lemming I drove off the Flamingo cliff to M&S.

I asked the waitress to seat me at the bar so I could watch the game, and I quickly struck up a conversation with a couple of Canadians who came in at the same time as me. They mentioned that they had been here the night before and had the surf n turf and it was awesome.

But wait time to get the fade going, margarita rocks no salt and some of the mussels  and an order of the garlic fries off the appetizer menu. 

Think they had to go farm the little black mussels 'cuz they took forever! Meanwhile my drink came, tasty but hardly any booze and loaded with ice. Finally my teasers showed up. I order another Marg,  but this time I tell her easy on the ice heavy on the tequila. 

TEASERS:
Black Mussels ... Tasty li'l critters in a herb wine bath, but 1/3 of them were missing the prize in the middle.  2.5***Stars
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#h6Hl9nkaR5zNYQb1HK2OPw
McCormick's Cheese Burger French Fries ...  what a ripoff! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#0X6qy_5w7XYOVFgwRUOw8g
I got a stand of lightly seasoned shoe string fries.  I asked for some Tapitio NOPE!  But they did have some Siriacha to give 'em some life.  2**star fries

I ordered my entree and a spinach salad and another marg. 2nd marg was better but told her to double the tequila , 1/2 the ice this time. 

SALAD:
Wild Mushroom Spinach Saute ... this was the best thing I had here. The shrooms and spinach were cooked with a sesame oil and were great. 4**** Stars
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#393BnxQiULXRzo4mTFPziA

ENTREE:
Steak & Lobster ...  Damn Canadians led me astray on this one.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#sGVLVPfjmKeSGTIr_KuQIg
The steak looked good but was chewy and lacked any beef flavor. The Lob tail was overcooked and rubbery but had a little smack off the grill and dredged in butter was palatable.

The staff was friendly, the place had a nice interior and a sweet bar. The service was hit and miss. 3***Stars

M&S was a bust for me, an overpriced meal lacking flavor.

I will not return here as there are too many other great places to eat within walking distance.

How does one start their Centennial revue? Which venue does one choose to mark the occasion? How many other factors can possible come together to make this the hardest revue of my Yelp career?

...and will I ever be able to regain my sanity?

I am told that a great work of art is never truly finished, that the work never ends. After just one visit to Soho Japanese Restaurant, I now understand what that means.

Clearly the great Yelpers of Las Vegas have collectively cried out the praises of this understated little gem in the southwest valley. Not only does it rank top among sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it ranks tops among ALL restaurants in Las Vegas. That little tidbit has to be making some of this town's "legendary" chefs red in the face. Someone should tell those people at Michelin they are dinosaurs - no wait, never-mind, let them figure it out.

You see when it comes down to it, it's quite simple - if you do something great, people will notice. And it's clear, Soho does great better than anyone in Vegas.

The first thing you notice when you walk into Soho is that no world renowned restaurant decor consultancy group was brought in to "class the place up", like they do in most 5 star restaurants. Soho is a simple, friendly, comfortable and welcoming environment - a 5 star restaurant that won't make you feel like you're not good enough to be there (what a concept.)

The staff are regular people, just like you and me. But management is obviously treating these people with a little respect because it's quite clear they all love working there - it shows in absolutely everything they do. Imagine great service at a 5 star restaurant from friendly people who don't look down their nose at you (are you guys starting to see a trend here?)

But you really don't appreciate how good you have it until the food arrives. It's easy to get so comfortable here that you can forget you are about to partake in one amazing meal. All that changes once you take the first bite. For us it was the Uni Trio - just Wow! (Thank you sir, may I please have another.)

I know what you're thinking, what does a boy who grew up in Fargo, North Dakota know about sushi? Wouldn't he be dead last on the list of people you should trust on the subject? (Hey Buddy, you forgot to cook this!) 

Fair enough.

The truth is, you're just going to have to decide for yourself. No amount of banter from me is going to change your mind,so I'll leave that up to the marvelous people at Soho, they are better suited to the task. 

Whew! One hundred down, and ready for round two. Go Yelp!

Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. 

We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!

While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. 

We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!

Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! 

And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. 

OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!

Sprinkles is at The Linq (between the Flamingo and the Quad). Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. 

I just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a "Doggie Cupcake" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a "Lemon Meringue" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. 

There is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. 

Hours:
Sunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am

I'm agitated by the time I sit down with my food. 

So many different eateries I go to, I understand the delivery system. Self-serve, buffet, seat yourself, order/pay at counter then take that thingamajig number to your table, and of course my favorite, full wait help service! But at Taco y Taco, I look at the menu board, see the different ordering stations, the cashier to the side, and I don't understand! I do understand, I just don't see how it's a good system. 

So if I wanted an Al Pastor taco, I stand and wait in that line, then if I want a quesadilla for my son, I wait in this other line, order, and wait for that.  Which line is to order the corn? Each station has a couple of guys back in that general area, but you don't know who takes what order, you just wait till someone asks you or make eye contact with one. So finally, I pile all my food onto a tray and make it to the cashier line, wait, pay, then wait at the salsa bar line. Yes, I'm serious. Hallelujah, I finally get to sit, only to realize I forgot my napkins. Where's the napkins line?

I've tried this location twice. I won't review the food, because I don't think I've tasted enough of these tacos elsewhere to know how good they are comparatively. Food was ok, I don't crave any to go back in a hurry. Plus, I've heard about their recent health demerits. 

I appreciate  the music and the vibe, and that they offer vegetarian options. I liked sitting upstairs and prices are reasonable. Will I be back? Probably not. I'm not on the Taco y Taco bandwagon, but I'm ok with that.  I'll go look for a taco shop where there's only one line.

I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a "cleaning" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.

Some of my friends laughed and others scoffed at the fact that I had booked accommodations at the Hooters Casino Hotel for my Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon weekend in Las Vegas.

It wasn't as bad as everybody told me it would be, and considering I booked many months in advance and found Expedia rates ranging from $45 to $55 a night for a room in the Tower building I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  For the race the "off the Strip" location was perfect as it was a comfortable fifteen minute walk to the start / finish area on race day.

My room was okay since I only spent time there to sleep and to yelp.  With the exception of parts of the carpet the room was fairly clean too.  I wore white socks in the room and each night my white socks turned either light gray or charcoal colored depending on how much walking I did in the room.

Here were some of the cool things about my room:

*The queen size bed was firm and comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=iHWbOO5Jzfh31dVthmiB6Q).
*Standard sized television (no flat screen) had crisp cable broadcasting.
*Comfortable desk had a brand new issue of the latest Hooters magazine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=96qyqd-PoYisLKTjPUswuA).
*There is a digital room safe just in case you decide to go out for a 13 or 26 mile run (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=BZMBwl3J5Y6vylsT0c-hBA).
*Clean bathroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=dPRiakqkf2jm4_1Tyw-Iww).
*Basic amenities (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=yqsvK9WYxf_OtSIjZUBXIA).
*Free bottled water (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=S4pY5Ebf2pSWPyP59WTvmQ).  Runners love water!!
*Two fake palms in the room look great without the flying insects (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=YBp_3-oEiKi-ayVqcVDe_w).
*Amusing privacy door signs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=toTBsd8WeZhsSMAEALOiOQ).

Of course there's always bad things that makes it a 3 star review:

*The comforter was lumpy.
*No free internet.  No problem as I brought a wireless card this time.
*The deadbolt kept slamming into the door jamb.  I had to whip out my Leatherman and do a repair job for them.  The deadbolt works perfectly now.  You're welcome!!
*Noisy pipes and the water pressure in the water closet was horrible.
*Toilet tissue holder was too short and the spool would come loose and fall on the floor every time the tissue was in use.
*Thin walls.  I heard every foul-mouthed conversation my neighbors had, but I heard every intimate one too!
*Horrible, lazy housekeeping staff!  I did a better job cleaning up after myself!
*Incompetent and slow check-in process.  The lady kept mispronouncing my last name.  How do you fuck up my last name?  It's three letters and the second and third letters are the same vowel.  Dummy!

I didn't take advantage of the slot playing amenity that came with the room.  The casino downstairs is very small.  Like I said, if I could find these rates again I would return.  If not, don't bother!

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

Coco Donuts is locally owned and opened recently. After seeing the pictures on yelp, I just had to try one of their cronuts! Walking in there was a nice sweet smell in the air and the inside was clean and colorful. I saw there were cronuts left and asked the woman behind the counter to go over the flavors with me, which she did and explained the prices. Hubby and I chose to get a 1/2 dozen donuts and a cronut to try.

I chose the "Raspberry Cronut" priced at $3 and wasn't crazy about it. The icing was just too overly sweet and the raspberry filling reminded me of Welch's jelly. I could only eat a couple of bites because it was just too sweet. The cronut was also tough and not flaky like I'd imagined. If this is what Dominique Ansel's taste like, I'm not missing out. Next time I will try one without icing and see how it is.

-Raspberry Filled.... Same Welch's style jelly and the glaze was just too sweet. 

-Apple Filled... This one was good. There was a good amount of tasty apples in the center and the donut was very soft.

-Sugar Twist... Very soft and good, but nothing spectacular. 

-Cinnamon Roll... Soft, a bit too sweet and again, nothing spectacular.

-Chocolate Long John... This was very soft and delicious. It was also a decent size. 

-Chocolate Iced Bavarian Cream... The bavarian cream had no flavor, but the rest of the donut was good.

The donuts here are very, very soft. They are also a good size for the price, but this is just an average donut shop to me. Nothing really stood out and even though I love sweets, too many of the donuts here were just too sweet for me. The woman behind the counter was nice enough to give is 4 donut holes to try and again, they were melt in your mouth soft, but the glazed were just too sweet while the cinnamon sugar believe it or not was perfect. They have a punch card so if you are here buying donuts by the dozen the card will benefit you. The regular donuts are currently 95 cents each and the coffee prices $1.75 - $2.50 so I plan on stopping back by and trying out the coffee with a different cronut or donut to see what it's like.

Half Dozen $5.50 - $5.75
One Dozen $9.50 - $9.95

Specialty and Fancy donuts range from $1 - $3.50 each.

Monday - Friday: 5 am - 6:30 pm or sell out 
Saturday - Sunday: 5 am - 3 pm or sell out

I used to make jokes about how I'd someday like to open a yoga studio called Extreme Yoga (everything had its turn being marketed to us as "Extreme" for a while there in the early 90s didn't it?)
There would be intense, muscle-building poses (this was before i'd heard of the genius of joe pilates), a drill-instructor-like leader barking orders for the next pose "I SAID RELAAAAX, MAGGOTS!!!, and criticizing you for being a weak little mealy-mouthed wuss if you couldn't get or keep your balance, etc.
Good times.

Well, someone practically stole my idea and opened Bikram Yoga studios all over the place!  Just kidding, but not really.

The process of signing in as a first timer was so painlessly simply I thought sure I was skipping something, but nope.  Even as a Groupon customer, there was only a slight upsell mention of how purchasing an additional block of time during the first week would mean a better price than getting it afterwards.  

The price of 'renting' a towel must be designed to be purposely prohibitive so that they can avoid too much volume with their commercial towel cleaning service, because I don't think $2 is a very fair price at all for what you're getting (NOT getting, just borrowing), and they'd much rather have everyone bring their own towel.  Nice that it's available though.

The facility is clean and seems spacious from the lobby, but the limited square footage of the studio room itself filled up very quickly with bodies.
A shower/restroom/not-lockers-but-cubby-holes room is decent, and apparently kept stocked with soap/shampoo by volunteer donations.

Two instructors on different days gave a similar, but varied class.  Each having a slightly different style, both being competent and thorough in their directions -- I just felt that I could do without hearing about chakras and such related subject matter (i know it's part of the territory, but i think the lack of focus on the spiritual side is why i like joe pilates so much)

The class itself it pretty butt-kicking.  The advice to sit, but at least stay in the room, is good for when you feel the need to rest.  A newbie surely will need to sit for some of the standing balancing poses.  
I did, but in only two classes, I showed a marked improvement in that i only sat down twice the second class -- meaning a 3x improvement over the virgin visit!  

MORE NEWBIE ADVICE:
~drink a lot of water beforehand, and do not eat too much greasy food - you will sweat it out and it will give an odor like french fries, believe me.

which brings us to:
~take a shower IMMEDIATELY prior to class, or as close as possible, because you will sweat about 2.3 buckets, and as the wonderful instructor mentioned, the skin is an organ of elimination and this sweating is about releasing toxins, and toxins are stinky

~sniff your towel first, if you rent one - some of them, although clean, still have a lingering french fry odor permeating the cotton ( i wasn't the only one oozing grease, i guess)

~prepare to be sore.  this is a real workout, not some tai chi, ol' lady smooth flow stretch yoga crap.  put effort into a program like this and you won't need weight training.

I absolutely got a lot out of just these two visits, and plan to detox more during the next 3 weeks.
Considering the price of this place (outside of the groupon), I don't think the excessive charges for the towels or the BYOsoap is very appropriate.   That would have to be figured in when I decide if I want to continue with the membership after the initial period expires.

For now, I'll just keep stinking up my corner of the studio with french fry and chinese food sweat (beer, too!), and hope it doesn't disturb the folks on the neighboring mats all that much by harshing their mellow with fantasies of grease and carbs. 
8^ )
I love being healthy.

*** Mmm-mmmm .... 
      That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?
      Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef.
      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.

Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.

Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.

Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.

 *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers? 
       Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.

Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.

*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?
      Ah, hit the spot.

Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Crme Brle, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.

Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.

I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.

This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a "Sour Cream and Onion" and "Jalapeno" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.

Dear owners of Commonwealth, 

You built an amazing bar and a beautiful space.   Good beer and drink selection too.  It really could be called the crown jewel of the "new downtown".  Too bad you ruined it by running it like a douchey club that interferes with a patron's ability to relax and charges ridiculous prices.

The space you built is exceptional -- quirky design mixing elements of a lounge and upscale European chateau with laidback couches, chandeliers, a rooftop patio with an open air bar.  The drink selection is excellent -- great selection of beers and some nice creative cocktails.  After 5 minutes in your business, I thought it was a solid 5 star rating all the way.  

But why . . . why are you running this place like a douche magnet?  Why the hell would you build a lounge-like pub and then refuse to let people sit on the weekends without paying for "bottle service"?  Seriously.  Why the hell would locals ever frequent a place where they can't sit down without paying 1000% mark up on a bottle of liquor?  And putting a velvet rope outside with a bouncer to control access to your bar?  What the hell?  And no happy hour?  And no prices on the beer menu?  That's not classy.  It's just annoying.  I guess I understand wanting to hide your prices given that you're charging the tourist/rip off rate for drinks.   

I've visited your bar twice and I can officially say I'm done.  I won't be coming back and won't be bringing visitors.  You're absolutely a one-and-done type of bar.  Most everyone I know who's visited, has not gone back.  Too expensive, too douchey, too uninterested in wanting people to come back.

A piece of advice: in 6 months to a year when you're not the hip new kid on the block anymore and start to notice that your bar is pretty much empty until 9 pm (like Insert Coins), start making changes to encourage locals to be repeat customers: 1) Get a happy hour, 2) lose the stupid velvet rope, 3) let people sit down without buying $100+ of liquor.  Treat your customers like you want them there and don't just want to bilk them out of their money.  Start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and you'll bring the locals in.  Don't and you'll be closed by the end of 3-5 years.

My friend and I came here during Memorial Day Weekend. We came during the transition between brunch to dinner time (but we paid dinner prices) so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything. 

I remember thinking it was a very decent price for a Vegas Buffet... but then I was not too impressed when it came down to the food. 

I just gathered a bit of everything to take *a bite* and the only thing that I really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese, shrimp cocktail & crab legs!! After the experimental plates, I just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my money's worth!! 

I also wanted to try the prime rib, but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a medium/medium-rare cut. I saw all of the meats and it DID look too over cooked so I passed on the prime rib. What a disappointment... 

I was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection... I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate: macaroons, eclairs, tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry... but it was all so mediocre... Most items only got one bite from me. I took a double taste on the flan, but I was still not impressed. The only dessert I finished was this Cappuccino shooter (minus the whipped cream on top).

What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.

I attempted when they were in Henderson, but was a day late and a cup of shave ice short. They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! 

Sizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)

Step 1 - Choose your flavor and size
Step 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each
Step 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) 

I ordered the "Ex-Straw-Binary" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!

The employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!

One often hears a rendition of the famous adage to enjoy the journey rather than to rush through it, and this is one prime example of such great advice.
We were intrigued by the 1000 plus reviews for Bouchon, so our aim was to dine at this establishment for brunch.  However, i couldn't muster any more energy to walk that extra 10 minutes through the windy Venetian Hotel, so we ended up at Postrio instead.  MUST.EAT. NOW.  lol.  this was an amazing gem with prime real estate seating.  

LUNCH FARE: 

RICOTTA GNOCCHI with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese ($25)
a soft ballad of flavors dance together with each bite.  so soft with potatoes oozing out.  each bite was outstanding and just the perfect portion.

TRIO OF HOUSE MADE SAUSAGES ($16)
Housemade Mustard, Pickled Vegetables, Grilled Country Bread, Baby Mache.  
yes, appetizer portion, but i knew i had to save room for dessert.  my ideal type of meal is usually 60% protein, 30% veggies, and 10% carbs, and this dish delivers exactly that.  executed so well, each bite was heavenly.  the sausage on the far right had pistachios, so pistachio lovers -- make note.  the fuchsia looking vegetable adjacent to the pistachio sausage is actually pickled watermelon.   it's not the typical watermelon that one would purchase at the local market.  this type of melon had the tight texture & consistency of a daikon or a radish, yet it was a watermelon.  

CHOCOLATE MELTING BEIGNETS were fabulous! ($12)
the chocolate beignets were oozing with warm chocolate filling and dusted with powdered sugar.  one proper spoonful of ice cream  was the perfect complement to the warm beignet.  the vanilla dipping sauce was just an icing to the dish -- it was great, but not necessary, but definitely did not hurt it at all.  for a dessert, everything was "not too sweet" either, which is always perfect in my books. 

for Mimi L,  they carry Banoffee, which is a banana & toffee cream pie ($9).  Other delectable treats include chocolate cream pie ($9), warm apple pie ($9), lemon cheesecake ($10), chocolate souffle ($12), and housemade ice cream or sorbet ($8)

****

SERVICE was impeccable.  Our server, Luigi, was nothing short of accommodating and awesome.  the pseudo "outdoor" seating gave us a great glimpse of St Mark's Square, where performers entertain passerbys.  the festive atmosphere and costume of the performers really enhances the "Venetian" feel.

lastly, love how the manager emails me personally to welcome me back to the restaurant.  i had received a similar email from Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at MGM Grand.  great personal touch.  definitely worthy of 5 stars =)  Mr. Puck, i'm starting to become a fan of yours.

One, two, three strikes, you're out!

Let's just talk about last night's dinner:  I really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't working out.  Maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in [Johnny Rockets at Westgate also has this issue] or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold December evening... I like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the "orange sauce"  and unagi sauce on EVERYTHING.  

It wasn't just a few artsy swirls of the "orange sauce" and unagi sauce.  They absolutely drench it.  You can dive in with scuba gear!  Maybe I didn't notice that I wasn't ordering a wide array of items but I swear almost everything I saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.  Eating the Firecracker Jalapeos, The Mexican Roll, and The Kamikaze Roll felt and tasted the same to me.  The only real difference between the two rolls was that The Mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon [yes, cooked] and imitation crab while The Kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.  Other than that, it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.  Thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.

The tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamame on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.  Like I said, maybe they do have more variety and we didn't see any but I don't think I'll be back to test this theory.  Portions are pretty generous and you can at least ask for easy sauce but it's your poison if you choose to dine here.  Too many great places to eat to just settle for sauce-drenched-everything.  Service here could also be a little better considering when we went, we were just one of three tables.

$27 each [for 2 ppl] including tip for edamame, firecracker jalapeos, two rolls, three tacos, and an iced tea.

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

Some might call me a super-fan, but when Upward Projects does something, you can't help but love it. In the game of artisan pizza, Federal kneads out the competition. 

Having tried most pizzas from their menu, I've landed on the Manifesto as my normal order. I love the Manifesto, with exception of the mushrooms, so when I order it, I always sub for brussels sprouts instead, sometimes I'm feeling a little frisky and have them throw sweet potato on there too. Not only are they happy to make these changes for me, but the server usually says something like "That sounds delicious, I need to try it!"

The manifesto, with goat cheese, red sauce, fennel, schriener's sausage, and brussels sprouts is delish. The toppings are always super fresh, the crust is a bit crispier than most other artisan pizza's from around town and the service is always excellent.

$12 - $15 will buy you a pizza sized well enough for one hungry dude or in my case, large enough for two to share. Joining their email posse will usually score you a free pizza once or twice a year for things like your birthday or promotions they feel like running.

Their vegetable side is neither here nor there in my opinion, likely because I don't love carrots, but the broccolini were delish. 

If you're a dessert fan (remember two deSSerts and one deSert, in case you can never remember how to spell dessert or desert for that matter) they generally always have a fruit cobbler of some sort. If it's mixed berry, you must order it, dessert fans everywhere insist. Oddly enough, I don't order dessert at many places, mostly because I'm generally looking out for my figure, but in this case, I wouldn't be eating pizza either, but when I am, I sometimes order dessert. Go all out right? ;-)

Enough rambling and back to the part we're all waiting for... the end of this review.

Always delish, always fresh, and no one has ever actually gotten fresh with me while dining here, not yet at least. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Michelin Star #40

Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good. 

It's really not fair to Le Cirque that this was our dinner the night after a magical time at Guy Savoy (GS), but that's how the cookie crumbled. 

The gaudy interior took me back to Jol Robuchon and made me long for the clean and modern space of GS:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#Pz6MCvMoqe20cjiEN61ICA

We elected the full Degustation Menu and each got different things to maximize the number of dished to try. At $135pp plus $88 to share a wine pairing, Le Cirque really sticks it to you, which I'm fine with if the food is great. 

In short, we were not impressed by much and some of the food was just bad. The service was stuffy, borderline arrogant at times, and without stealth. Pretty much the opposite of GS. 

It wasn't all bad though, the poached egg with caviar ($15 extra) was very nice. The veggies were cooked right and the paprika crostini was a delight;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#HSFKfMYBwPd6Ti0H4rkfjA

The uni and yuzu gelee panna cotta was also a very nice and refreshing treat. But uni and caviar on anything is great;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#7dEMzWlg6QWbfEmIdcXxCw

Sadly, the foie was overcooked and tasted like iron;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#oowkr4-kGh57Y4nr4ZGF2w

The langoustine was bland, but I did love the plate it came on;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#ut_8e57Qx0CenHudGsRTJQ

The john dory was inexcusably bland and devoid of flavor. I couldn't believe how sub-par this dish was;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#dVF_SYM3fhMsoCVWu4o9gA

The potato wrapped bass was another let down, just lacking any seasoning and of course a place like this doesn't have salt and pepper on the table;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#YRbileTLomHKFQSDkN4F_A

The $65 supplement for the A4 wagyu was a complete waste. The meat had little marbeling left and was pretty chewy throughout. This was nothing like the beef you'd get in Japan;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#9zwWrrYAV2cQ0ZMv7HHA2Q

The duck was the worst offender of the night, with un-rendered fat, chewy skin, and meat so raw it couldn't be cut with their dull knives, we ate two pieces and left the rest;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#nL9yA-rNByjeeK6Z64c7Hg

Dessert however was great, the souffl was amazing;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#YnVOCWLwVeNzAsTT_p71KQ

And the sugar sphere thingy was beautiful and contained a delicious center;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#uTC99JJzT08_T21tppclug

Overall it was a big letdown and not worth the effort to give a more detailed breakdown of each dish.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, "the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices."   

This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.

MENU:
Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:
Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50

SERVICE:
As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.

FOOD:
Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.

We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  

On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.

As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  

PRICES:
Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.

I've had 14 reviews deleted by the legal department this year. And, I really wanna write a nice review for Tea Time Cafe that will still be around this time next year. So, I've decided to drop my tired and worn out "Schtick" in order to avoid violating any more TOS. Therefore, I have devised an ingenious idea to use everyone else's schticks, since they don't seem to have as many reviews deleted. 

So here it goes: 

THE SKINNY Tea Time Cafe is a real jewel of the Northwest. THE SKINNY, they have honey toast with green tea ice cream. THE SKINNY I loved it more than I love Canada.  THE SKINNY, with honey toast in the NW, I don't have to drive to Ichiza or Shuseki anymore! THE SKINNY, the guy who manages this place was really nice to me and didn't mind that I waited on the couch for 10 minutes for my friends to show up. THE SKINNY, they got a cool claw machine that has rilakkuma and domos.  THE SKINNY I don't LIKE Tea Time Cafe. I LOVE it. THE SKINNY If I don't love it, I don't swallow. 

I LOVE BIG WEINERS! But they didn't have weiners here, MORONS! So perhaps my morals helped me get the curry fries. They are perhaps like chili cheese fries but with curry instead of chili. The fries weren't immoral and perhaps were cooked extra crispy. It did not hella suck. Perhaps, it was the opposite of sucking. Speaking about sucking, I sucked them down like a hoover! The workers were not IDIOTS or CREEPY immorals! They were actually really nice, SCORE! Perhaps, I love the fries more than I love big weiners. And the prices be so low dat I be ballin on a budget! YAY!

GABAZINGA! I'm so fun! I showed up to Tea Time Cafe alone, but I always have fun when I'm around! While waiting for my friend to show up, I broke out my photography skills and took several pictures of the food I ordered. But, I accidentally deleted all the photos before uploading them onto yelp. Jeez could I be more ridiculous? I sometimes wish I could be! Wizzle Wozzle! The curry fries were perfectly browned and the curry itself was made from a real gram masala rather than a powder mix. It wasn't JCZ, but I was satisfied and not too uncomfortably full. I wasn't trippin... and after taking a selfie with that same goofball face I always make, Amanda and I ended up break dancing on out of there. 

(T)hank u BIG MAHALO Amanda-monstah for always recommending such great restaurants! SHAKA!  
(E)very Japanese item from ramen to unagi don is on the menu-monstah. ATTACK!!!
(A)pple Yogurt Smoothie had me slurping like a smoothie-killah!! ATTACK!! 

(T)una rice balls with unagi sauce is on FIYAH! Bomb!
(I)'m running out of creative words to use for this schtick
(M)e has a gud tee drunk...
(E)pithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma..Sorry I couldn't think of another word that started with E. 
Wakki Lakki Aloha!
(yelp challenge 100 out of 2343)

after dropping off donations at the next yelp help event and bragging about it all over talk, i'm gonna make sure that tea time cafe becomes my regular spot to hang out with my friends who are so much more popular than you. i can see myself jumping into my vessel of transportation which carries the shape of my soul to tea time cafe every morning for coffee and a boba.  i don't go to bad restaurants, and i can see a bad restaurant from miles away because i have super powers..i can see through bullshit. and tea time cafe is ranked #1 by centennial hills yelp. i'm not spreading rumors again, ttc is more legit than yonaka. i can't believe i just said that, well i guess i'm at that age where my brain just says things just to see what happens. 

99.9% of the time it's those darn BANDWAGON faux Japanese WANNABES who run 99.9% of these places. My ability to sense bandwagon wannabe Japanese restaurants is 99.9% more acute than the reflexes of the kitty cat on my profile picture. I'm 99.9% sure Tea Time Cafe is 99.9% not a bandwagon wannabe.  I love Tea Time Cafe more than 99.9% of yelpers. I've eaten here 99.9% more than all of you. They got good miso ramen here, and as you know I got 99.9% more ramen experience than you. They also have Tonkatsu here, not Tonkotsu!! GET IT RIGHT!!! GOD DAMN IT! Why is it that 99.9% of you non-Japanese get tonkAtsu confused with tonkOtsu! That makes me feel 99.9% like blowing my brains out at Kabuto where I'm 99.9% sure they are not bandwagon wannabes. 

BTW Amanda, keep your meaningless crown! 

Legal disclaimer- RELAX!!! Please learn how to take a joke. I'm a big fan of all your reviews and schticks. This was not a diss, it was an informative parody.  At least this review was more informative than those yelp tips that only say "yummy" or "the duke is here!"

This may be the only time I ever give a 5 star review and never return back b/c I definitely feel like a creeper in the Teazer.

A few friends wanted to check out the cafe after indulging in a massive food coma across the street.  As we walked in I'm not gonna lie - i was nervous - it felt like going to my first nudie club when I was prepping for SATs.  

Don't come off like an OCG-IT....Don' come off like an OCG-IT .that's Old Creepy Guy....In training.   I like to think i have another 5-10 years before the IT is removed.  

We were greeted by Courtney who was really sweet.  She sat down with us and told us all about the menu.  I really cant remember much about the boba drink I had but for 5 bucks it was great!   We played 6-7 games of Uno with Courtney's house rules and then played a version of Big 2 or VC.

I definitely then pulled the creeper move but i SWEAR it was on accident......she asked our names and it went around the table and for some reason Charlie came out of my mouth.   If you don't know me, Charlie is no where close to what my name is.  Nowhere in the ballpark......At this time my friends were telling a story so i didnt want to butt in and after a few minutes i wasnt gonna say -- oh heyyyyy..... by the way.... my name isn't Charlie....so i ultimately passed the point of no return.  No notes needed - creepy move executed......check

Eventually later, my name came up and did the explaining.  Anyhow time flew by - things felt more natural - the girls are sweet and easy to talk to.  Take care of these girls and tip well.  They go above and beyond exemplary service of any food server.  

I'm not sure if i'll be back after pulling an OCG.   Side note - As I was walking out I saw 2 master Yelpers probably the Co-Dukes not counting the owner... decked out in suits - that was pretty pimp.

**MAIL ORDER REVIEW**
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=blLLKuO1g4MrD4tQCgzh0g

Craig R. wrote a review for Popped when he visited their shop in Las Vegas.  He said it was awesome and worth trying.  He peaked my interest with the fact they have dill pickle flavored popcorn.  This I had to try so I went online to their website and ordered a nice variety.  Prices are cheap until you add fedex shipping charge to it.  

Their popcorn tastes extremely fresh, has a nice texture, zero unpopped kernels, and there's hardly any remnants of the popcorn hulls.  All the ingredients used tasted very high quality.  Popcornopolis should find out what type of corn they use and change because they have way too many hulls in their popcorn.  

I've ranked flavors below from most to least favorite.

505: Caramel corn with white chocolate, fresh green hatch chilies, and powdered red hatch chilies.  Holy mother of God is this amazing.  Craig says it's the "best damn popcorn I've ever had" and I have to agree.  Hatch chilies are my favorite chili and unlike other products I've had the hatch is the main star of the show.  It stands out front and center slapping you in the face and sending you to New Mexico for it's chili goodness. It's spicy enough to cause you to cough and choke while eating it and the sweetness of the caramel and chocolate turn the choking into groaning while you slam more into your word hole.

Dilly Pickle:  Best pickle tasting snack item I've had.  It's sweet popcorn with a super sour, vinegar biting, fresh dill flavor to it.  Tastes just like a sour dill pickle.  Loved it!

Smore's:  Caramel corn with mini marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate.  My wife and I really liked this combo of flavors but I wish they'd mix it a bit better.  Most of the graham crackers were at the bottom of the bag and there wasn't enough marshmallow... but....  the overall taste was fantastic.

Get Toasted: Tastes like cinnamon and sugar.  If you like these two ingredients then this flavor is for you.  Yum!

Bling Bling Cookies & Cream: Caramel corn rolled in crushed Oreo cookies and dusted with metallic edible sparkly glittery things(bling bling).  As soon as you open the bag you get the aroma of Oreo cookies.  It tasted just like it's namesake sans the cream.  I really didn't' taste the cream part, but....  still a great popcorn if you're a fan of oreo cookies.

Chicago:  It's a mix of caramel, white cheddar, and nacho.  It's sweet, salty, and cheesy.  It works.

Salt & Vinegar:  Kettle corn tasting popcorn tossed with vinegar.  Oddly enough it works unlike the buffalo wing flavor below.  Not as acidic as the dill pickle flavor, more mellowed out.  Not my favorite Salt & Vinegar snack but tasty none the less.

Buffalo Hot:  This flavor was disappointing.  It had a nice kick of heat but barely any wing flavor.  I wish it had the flavor intensity of their dill pickle one.  Needs more buffalo wing taste.  Also the base flavor of the popcorn is kettle corn which doesn't really work with buffalo wing.

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

Secret 1 - Yes, I was trying to look you in the eyes, but I'm a man and my eyes tend to stray.
Secret 2 - I'm a bit shy.  So buy me alcohol and I'll open up a bit.
Secret 3 - If you are female and I left you a compliment, it's likely I think you are cute.  Not so for men.

No more secrets!!  I've given too much away--unless you go the Secret 2 route.

Service - 5 Stars
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - Approximately $26.00 (The soon to be brother-in-law paid).
Seafood - ??
Meats - Yes
Vegetables - Yes
Dessert - Yes, Cannoli & New York Cheesecake.
Fruits - N/A
Other - (1) Located on Level 3 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) You will find it between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (4) Papst Blue Ribbon Beer is on tap here.  (5) Avoid the times 1 am to 5 am because that is the busiest times--that is when all The Situations and J Wowws come out from Marquee.  

What was Ordered:

Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fianc chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:

*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, "greasy."  

*Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.

*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  

The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.

Pellini is a solid Four Stars.

After reading Ryan J's post on Yelp's "Near You" section online, I walked across the street to have a late lunch.  I arrived around 2:30 and there was less than a dozen or so diners, both inside and out. Apparently at lunch time, they had a line two deep outside. This was after being open to the public for three and half weeks.  A good gauge as any for a new restaurant.

Like Ryan, my first impressions are pretty positive.  The concept if you will, is an Italian version of Chipotle.  I'm not sure if the owners would agree, but here are your big three choices.

First, you could start with a Pellini.  What they say is a classic Italian Piadina.  A sort of Italian flat bread (think tortilla) that you can stuff with meat, veggies, cheese and dressing.

Or, you could have a Pasta Bowl with an angel hair base, then the grilled meats, veggies and cheese.

Lastly, you could have a Salad Bowl, again with all of the above added on.  Got it?

The meats range from two types of chicken (breaded chicken breast or grilled), steak florentine with olive oil and garlic, italian sausage, scrimp scampi, salmon with rosemary and lemon zest, or you could just go Vegan.  

The prices range from $6.55, up to $7.95 for the two fish entrees.  At this point, you can add from nearly two dozen ingredients, like artichoke hearts, pancetta, grilled eggplant, arugula, et cetera.

I had the Pellini with grilled chicken with spicy marinara (Arrabiata) and various veggies.  It was very good (photo) and filling.  

I had a chance to meet two of the managers and they were very excited on how they have been received with very little marketing.  I understand this is their first restaurant in the concept and are looking at other locations in the valley.

Pellini offers free WiFi and they have an Italian radio station playing music in the background for ambience. 

Enjoy!

***Jean Philippe Patisserie offers expensive and fancy individual cakes; while I did not love mine, I could see that some of the cakes here might be really good***

Located in Aria, Jean Philippe Patisserie is a gourmet patisserie and gelato bar that is located right next to the casino floor.  The desserts here are very enticing.  The gelato bar looks pretty run-of-the-mill, but Jean Philippe Patisserie has a huge glass display counter that shows off nice looking chocolates and individual, arty cakes (that remind me of the individual cakes at Jin Patisserie in Venice).

I went through the cakes and while many of them looked good, the actual ingredients and descriptions did not excite me that much.  I finally went with a tart that was topped with pistachio cream, raspberry cream and fresh raspberries.  The raspberries were fresh.  The abundant use of raspberries here made the dessert here quite tart, but the pistachio cream was cool and mild and that helped.

While I enjoyed the topping (even though I would not say it was great), I was not a fan of the tart base (it looked cake-like, but it almost pie crust-like).  It was very hard and dry.  I would have preferred a lighter cake base or a flaky puff pastry.

Service was okay.  The server was not that knowledgeable about the desserts here, which made ordering difficult.

Prices for the individual cakes were a little high, but I think that is to be expected given the arty presentations and the fact that the shop is in Las Vegas.  While I did not get a good look at the prices for the gelato, from what I saw, the gelato seemed to be reasonably priced compared to other Vegas spots.

Jean Philippe Patisserie has a lot of attractive desserts.  The chocolates here looked like they would make good gifts.  I would consider coming to Jean Philippe again to try other things.  But based on this one experience, I would have to say that I enjoyed the desserts/sweets more at Vosges (Caesars Palace) and Bouchon Bakery (Venetian).

Aria has complimentary valet parking.  I imagine that they also feature complimentary self-parking.

You know... when it comes to desserts a particular subgroup in the LV yelp scene has declared Snowflake as their common  place to end their nights after events. Truthfully, I liked Snowflake a lot for a ton of reasons, but I would rather "check-in" at Art of Flavors any day. I don't think I have ever had service, ice cream, and espresso that could ever compare to this place. Not to mention the prices are really low. 

If you are a tourist reading this review, I recommend stopping here during your next visit. Desyree's Art of Flavors truly is one of the best things we got here in Las Vegas. 

For many years I declined to eat gelatto. The only times I ever ate it was at Caesar's Palace, Venetian, and the buffet at Rio. At Caesar's, I got piss awful service, and the smallest gelatto they had costed me $14.00. At Venetian the dude working there who was covered in tattoos and piercings had no clue what gelatto was. But he told me that their gelatto is pre-made at a different location. And the gelatto at the Rio buffet gave me aids. Here at Art of Flavors, the ingredients are all organic and natural. They ain't gonna use any artificial ingredients ever. And the service is incredible. No matter how busy it is, every single person will get individual attention.

Don't neglect the espresso next time you come here. I noticed that not very many people wrote about it in their reviews. The espresso here is so strong that you need to drink it with a spoon because drinking it too fast could stop your heart. I've never had real European espresso in my life, and it impressed me. 

I had no doubt that this place was gonna be good since Amanda vouched for it, but I didn't know it was  gonna be the best restaurant for dessert in Las Vegas.  

My friend Mel asked "where are all the 2, and 3 star reviews"..... It's because the Korean and Chinese yelpers haven't found out about this place yet to rate it down. (Come on, take a joke guys! I'm just busting your balls)

Bright lights. Shiny things. Grand opening signs.  Girls that look really good in yoga pants.  I can't explain why, but I do know that these are just some of the things I am hypnotically attracted to. Kinda like the blue alien from the planet Baab (Escape From Planet Earth).

So after a recent Yelp Helps event followed by a group dinner at Ramen Sora, I was ready for some sweets to end the day. But it was past regular business hour at SnowFlake, so I was really drawn to the bright lights through those large windows emanating from what I soon discovered to be a new dessert spot in Chinatown.  But I was too late. the business has closed for the day, and the cashier lady was already counting the register and getting ready to leave.

So 2 days passed and another Yelp Helps event, this time benefitting the Ronald McDonald House charity, plus an amazeball CMYE in Downtown Las Vegas.  And I finally made it to this new Vietnamese dessert spot while it is still opened. The interior is very clean, brightly lit and has some comfy looking couch seating near the back. Their menu is pretty extensive.  Offering Vietnamese desserts, blended coffee, milk tea, smoothies and cold and hot beverages.

Tonight I was most interested in checking out their Vietnamese desserts (Ch). After a brief glance at their menu I settled for the trusty #1 Bambu Special, which is made with young coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seed and coconut water.  I really enjoyed the longan and slurping the basil seeds and pandan jelly, but I thought the crushed ice diluted the coconut water too much.  I barely tasted it.  What I did like is the fact that they use good ingredients and fresh when available.  

What I like:
* Use of quality ingredients.
* In Chinatown next to Hot 'n Juicy (the location closest to Decatur).
* Clean!!! Or at least the appearance of being clean.
* You can customize the desserts adding or removing ingredients to suit your taste or craving.

What I didn't like:
* Too much crushed ice diluted the flavor of the dessert drink I ordered.
* Parking lot is tiny and usually full.  Must be all the massage customers.
Street parking on the side street is usually occupied, so you can find parking but will have to do more walking.

I will definitely comeback to check out other menu items, but for now I am only going to rate them worthy of 3 stars.

NO LATIN TRANSLATOR NECESSARY!

It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.

Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.

Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.

As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.

The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars. 

So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!

I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.

This past January marked a year my wife stopped smoking cigarettes.  So imagine my surprise when the one thing she wanted to do to mark the occasion was to...smoke hookah??  I personally hadn't done that in well over 6+ years.  28 reviews and counting with consistent 5 star reviews lead us to Layla.

Although it's a small place that can cater to maybe 6 groups total, it's like a really cool guy's basement.  That really cool guy happens to also be named Guy.  He recognized my wife and I instantly since we lived in the same apartment complex a couple of years ago and had neighboring parking spots.  Throughout our visit, Guy was super friendly, attentive and made us feel very welcome.  The big leather couches you sit on INSIST that you stay a while.       

We were informed that all their food was homemade so trying the falafel and hummus appetizer was an absolute must for me.  Their falafel rivals any other joint as the best in LV, crunchy outside and flavorful green inside.  I could tell right away that the hummus was homemade.  It tasted more like a super thick tahini sauce than your average hummus but I thought it accompanied the falafel really well.  I'll be sure to get it again.  We also got an order of stuffed grape leaves and a nice basket of freshly toasted pita.  Guy also hooked us up with a couple of pieces of baklava which made for a nice ending to the meal.

Hookah time.  Lots of choices and my wife chose their "pina colada" which was fine and tasted as advertised.  3 bricks would have been enough for 4-6 people to smoke let alone two.

Count on me as a repeat customer!  At the very least I'll order their great Middle Eastern food to go since they're open so late or we'll lounge out the next time my wife has "the itch".

***I was disappointed with O; it could just be that I am not a big fan of Cirque du Soleil shows, but I felt this one had quite a few boring parts and it was expensive (but understandable considering its popularity); there were definitely some great spectacle moments, but not enough for me to truly enjoy this one***

The first Cirque du Soleil show I saw was Ka and after having seen Mystere and O since then, I think Cirque du Soleil is not for me.  I liked Ka though I thought it was a little slow in parts and did not have much in terms of high flying acrobatics.  Mystere had more acrobatics, but it had no story (only a series of vignettes) and it just kind of meandered and did not have the spectacle of Ka.  O is kind of like a cross between Ka and Mystere.  It has the spectacle of Ka and the disjointed series of vignettes with no story of Mystere.

The signature element of O is the water, of course.  It is nicely done, but it does get repetitive with all of the synchornized swimming.  They do a lot of nice diving elements including some very high dives that is impressive.

Despite the uniqueness of using water (which definitely goes well with Bellagio given their fountain show), I actually preferred the stage at Ka more.  I found that much more interesting and that along with some stylized touches and uses of curtains and lights made Ka feel much more cinematic.

Ka also had a storyline.  While it was not a great story, it did connect the scenes fairly well.  With O, there is no story.  It is much more like Mystere where there are just a series of acrobatic vignettes including mini-sections with clowns (while I did not love the lightly comedic clown elements of Mystere, I thought they were better than the clowns at O--the scenes were slow, uninteresting and not funny).

While there was no storyline, I think they could have done a better job of tying the vignettes together given the underlying connection of water.  There was not really an embracing of the water.  There were horses, a safari landscape and men dressed in long red coats and white wigs (they seemed to come from a different show all together).  There was even a maid, who pushed a laundry cart, and picked up the clothes (left thrown on the floor after a performer clothing change on-stage); pushing the cart was kind of all she did (I did not get that one; for all I know, Bellagio housekeeping could have just accidentally wandered onto the set).

I think more ocean-themed vignettes would have tied everything together though it could have potentially resulted in cheesiness if not done right.

Still, there were bright spots.  The first trapeze vignette, high above the water, was really interesting and I have not seen a trapeze act quite like the one at O.  It created kind of a nervous and exciting anticipation that was truly special.  The diving was good.  It did get a little repetitive, but there were some great dives--both from high up as well as exciting moments where divers were launched across the stage like rockets).

The arena was beautiful.  There was a greatly lit blue dome above seating and the opening and closing of the red curtain was nicely and very interestingly done.  Seating was comfortable too.

Ticket prices are expensive.  Because of O's popularity, it is hard to find discounted prices for O.  You could probably find similar tickets for Ka at maybe half the price and even less for Mystere.

O might be the most iconic show on The Strip so it is definitely one to consider if you are traveling to Las Vegas for the first time or are a big Cirque du Soleil fan.  If you are not a big Cirque fan or have never been to one of their shows, I would suggest seeing one of their more price friendly shows like Ka or Mystere first to see if this is the type of entertainment you really enjoy before paying the high prices for O.

Like other Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free and self parking.

This review is for the restaurant only. Please come here for dinner with a reservation if you would like to be treated like shit by both staff and management. In a town with hundreds of restaurants competing for business you would think they would consider customer service an important part of the customer experience. Especially since they are new here. We arrived this past Sunday evening at 9:32 PM for our 9:15 reservation for two people. Yes, we were late by 17 minutes. 
Hostess: Can I help you?
Me: Yes, reservation for David.
Hostess: What time?
Me: 9:15
Hostess: This reservation was cancelled after 15 minutes because you did not arrive on time. 
Me: OK, can we be seated still?
Hostess: I don't have anything. Just a moment.
At this point my wife says to me "let's go".  I take a walk back into the restaurant and see that about 25% of the tables are empty. This is a Sunday night at 9:30PM.  I come back and the hostess ignores me. I tell my wife that the hostess is a bitch and we should probably just go. We leave. 
As we enter the MGM casino a man starts yelling my name out loud. He chases us down and says he's the manager and asks why I called his hostess a bitch. Instead of being concerned that we are leaving without ever experiencing their restaurant he takes my private conversation with my wife and accuses me of calling their hostess a bitch. I would never do that and told him so. He continued to ask why I bothered his hostess. Very unprofessional, very harassing, we walked away and told him we were treated poorly and would be sharing our experience on YELP!  My wife's first intuition was to leave. I thought we would give them a chance to seat us but I was wrong. As usual my wife was correct.

Me and a friend received the tea service at 2 PM for $20 a person. Actually in comparison to other tea services, this is pretty cheap -- so it's worth it if you really love tea :) 

Ambiance: 5 - I'm surprised that there was no one in this restaurant at the time that I went! Although, it is upstairs in a little hard to see for visitors & tourists. 

The place is clean and nicely decorated. there is a huge bar inside and a gorgeous balcony where you can eat. Or, you can sit inside and enjoy the warmth of the restaurant.

Service: 5 - The service was perfect! Our server always checked on us to see if we were okay or needed more water for our tea. They came out with everything pretty fast. They were chill about us staying there, so we took our sweet time ;) 

Food: 4 - First, the tea: I got wild berry tea. it's served with actual tea leaves and is very tasty. If you require honey, you must ask! 

The Plates: The bottom tier of sandwiches was really good!! There are. 4 types, but I really enjoyed that smoked salmon sandwich. 

The 2nd tier was the scone! It came with jam and cream for spooning on top. That scone is delicious. It's not crazy sweet, but light and fluffy. Actually, I might do tea service again just for the scone. 

The top tier was dessert. It came with macarons, chocolate nuggets, and a delicious cream puff. The macaron was probably not their best choice to include, but that cream puff makes up for it!!! 

Desserts change too; you may request certain desserts if they have them available! 

This is a calm, romantic spot for tea lovers! I'll probably be going again!

Eight of us came to this Ethiopian restaurant for dinner during Restaurant Week. Among all participating restaurants, we made the decision on Lalibela based on the strength of the prix fixe menu, availability of vegetarian and gluten-free options, and price.

We were seated immediately upon arrival and the interior was well lit, spacious, and clean. The seating arrangement started with a score of smaller tables that led to ours in the back. The vibe was casual and appropriate for groups of all sizes. 

My choice of appetizer, the Beet and Potato Salad, was a wonderful starter. The mix of chunky beet and potato came with great texture underscored by a light lemon vinaigrette flavor. This is one item I haven't had at Ethiopian restaurants, but it's something I would order again.

The main entre came with two forms of beef stews; pan-fried beef, chicken stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, salad, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. They were served on a bed of fluffy injera with just the right amount of sourness. I was addicted to the softness of the injera, and they were generous to replenish them whenever it was needed. 

The beef items were cut too small, but the spiciness was on point with purpose. The chicken needed to come with an egg, but the vegetarian platter was truly delicious. All the flavors were discernible, unlike some of the Ethiopian restaurants where the seasoning began to taste in uniform after a while. I particularly loved the spicy beef stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. My dinner companions really enjoyed their food as well.

For dessert, my choice of Mango Mousse Cake was a hit. Plating was not particularly striking but everyone raved about it once I passed around the table. It came with an intense mango flavor, soft custard-like texture, and a smooth refined finish. 

The restaurant became extremely busy by the time we left. And, for $15, the meal was a fantastic deal. I still think the execution was not as sophisticated as Awash, Meskerem, or Abyssinia, but when price and value are considered, this place can certainly go toe to toe with some of the better places around the country. Service was slow, but knowledgeable, responsive, and friendly. Interested diners should expect a good level of authenticity when it comes to the seasoning. Those interested should also be aware of their large portions--so be ready to take some of the food home. I'd be very interested in coming back for another feast.

I finally had dinner here after staying at the Venetian several times.  My friend and I ordered the escargots a la bourguignonne ($17.50 - red wine braised Burgundy snails w/ garlic butter & Bouchon pastry puff pastry);  petite plateau ($65 - a seafood tower w/ a 1/2 lobster, 8 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams and 8 mussels; gigot d'Agneau ($33.95 - roasted leg of lamb w/ wilted cavolo nero, garden rhubarb, nicoise olives, crispy panisse and lamb jus); and saumon poele ($36.50 - sauteed Scottish salmon ministra w/ manila clams, salsify, oyster mushrooms and young artichokes - not pictured).

The escargots were the best ones I have ever had.  In most restaurants the garlic and butter overpower the snails.  Not in this case.  The snails were large, uber fresh, super tender and their was just enough sauce to flavor the snails:  5 Stars.  The seafood tower was also excellent.  The seafood was uber fresh and the star of the tower was the oysters and clams.  The brininess of the ocean where each oyster came from stood out:  5 Stars.  Our entrees were very good.  The gigot d'Agneau was very well thought out by chef Thomas Keller.  The lamb was medium rare and the combination of sweetness of the cavolo nero (an Italian kale), and the tartness of the olives went well w/ the strong flavor of the lamb.  The crispness of the panisse (a chickpea flourcake) also contrasted nicely.  I did not snap a pic of my friend's salmon but he said it was very good also.

To accompany the meal we ordered a 1/2 bottle of Louis Jadot Beaune Theurons Pinot Noir ($50).  My friend is a wine connoisseur and he never steers us wrong.  The wine was excellent and the winery is one of the renowned ones in this region in France that produces light, fruity wines that go well w/ meat, seafood and cheese:  5 Stars.

The only downside to the meal was the service was spotty.  We arrived early and we went to have drinks in the bar.  We didn't see a waiter so I went to the bar.  There were two bartenders and one managerial type.  It took a while for one of the two bartenders to notice me.  In addition, when I asked to charge it to my room, the bartender said I had to fill out some slip - WTF?!?!?!  When I checked in the person said I could use my keycard to pay for meals, et al.  I ended up using my credit card.  Secondarily, when we were seated the hostess tried to put us in a table for two next to a post.  The seat next to the post did not have much hip room.  My friend and I are both 6'2" and 225+.  We asked to be seated at a table for four and the hostess displayed a bit of displeasure.  Come on girl!!!  It was not that busy and we were going to drop $300 - We deserved a large enough table to hold our Petite Plateau!!!  Lastly, the shrimp were not peeled and the lobster was not cracked.  We understood the foregoing because the chef wants to demonstrate the freshness of the seafood.  However, when we mentioned it to the waiter, all he did was apologize vs offering a solution.  I said OK, and ate the lobster head like a "Hombre de Cavernas", much to the chagrin of some clients.  F*ck em!!!  I wanted to get all the meat out:  2 Stars on service.

The ambiance is excellent.  There is a fresh seafood bar on your left when you walk in.  The bar is also very nice with a large clock in background.  Lastly, the restaurant reminds you of Bistro in Paris:  5 Stars.

I will definitely come back to Bouchon when I am in Vegas.  I always stay at the V, so Bouchon is easy to find on the 10th floor.

Came here for dinner the other night and I was glad to finally check this place out. Inside isn't huge, but it was clean and there was a girl constantly cleaning tables and the floor under them. The woman at the counter who took our order was nice and gave us a number to put on the table. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but the place was busy and they claimed to be making everything fresh so I didn't mind.

I ordered a side "Classic Greek Salad" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum! Hubby got a burger (said the patty seemed frozen) and made it a combo with "Feta Fries" for us to share. The fries were excellent! Especially dipped in some of their tzaziki. I will be back to try a gyro and baklava. 

They also have tables outside if eating inside isn't your thing or you can call ahead and place your order to-go. Ask about their family meal deals, they have a couple to choose from.

"I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found? 
What's this?" - J. Skellington


The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.

Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.

Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.

Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...

Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.

Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!

And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay

Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!

One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !

And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day

Wow... and I mean WOW!!! We booked at Bally's because we got a deal and I don't think this review will express how fantastic our room was! We stayed in room 7206 in the newly renovated Jubilee tower and our suite was GIGANTIC. They say size doesn't matter, but those folks aren't staying in a suite! 

Our room had two queen sized beds, a living room, giant TV, two desks and a rather large area in the corner that puzzled us for a bit. I finally realized that the space is left vacant so guests can request roll away beds via housekeeping. Genius! You spend little time in your hotel room in Vegas so this totally makes sense if you've got a big group of people. In addition to a great view, our room came with mini fridge and fully stocked coffee maker. Right outside our room was the ice machine and 

The location is perfect as it's right across from Cromwell's / Drai's Beach Club, Caesars and Bellagio. A few minutes walk away from great shopping and my favorite pizza at the Cosmo. Although the casino isn't fancy, that's totally okay with me because that means the tables are much cheaper to play at than it's nearby counterparts. Even the pool was wonderful in that it was super chill and great for taking a dip before a night out on the town. The only negative we had during our weekend getaway was the elevators do take awhile sometimes but man, were we entertained by all the characters! 

If you're looking for a sweet deal and perfect location, Bally's is the place for you and your party posse! It's a 1950s relic that's finally stepping into the now. Make sure you get upgraded to the new tower because it'll make all the difference!!!

This has definitely become one of my favorite spots for an evening of wine! 

I've been here a few times and have loved it ever since the first day. There are so many great things about this place. I love the atmosphere and the way the place is set up. When you walk in you can grab a table or sit by the cozy little fireplace that they have. I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe. 

As far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you. 

All in all, it's such a great place to hang out with some friends for some amazing wine or also the perfect date spot. Take your ladies here fellas! They won't be disappointed. =P

My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small "Noodle Pot" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. 

This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. 

For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.

P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.

I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!

I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.

Many people write reviews for the various "businesses" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several "businesses" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in "Stoned Grove" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... 

One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  

Here are my reviews of places on the farm:

Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)
Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw

Succulentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w

The Farm Kitchen 
(Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  "The Farm Driveway".)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self

Morning Glory 
(Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6A


There are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp
Weddings:
(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)

Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):
http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix

Botanica (Been here once, but no review)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3

This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later.

There aren't many of us out there, but I'm Luxy enough for this to be my neighborhood coffee stop.

Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing. 

While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.

Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from "home" type of thing.

Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app. 

The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!

Happy Yelping Phoenix! It's time for today's caffeine fix.

I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered "The Prosciutto" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich "panini" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. 

If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

We walked in here without a reservation on a Saturday night and ate at the bar.  I am super late on the Honey Salt bandwagon.  So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called "Breaking Bad".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  

The creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  

I got "My Wife's Favorite Salad" consisting of duck confit, arugula, frise, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  

We split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  

Our super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting "The Brookie" for dessert which the menu describes "chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream".  You should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  I feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  

Overall it was great.  What's not to like about this spot?

Ellis Island, you are dead to me!

Oh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.

Ellis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your "center cut sirloin" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into "steaks."

But, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.

I arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a "steak" dinner. We were unenthusiastically "greeted" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.

After a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, "Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?" He got even closer to me and yelled, "No!" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, "Don't threaten me!" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.

Amazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.

Forte was mysteriously closed on a recent Saturday night, yet my wife was unable to shake her hunger for Eastern European cuisine.  Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials "you're not you when you're hungry"?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. 

I found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!

Our friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entres were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    

I should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  
   
Got talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  

So the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!

As the name suggests, this is not a place that screams nice sit down meal to impress a date located in a run down strip mall on Desert Inn Road, but your aforementioned date would be indubitably impressed if you brought their food over to her place and curled up to watch a nice romantic movie such as Thai-tanic or any within the Thai-light Saga if she happens to be a fan of Thai-lor Larb-ner (my apologies for the pad thai puns, alas it couldn't be helped).

While Archie's and Pin Kao are familiar Thai lunch staples to the Vegas locals, this hidden gem on the east side of town excels in value and authenticity.   To start off, you automatically knock off a few bucks simply by checking in on Yelp and receiving a complementary Thai iced tea, an always refreshingly cool, creamy, and sweet beverage to neutralize even the spiciest of meals.  One then has the options for the $5.95 lunch specials which include choice of main entree, soup of the day, steamed or fried rice, and veggie egg roll or chicken pot sticker.   The standout option is the green curry.  They are not shy on spice, so my advice would be to order at about 5-6 if you like spicy, and titrate upward with the dry chili flakes at your table since that is essentially what they add to increase the spice level.  My experience with 7 or higher is that the spice overpowers the other flavors and it is not a pleasant experience, especially if you are ordering noodles or fried rice since you can at least extinguish some heat from the curries with steamed rice.  

Whereas Pin Kao is heavy handed with the coconut milk and Archie's can be a tad on the oily side, the curries here are remarkably balanced and packed with vibrant and distinct flavors from the herbs and spices.  All the meats and vegetables components are fresh and well-cooked with toothsome textures.   A few items I've tried off the beaten path include the spicy crab noodle (think vinegary pad thai with bits of spicy crab), thai bbq chicken served with a side of papaya salad and sticky rice (aptly named "the three buddies", there's probably a food porn joke somewhere in here involving the words threesome and sticky, but I will keep this review PG), and the crispy fried pork (good flavors but way too salty).  The noodle soups are unmemorable and the one dish to avoid at all costs is the mee krob.  I've been wanting to try a solid rendition of mee krob (roughly translates to "crispy noodles") which is akin to hong kong style pan-fried noodles topped with a meat/vegetable starchy gravy but having a sweet acidic component and using rice noodles instead of egg noodles, yet the rendition here uses cheap chow mein noodles and drowned with a msg-laden sauce that reminds me of a premium bowl of cup-o-ramen.  I'm going to pretend this dish never happened.  Based on other yelper's photos, the whole fried tilapia topped with a spicy mango relish and the mango sticky rice look pretty legit so they are on the agenda for future visits.  All in all, a solid local mom/pop Thai joint that is easy on the wallet, loaded with authentic flavors,  and hits the spot if you are looking for a quick bite or as a solid take out option on the east side of town.

(Impression mainly from soft opening)

Note: You should love the noble piglet! Pork and pork based items dominates ~96% of their non-beverage menu.

There has been a lot of buzz regarding the opening of Hiromaru Fusion Ramen since the Ramen Festival at the Rio last year. And finally they are opened for business! Excited!!!

What I love about this type of ramen restaurants is the fact that their menu is so simple and straightforward. Just four (4) ramen to select from, and whether to upgrade some add-ons to the ramen (extra Chashu, roasted seaweed and even cheese!), or side orders of Gyoza, Chashu Pork Bowl, Karaage, Curry and Hiromaru Buns. None of that 150 menu items from your typical Chinese American Take-Out restaurants, or the 10 page menus at older American diners. Essentially their laser focus attention to making what few items they have on their menu to the highest degree of expertise their kitchen crew can mustered on a daily basis is what I admire. 

So here is what you can order from their 1 page menu:

Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - the chef's signature fusion ramen inspired by the Italian Carbonara pasta. The soup base consist of Tonkotsu pork broth and milk (expect watery broth and not thick traditional Carbonara pasta sauce). It is topped with still runny egg yolk, bacon, Shio and fresh scallions, resulting in a beautiful presentation of yummy ramenness.  Flat thick noodle is served with this bowl of ramen, I assume to better grip the creamy fusion ramen broth, but eating this without making any unintentional splashes is very difficult. If you can manage that difficult task, mad props to you Ninja!

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - according to the Chef and the menu, "the best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil."  I have not heard or read otherwise, so I shall defer to the ramen expert on this one. This most traditional of the 4 ramen options is served with Tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions and Kikurage tops thin ramen noodles to complete this entree. The soup is delicious (at my limit for how salty I like my ramen broth), but I prefer slightly thicker and chewier ramen.

Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95) - this is a special salted ramen made with Chef Kawai's master's secret "Ma-Yu" (black garlic oil) recipe.  It is essentially the Shiroi Tonkotsu with the special ma-yu.

Tate-Yama Ramen ($9.95) - easily the tallest ramen you can order from the menu, which is inspired by the largest mountain in Chef Kawai's home prefecture. The double portion of thick ramen (aka Kaedama) and mounds of vegetables (bean sprouts & cabbage), is served with a soy sauce base + salted sauce and baby-backbone fat, Chasu, hard-boiled egg.

The typical ramen-ya side dishes are available for ordering and some. The Hiromaru Buns (steamed buns + Butabara pork belly in original Hiromaru sauce) sounds amazing and tasted as good as it looks! The Japanese mayo with the lettuce was an interesting creamy touch.  Chicken Karaage was fried nicely, but still moist inside and is perfect as is or with a light squeeze of lemon.

No alcohol is served, at least not now, but sodas and teas and bottled water are available to help lower the sodium concentration is your stomach.

The decor is simple and modern, they really did a great job renovating the space vacated by Cafe de Japon. Even the large "private" room off to the side looks nice and inviting, and ready to accommodate patrons.

Fast service, yummy food and attentive staff, so far so good! Ramen portion is average or slightly smaller, I can do 2 bowls for sure, maybe 3 bowls when I am in beast mode. So the 2x ramen noodle option at the time you place your order is recommended if you frequent food eating contests.

5 ramen spoons outta 5.

Ashlee Simpson celebrated her birthday at Wet Republic last weekend: Hot.

I celebrated my birthday at Wet Republic this weekend: HOTTER!

You know you're having a truly fabulous time if you're taking shots with complete strangers and then find yourself having a chicken fight with random people in the pool. 

There's eye candy galore for all; everyone there is beautiful. We even spotted a Brad Pitt and Angelina look-a-like couple. They could have really been there, but we were so sloshed, who knows. 

We arrived early - at 11am to be exact. Doors opened five minutes later, and since we were pretty much the only people there, all of us girls got in free. Surprisingly, there was no line, since you typically have to get there at least half an hour before doors open to get in line. We were also lucky to get first pick of chairs (green lounge chairs inside the pool are the only free seats), so we got the best ones near the pool. We got the two $100 chairs (the drink/food minimum) on one end of the pool that were situated in their own little cove with two green chairs right next to them. 

The $100 minimum is easily met, especially if you get pitchers of their frozen drinks (the frozen watermelon mojitos are awesome), which start at $75. Plus the food is really yummy, and are huge portions meant for sharing. We got a bucket of tasty chicken tenders and waffle fries, and the Philly cheese steak quesadillas (only so-so). 

Although the pool was pretty dead to start, it got crazy later on. Now, if you can party all day here, in the sun, drinking non-stop, and still be able to go out clubbing until 4am, I take my hat off to you; you are a true rockstar.

I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.

Kuro ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.

Shoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.

Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. 

Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!
Nose ~ Smells good!.
Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!
Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!
Tummy ~ Satisfied.

What to write for my 1600th review?

Sometimes, sage sayings can be contradictory. For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!

With certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal

However, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)

I made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked

The restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced

1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu
I usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster

2. Trio of hamachi
This delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations

3. Sashimi duo
My first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi

4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips
The beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips

5. Ezi Ebi
If I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case

6. Niku
Braised Kobe-style short rib was served with sauted foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual

7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms
No ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!

8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root

9. Dessert Tasting
Raspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal

As you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients

As for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!

WOW, I think I am in meat heaven!

So we accidentally found this place when we were having lunch in the same little strip mall and let me tell you, we lucked out today!  My husband and I are carnivores through and through.  I think we could give a T. Rex a run for his money if someone was dangling a ribeye in front of us!

When we walked in, it was almost over whelming with all of the beautiful cuts of steak, pork, seafood, deli meats, homemade sausage in numerous flavors, and even specialities items like East Coast Scrapple.  I know I started to drool right away and I noticed my husband's eyes glazed over with pure happiness at the sight of the amazing steaks on display.  We walked in to check it out and left with $50 worth for steak and other treats for the next couple of nights.  SCORE!

So this is actually a branch of The Butcher Block on the south end of town.  We used to live out there and would frequent it often for when we wanted something special for dinner or a party.  We missed it living up on the North end and thought we would just have to eat boring supermarket steaks from here on out.  Well our prayers have been answered!  We were speaking with the owner, who was working the counter, and he told us that it was the same place and he would treat us good from here on out.  WooHoo!

Yes, the prices are higher here for the items for sale, but the prices are worth it once you try these steaks.  They have so much more flavor, more tender, and just much better than what you can find at the big name stores.  The product here is just fresher and it can't be beat.  And in reality, the prices weren't outrageous.  We got boneless ribeye steaks for $13.99 per lb, their super special BBQ hamburger mix for $4.99 per lb, and Boar's Head smoked turkey breast for $8.99 per lb.  No scrapple for us this time, we weren't brave enough this time.

If you want a great steak without having to get gussied up to go to a steakhouse, go check out The Butcher Block for their yummy delights!

I always make a point to inquire as to what people do for Christmas dinner. This is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures, when in reality I'm just looking for a scapegoat. 

Just once, when someone screams "YOU EAT CHEF BOYARDEE FOR CHRISTMAS!?" at me, I'd like to be able to say "oh yeah...well [insert your name] eats [insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce]!"

For like, a long time, my family have made hand-made ravioli for Christmas. It's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a Sunday afternoon. So naturally that's when I decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from Tammie Coe.

We're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when I call to see when they close. 

The ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish. 

And guess how much longer Tammie Coe was open? That's right, 2-3 hours.

The smell of dough still fresh on my threads, Misty S and I jetted (or should I say "jetta'd"...fuck you) to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food. 

Now, I had been to Tammie Coe quite a few times,  usually in tow with Amanda B. Since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup, I usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats. I simply sip on a peach tea and pretend I'm not starving for some fucking cake.

But there we were, on a Sunday morning, dressed in our pajamas, having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making.

Misty S said looking at all the food made her hungry.

Well, yeah.

Saying that Tammie Coe doesn't make you hungry is like saying Bandaids doesn't bring you deep, deep shame.

So along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders, a peach tea, iced chai, and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies I like to call "diabetes frisbees".

The sliders were all kinds of delicious. Even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so. And considering the prices at other places in the area, you're not going to beat a $2 sandwich. Unless you rob the place.

Would a yelp review count as evidence in court? 

"Your honor, I present to you Exhibit Y, where the defendant  writes 'and as I walked out of the restaurant, money in hand, the cowering hostess muttered to me 'thank you for coming, have a nice day'. Three stars for outstanding hospitality." 

The peach tea was, as expected, great. I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is. The few sips I had of Misty's iced chai latte were above and beyond Starbucks quality. 

But then again, what isn't?

I so badly wish that this place would open up in Portland. It just doesn't make sense that we don't have a Vila Argave. When you're seated here, you're asked if this is your first time in the restaurant. There's a good reason for that, so be patient, because when you say that it's your first time, they will give you a very thorough explanation of the menu, but only after bringing you the complimentary breads and spreads that start you off to a wonderful experience. 

It might feel for just a moment that the explanations of the menu items are wordy or lengthy- they're not. It's just that there's a LOT to choose from, and some of them are things that might be a bit "exotic" for the good ol' 'merkin. There are snails, among other things. They look absolutely delicious though, and next time, we will try them. This time, we tried the calamari. 

One of the brilliant features of Vila is that barely ANYTHING is fried. The calamari comes in a light, delicious cream sauce over herbed rice. It is mouth-watering, and we damn-near impaled eachother with forks over the last piece. I don't know if we'll ever have the CHANCE to try the snails, because the calamari is so craveable. 

Claire ordered the marinated grilled Portuguese chicken, and I tried it. It was marvelous. Something to know about this selection- if you order it, be comfortable with a 20 minute or more wait. This is NOT KFC. The chicken is cooked fresh when you order it. As a result, it is spectacular. Get over yourself. 

I ordered the seafood pasta, and I'm not sure, at this point, that I'd be able to bring myself to order anything else. Rather than a heavy alfredo, as most restaurants tend to serve over their seafood pastas, this selection is adorned with a creamy, tomato sauce akin to vodka sauce (my mouth was too full to ask exactly what it was, and to be perfectly honest, I don't care). This is by far the best pasta dish I have had from any restaurant. Especially with seafood. The scallops in my dish tasted extremely fresh. Everything did, really. 

What would I change about this place? Absolutely nothing. Except that it's in Las Vegas and not Portland. The owner is a magnificent human being who engages her clientele for feedback so she knows what to nip and tuck about her establishment. The night that we came in was a karaoke night, and I will not hesitate to mention that this place is not only gay friendly, but it absolutely EMBRACES the gay community. All around perfect dining experience. Would recommend, insist, and return.

Is it me, or do all the gorgeous people somehow end up in XS? Write this down - get glammed up, or else you'll feel out of place.

I take back my previous 3-star review. Next to TAO, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas. The decor is absolutely breathtaking and I love the spaciousness of both the dance floor and the outdoor pool. 

Did you know you can dance in the pool?? So awesome.

Unlike a lot of other party spots in LV, security inside isn't too strict about groups of drunkies raiding empty tables and beds. There's so many VIP areas available, you won't have someone breathing down your neck if you want to steal one to rest your feet for a few minutes. 

However, I can't say the same thing about the bouncers in front managing the line.

They've gotten a bit more organized about their lines now (THANK GOODNESS), but the guys that work them are still pricks that want ridiculous tips for a favor. With that being said, I've learned a trick that I think everyone should take into consideration:

- Get in line by 9:30 (make sure you scout for passes beforehand if you're a lady)
- Get stamped by 10.
- Go back up to your room for drinks.
- Come back down at midnight and pass up the fat line that wraps around to the Wynn Theater.

Why does this work? - You'll only need to wait about 20-30 minutes rather than over an hour, you'll get a good buzz without having to drop bills at the bar, you'll get to feel like VIP walking past everyone else standing in line when you return, and the music doesn't really get goin' until after 12am anyway.

I'm a genius. Thank me later. ;)

Had an interesting breakfast today, since my Shanghai Boofay lunch was so early.  
MikeC, NormR, RandH, DarenC, and I met up at the place which has recently opened in the carcass of the former original location of China Star Boofay, in the carcass of a former Red Lobster, near 43rd Ave and Bell Rd in North Phoenix.
So since there will soon be several thorough reviews from notable Yelpilluminati, I will stick to those areas that are uniquely mine:

Greasy~Crispy Spectrum:
.-. 4 stars .-.  nothing was too soggy at all, and there was a crispy outside on very many dishes.  Bonus that the terryaki chicken appeared not to have been deep fried but perhaps baked.

Discard Pile:
.-. 4 stars .-.  i had very little to cut off or spit out (thinking even of the short ribs) and most dishes actually had absolutely zero Discard Pile.  Notable were both the honey and orange chicken, and a nice crisped-up outside on the wontons.

McKenna Novelty Factor:
.-. 5 stars .-. (here's another category, newly named, for how i judge a boofay, whether it's got the 'same old same old' or it has unique items that you can't get just anywhere)  Shanghai had several items that were pretty novel.  Scoop-it-yer-damn-self Thrifty ice cream in about 8 different flavors.  Sushi bar that included seaweed salad and other acoutrements.  Also of note was what Norm said was called a Dessert Soup, which had a yellowish syrupy looking liquid with a small amount of blanched peanuts and red grapes floating in it, along with what at first apeared to be bits of tripe, like in menudo! Norm later figured out that it was ceylon agar (just think of it as vegan gelatin - it's from seaweed!), and with the server's help, that the small round fruits that looked like small apricots or orange lychee, were in fact a chinese fruit called loquat, we supposed related to the cumquat, every gradeschool boy's favorite thing to call someone as a name, since it's a real fuit and how can you get in trouble for that?

RyanC-isms:
.-. 3 stars .-.  A few personal favorites were missing, such as bean sprouts and a General tsao-type chicken (the spicy chicken they had wasn't spicy at all, and was mostly jalapeno flavored).  I also wish I could have put some chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  The lone bowl of rainbow sprinkles made me wish for more of a sundae bar, although MikeC seemed to be doing very nicely with the cone(s)!
  $7-something for lunch is just allright since it doesn't include the drink.   The decor is comfortable and clean.  The service was excellent, with plates cleared quickly, and friendliness all around.   The nice ladies found answers to our questions and even took our picture, too!

(Review of buffet only)

Interesting choice of location to set up a new Indian buffet on the east side of town considering you have Mint, India Masala, Origin India, Gandhi, and Taste of India all within a 2 mile radius, although I think it's the others that should be intimidated, since the new kid in town has got some bhangra swagger.  Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.  

Upon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)

As one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.  

I almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.  

Service was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch.

On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. 

Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. 

So, we ordered: 
- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA 

- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. 

- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. 

Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.

I've been looking for a great Persian restaurant since my last dining experience at Doostan. It was quite a drive for me, but I enjoyed the food so much that I came for dinner twice within the same week. The vibe seemed subdued from the lack of patrons, but the quiet atmosphere made it a cozy place to bring dates and small gatherings. Along with the front patio, there was a full bar situated next to the entrance. Past the partition was the dining area with scores of smaller tables surrounding the long vertical one for large gatherings. The blue, purple, and beige dcor nicely complemented the warm lighting and a number of paintings on the walls.

Their complementary pita bread was thick, fluffy, and pillow-like with a hint of smoke. It was a great starter with Halim Bademjan ($7.50) assembled with fried eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and other seasoning. The consistency was not as thick or flavorful as the one at Flame International. However, the pronounced garlic flavor was a hit when added to the soft smoky pita. My only wish was for the eggplant flavor to stand out more. It was good, but not mind blowing.

The Lamb Shish-Kebab ($21) was put together with chunks of marinated lamb, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and at my request, cherry rice ($4.50).  The lamb was tender and moist with full-on flavor. The cuts were chewy, but I could taste the saffron as the mix of cherry was delicious in the basmati. For the price, I wished there could be more cherries in the basmati, but the lamb made quite an impression. 

The Chicken Shish-Kebab ($17) arrived with charbroiled marinated chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and choice of dill and lima beans rice ($4.5). The chicken came with tremendous wow factor: super moist, juicy, and flavorful. The dill and lima beans basmati was not overpowering, and instead the taste was complementary to the chicken.

The Cornish Hen Kebob ($17) was equally outstanding. This dish came with an entire Cornish Hen served bone-in, and each piece was evenly cooked to perfection to render a meaty juicy sensation. The cherry rice was again a hit. I will go the distance whenever I can find cherry rice. 

Lastly, the Salmon Kebob ($18.50) came with marinated salmon and basmati rice mixed with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro. The salmon was tender but slightly overdone. The rice had a smooth refined flaovr as a secondary to provide depth. I wasn't particularly blown away by this dish, especially since the previous dishes were really outstanding. Among them, I'm still partial to the Lamb and Chicken Kebob. 

Service was inconsistent, as my dining companion drank from a dirty glass without knowing it until the end of his meal. My second visit fared much better. The server was knowledgeable, friendly, highly attentive, and invited us to return. Here's one of the few legitimate places to grab Persian cuisine in this area. I'd be very interested in coming back to try the Persian Ice Cream, Baklava, and Zoombia & Bamieh.

If you want to splurge on a very tasty dinner, Del Frisco's is definitely one spot you should check out. This restaurant is a change of pace since it is located off the strip. The staff here provides impeccable service as well as an overall pleasant experience.

The sesame bread that they give you is freakin addicting that I regret not saving room for my steak. I had their signature drink, the VIP (a pineapple infused vodka), but I stopped after one because it did taste like a bad hangover waiting to happen. I normally don't eat seafood, but I actually thought the crab cake tasted good.

This is one of the very few places I've ever dined where I can say I was babied (in a good way)! They cut and served our lobster, served our lobster mac & cheese, served our potatoes au gratin, help split the humongous tomahawk wagyu into two portions, and even helped another Yelper take foodie pics muahaha. I should've visited the restroom to see if they wipe for me too!

I had the prime ribeye which was awesomely delicious and cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested. It was a 16oz hunk of meat that I wished came in a smaller portion (never thought I'd ever say that). They definitely make it a priority to make sure the steak is cooked to your liking.

We came here for a birthday, and it was a cute little touch that the staff all signed a card for the celebrant. We got to indulge in a six-layer lemon cake which was so light and yummy without it being overly sweet.

I would definitely return in the future, but will make sure I come back with a bigger appetite.

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

Tao is a foreign word, which loosely translates to "panty-dropper."  Wait a minute, it doesn't?  Those guys lied to me? 

Jake, a really cool promotions guy, approached Lindsey and I on the street early last Saturday and asked if we wanted to get VIP entrance into Tao at 10 pm and have an open bar.  So, after thinking about this for 2 nanoseconds, we eagerly agreed.  We had dinner reservations at Tao for 11 pm, and figured that we could have a few free drinks before being seated downstairs. 

After calling Tao to confirm that our promoter was legit (although I wasn't too concerned, since Mama taught me how to disable taillights when trapped inside a predator's trunk), Lindsey and I brought our sexy selves to the Girl's Only VIP line.  We received our wristbands and were quickly ushered in - past at least one hundred clubgoers in waiting (some people wait all night and are never permitted entry).  

At one of the bars (there are 3 on the main level and a few on "the beach" upstairs) the bartender sadly informed me that the best I could get with my free drink wristband is a Skyy and Red Bull.  Expecting a slap in the face from my high-maintenance friends, instead, he received squeals of delight.  Obviously, he isn't aware that we're girls who prefer top shelf but are just as happy shotgunning beers at a tailgate party.

After a delicious dinner at Tao (review to follow) we effortlessly re-entered the club upstairs.  There are three dance areas:  The large one on the main floor, one in a side room, and one upstairs at "the beach."  Beware of the single man that groups of guys send out to find cute girls and drag back to their table lair caveman style.

Being in a female-only group (although a male co-worker of mine was running around this place like a kid in a candy store) allowed us to receive the ultimate VIP treatment at this sexy "see and be scene" club.  It's nice having men in suits repeatedly request your presence at their special tables & VIP rooms with curtains - but not when the men's faces resemble that SNL skit where cousins breed with each other and spawn deformed offspring.  Also, the married men who were there to prove they "still got it" proved to be a little trying.  Come on, guys, do you think that we don't notice you keeping your left hands in your pockets, excusing yourselves to the restroom, coming back and gesturing with a tan-lined finger?  NiceGirl rule #84:  Don't do the nasty with guys who are taken.  Period.

Note: the restrooms are marked "Yin" and "Yang."  A little tipsy, I mistakenly wandered into the Yin room and saw a guy's Yang.  Not advisable (unless timed strategically after consuming copious amounts of high-proof liquor).


My favorite part?  "The Beach" upstairs.  Poolside setting (which is actually a hot place for sun and fun during the day), sexy environment, and a cool breeze to help you feel relaxed.

The motto of this Asian-inspired place is, "Always a Happy Ending."   Wow, that's gutsy.  Take with this what you like, but right around 4 am, Lindsey and I were forced to make a hasty retreat when the lights slightly brightened and the 4 am "bed partner" scramble began.  
Sorry dudes, we don't care if you do play for the Giants or really make that much money.  This is Vegas - everyone is a star.

Spread, spread, spread is what makes the newly renovated buffet at Caesar's phenomenal. The new layout and revamp of menu will give the Bellagio and Wynn a run for their money. 

Coming in for breakfast, I was impressed. It left me wondering what dinner was bound to feature. Near the entrance, in the morning, the cold bar is stocked with fresh juices. The beautiful display of colors draws the eyes in and my hand started grabbing. Orange, grapefruit, watermelon, and carrot were available for the taking. Fresh fruit and parfaits contain tropical fruits such as starfruit sit above.

The next line had many forms of bacon including turkey and three different kinds of pork. Eggs benedict come in a traditional form, but the one using the potato cake was way better. The chiliquiles were soggy since they were constructed ahead of time. The small portions in skillets give the perfect serving of most dishes. The little frying basket of maple tots were drool inducing. Plated servings of regular and red velvet pancakes are placed out as guest take them. Beautiful, the red velvet flavor was not present. Although this concept of single serving goodness is not new, Bacchanal does it much better. 

Moving on, there was an egg station which would prepare your eggs any way you wish or just pick from the rolls, pizzas, and quiche on display. A whole line was dedicated to bagels, lox, and spread. Some are made in advance, but you could easily make your own. 

Continue on for the thinly sliced prosciutto and other meats, then comes the cheese selection. At the very end there is an Asian section which includes the dim sum. I was not impressed with this offering. My friend and I paced ourselves because desserts are essential no matter what time it is.

Between two of us; we got a blackberry cobbler, four kinds of ice cream, a berries and nutella crepe, and waffles. I used the infused honey near the bread station instead of maple syrup for my waffle and it was magic. 

For $16.99, you will not find a better deal for breakfast.

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

We came here around six this past Saturday, and found SaladWorks refreshing.

Yes, I know it's a salad bar.  But it's much more.  It has frozen yogurt with various toppings.  It has...   wait for it...   a wide selection of bottle beer. Yes, beer.  Haven't you ever thought of combining your liquid carbohydrates with your protein?  If you're not into beer, they have wine, or soda.  They even carry the healthier beverage of water or seltzer.

What makes SaladWorks unique, is their focus on fresh.  They cut up each of their sixty or so salad items each morning, and throughout the day.  According to their corporate marketing speak: 

"In 1986, John Scardapane developed the Saladworks concept while working as a gourmet chef at a southern New Jersey country club.  Saladworks continually won over new fans with its fresh take on salads.  John's vision meant an end to the days of chemical-coated tomatoes and brown-tinged lettuce.  He decided that salads should be made to order, chopped on-location and assembled right in front of your eyes."  Yeah, for some reason I'm not a big fan of salad bars because of the "chemical-coated tomatoes and brown-tinged lettuce."  Problem solved.

Our meal ran us $18.28, including tax which seems a little high considering we were drinking water.  I opted for the "make your own salad" which has the drawback of $0.79 (protein is $0.99) for each item.  So in the future, I'll start with one of their base salads and add on from there.  

Interestingly, they do not have any vegetarian or vegan base offerings on the menu. D'oh!  All seem to come with a meat or fish protein attached to the salad, including the wraps.  They'll need to fix this going forward, or better educate the staff on the options.

The setup is pretty straight forward. The restaurant itself is brightly lit, very clean, and located in the old Starbucks/ Sushi restaurant location.  Since the restaurant is so new, it was funny watching cars pull up and then back out realizing the other places aren't here anymore.  Both are on the other side of FLW.

We'll be back.  Enjoy!

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

Wow. The sandwich game has been lifted. 

I came to Buddha Belly Deli after I saw a few Elites, one in particular (Shirley B.) frequented here about three times over the course of two weeks. That's some bodacious Buddha dedication. You know what though, her dedication was rightly placed. 

Not only is the food here amazing, but the staff is insanely helpful and friendly. With my hunger pains increasing I walked in and zero'd in on the "Schezwan Shrimp Po' Boy"... "yes please!" My lunchtime partner got the "Pho Dip", a very thinly sliced meaty sandwich, with pickled veggies piled high, and accompanied by a hot side of Pho broth. 

To kick-off this food frenzy, we also order smothered-fries. Now these aren't your drunken southern uncle's chili-fries, these are on another level. Crispy, thin french fries covered with a thai chili flavored pulled pork. They call this type of topping "Sloppy Joe", on the menu, but it's more than the all American slop you're most likely used to. It's a game changer in-deed. Simple, but amazing and once this hit the table it was game on! 

I'm pretty sure The Schezwen Shrimp Po' Boy had a dash of Viagra in it because I was getting more and more aroused with each flavor-filled bite. Loaded with fried shrimp, a spicy mayo, pickled jalapeos and a few other pepper options. This amazing concoction of sandwich fair was wedged between two very soft pieces of a french baguette. The shrimp was crispy on the outside, but still juicy and firm on the inside. Seriously I could have eaten two of these at one sitting.
 
Now, at this point my hunger monster was taking over and I noticed that my lunchtime partner still had half of her "Pho Dip" sammie on the plate. I asked her for a taste and before she could even answer I was already mid-bite. Soft bread, a big layer of thin sliced meat, and a perfect Pho broth to dip it in. This was pure magic. I ate almost the whole thing before coming out of my flavor induced black-out and seeing an angry glare staring back at me from across the table.

If you were to witness this gross display of gluttony, it would remind you of Shark Week's "best of" clips... you know where a shark's eyes roll into the back of their head before they viscously attack some poor unsuspecting tasty creature. I couldn't care less, no food shaming here. 

Honestly this isn't just a sandwich shop, but a place where the owners actually take pride in their food on many levels. There it is folks... The secret has been unlocked. Just take pride in your art and maybe something beautiful and tasty will come out of it. 

Whoa. That last line might be the Buddha talking.

Gold Dust Woman

Damn I really hate being THAT guy.  You know, the last on one the bandwagon...before everyone else has already jumped off because it's going down in flames.  Well, because of Lil Brown Sugar's Cupcakes, I officially jumped on board (feel free to exit the cabin at any time).

Over the past 3 weeks, I've sampled probably a dozen flavors and all of them were absolutely spot on.  First of all, if you've read any of my reviews of cupcake places (if not, I will find you and tape your eyelids open), I don't like frosting.  Yeah, I'm odd like that, but my kids love that they get an extra dose of kiddy crack.  These are the only cupcakes where I absolutely cannot pass up the frosting.  They capture the essence of the flavor in the frosting, like how Jelly Belly does in a jelly bean.  Seriously!  Here's a rundown:

1.  Key Lime - Hold your butt cheeks together otherwise you'll shit yourself.  The frosting tastes like a fluffy key lime pie.  Well, not "like" a key lime pie...EXACTLY like one.  I actually ate the frosting before the cupcake.  It so light and fluffy it feels like there aren't any calories, just angel dust.  The cupcake itself had a hint of lime, which was nice, but really, it was second fiddle to the frosting.

2.  Butter Beer - I think this was butterscotch cake batter mixed with cream soda topped with butterscotch frosting.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch, but the flavors were so rich and flavorful.  The cake was a little too dense for my wife's taste, but exactly how I like it.  

3.  Peanut Butter Cup - It was a chocolate cupcake with a Hershey Kiss baked inside, topped with peanut butter frosting.  I hate peanut butter, so this wasn't my cup of tea because it tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup (duh).  On the other hand, my wife and mother-in-law thought this was their favorite of all.

4.  Strawberry Lemonade - One of my favorites.  The cupcake is a strong lemon flavor.  Not tart and not sweet.  Just easily identifiable as lemon.  The frosting was on the sweeter side, so I did scrape off about half, but it perfectly complemented the cupcake to the point where it really did taste like a mild strawberry lemonade.  

5.  Orange Dreamsicle - Just like when Ego eats the ratatouille, my hanabata days memories of eating a Meadow Gold orange dreamsicle came rushing back.  This cupcake was like eating a fluffy one, and without the brain freeze.  Of all the flavors I've tried, this is the most subdued, yet highly addictive.

6.  Chocolate Covered Strawberry - Exactly as described, a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting.  Not quite the most memorable, but not too shabby either.  The fact that the frosting is mixed with FRESH strawberries gets points from me.

7.  S'mores - Dude.  Totally tastes like a s'more.  And nowhere near as sweet as a real one.  Chocolate (maybe it was Devil's Food) cupcake with marshmallow whip frosting, topped with crushed graham cracker.  My family still raves about this one.  

8.  Thin Mint Cake Pop - When the lady behind the counter told me it tastes like a Thin Mint, she wasn't kidding.  Sans the snap of the cookie, this thing is choco-minty goodness.  Get two of these and you almost have a box of the real thing.  

9.  Sugar Cookies - I buy these for my rug rats.  Haven't been able to taste them because they're usually gone.  I guess that means they're pretty good.

10.  Red Velvet - Tastes like red velvet.  Although it is exactly as described, I would have to say this is the most boring flavor offered (this statement comes from a guy who LOVES red velvet.  I'm the guy who bought my wife a red velvet birthday cake because hell, if I like it, she better like it too (right?)).  I suggest you do yourself a favor and try anything else in the case.

I would argue that these tasty nuggets don't contain brown sugar.  No, they must have been sprinkled with some gold dust because I'm ready to dig in with my silver spoon.

Hoi..1st to Review!

Give Manila's Best - A Taste of Home some lovin'!  It's a brand spankin' new place for some delicious Filipino eats!  Just opened about a week and a half ago.  Please check it out!

I'm a new fan because:

1) The owner is a cool dude!
2) The restaurant is clean!  The bathrooms are clean!
3) The food is good!

I cannot tell you how much a clean restaurant does for its reputation.  Being brand new you would expect cleanliness and Manila's Best has it in spades.  Let's hope they can keep it up this way, I feel much better eating in a place that pays attention to proper hygiene.

Like Filipino food from the Homeland? Manila's Best is the newest, tastiest place to go!  Seriously, the food here is down-home country, not pretentious, and tasty.  Yes, Filipino food tends to be heavy, but the folks here at Manila's Best keep the greasiness to a minimum.  Nothing on the line was sitting for too long or drowning in its own grease.

Here's some of the tender vittles on their menu:

-Rice (lots and lots of white rice)
-Bistek
-Pork Adobo
-Chicken Adobo
-Beef Afritada
-Grilled Pork Belly (damn delicious)
-Pancit
-Pork Sinigang (mmmm....sour)
-Chicken Tinola
-Fried Tilapia
-Fried Chicken Skin


I ate all of it...and loved it!  For me, I'm an Americanized Filipino and I noticed their food is lighter on the bagoong/patis side of the palette.  Which is a plus for me because DAMN sometimes my Nanay & Tatay are a bit heavy-handed on the fermented fish stuff!  But for you old skool' Filipinos I'm sure Manila's Best has some bagoong or patis on the side they can give you in case you're looking for that fishy feeling.

Manila's Best is really the best of both worlds, you can either enjoy a 2 or 3 item combo which includes rice and soup for under $7.  Or you can be a lechon like me and go all out for their special BUFFET....all-you-can-eat gloriousness for only $7.99 total!  Soft drink and tax already included!  Plus they give real plates, bowls, and silverware so you can feel like you're having a meal at home.  Things like that really add up to a great experience here.

I really enjoyed Manila's Best, and they are looking for customers!  It was lunch rush today (on a Payday Friday) and the place was near empty.  So sad, poor thing!  These folks need a push from some social media.  And I am here to help with my outstanding review!

So you like-a-da Filipino food, please visit Manila's Best!  Your belly and your wallet won't be sorry!  Best price of $7.99 for their lunch and dinner buffet!  You go now!

I think I will be going there again tonight.

MASARAP!

WOW! What a terrific find this place turned out to be.  During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo and low and behold this little gem of a coffee shop was right downstairs off the casino floor.  

After a long trip in the day before, including a late night show it was time for a quick pick me up.  We headed downstairs to Samablatte and decided to order a couple of drinks to help wake up a bit along with a couple of pastries for a light breakfast.  The staff here is very friendly and the menu is as diverse as they come for these type of places.  They offer everything from your standard drip coffees to blended drinks, teas, smoothies, pastries, sandwiches etc...

My wife went with the hot mocha and a scone while I opted for the hot white mocha and a apple turnover style pastry.  The drinks were FANTASTIC and definitely hit the spot (although I wish they were a bit bigger or came in multiple sizes).  My wife thought her scone was OK but the apple turnover was really good and filled with lots of apple.  Normally we are not big connoisseurs of the hot drinks but these were really good.  So much so that a return trip was made the next morning prior to our departure back home.

Trip two saw my wife get the same drink again but this time I went with the Penguin Hot Chocolate (White and Milk Chocolates).  This could possible have been the greatest hot chocolate I have ever had if not the best in all mankind, a definite recommendation.  The place has a great vibe to it, plenty of seating (both indoors and out) and is the perfect place to come down and hang out with a laptop and utilize the WiFi (only available on two floors of the Monte Carlo).  We are already missing this place bunches and will definitely be back here again  the next time we are in town.  My only regret is not trying it the day we got in as I would have loved to have tried the blended drinks or the incredible smoothie that was also on the menu.  If you love coffee then try this place out, it;s more than worth the trip.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends. 

Besides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub. The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding. 

One of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB). It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth. Granted the beer back then was warmer. LOL

As we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here. We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals. Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken. There was a lot of laughing. Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company. What a great atmosphere!

We started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling. Both hit the spot nicely. 

For dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50). I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!

Both, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.  In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette. But not here. Surprising they were only $9.00 each. Incredible. 

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00). Both were also delicious. 

Each of the above items were very filling. We couldn't finish them, or the desserts. So we had four "to go" boxes for later. I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.  Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities. 

We'll be back. Enjoy!

Just got done with "lunch" at Scramble, Sunnyslope's newest breakfast spot! They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:

They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: "breaking news."

My lunchmate and I tried one of their "signature breakfast pizzas" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected. 

That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...

Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).

I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.

Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!

Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.

The menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.  

A minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film "Casino" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!  

"Kibbeh Nayyeh": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.

I found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entre or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.  

There are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.

Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):

The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative.
http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelp
http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.html

Despite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.

Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?

With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.

Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.

I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.

I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.  
Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control.
Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you.
Sometimes they just make a mistake.

We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.   

-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Ryan C-
My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.

First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.

While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.

I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.  

I'd like to invite you back for a do-over ....
I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back. 

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.

Tom & Judie Philp
SteakenBurger"
---------------------------------------------------

The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.

Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it! 

I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.  
The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.  
The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.  

There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.  
I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)

In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !

A truly awesome experience!

Unlike the mansion, L'atelier is a much more casual restaurant coupled with a vibrant and interactive experience where the best seat in the house is actually at the counter!

Our server was warm friendly and helpful with the menu, which included the enticing Seasonal Discovery Tasting Menu. We all decided to go with that with wine pairings and our exhilarating journey began. We were started with an amuse bouche, which was a Parfait of foie gras with Parmesan cream coupled with a glass of Veuve Clicquot Champs.  The flavor profiles were impeccable. Creamy smooth fragrant and indulgent. A spectacular start to our meal.

The breads were warm and fluffy. My personal favorite was the buttery brioche that was flaky, light, and simply delicious. 

The first course was a beautiful Alaskan king crab on a delicate gelee and cream of spiced fresh peas. It was both refreshing and flavorful.

Next up were beautifully seared medallions of buttery diver scallops, which were served with a vibrant shimeji salad that brought out just the right amount of acidity to this wonderful dish.

La Cebette
A crisp white onion tart topped with savory smoked bacon green asparagus and crowned with a perfectly cooked quail egg. 
Easily one of my favorite dishes of the evening.

Seared duck foie gras
Served au torchon, this satisfying dish made me realize why I waited so long to enjoy foie gras in Vegas. Decadently rich, yet infinitely satisfying!

John Dory served with a crisp skin
This beautiful dish was served with a irresistible tomato saffron bouillon sauce that had a subtle earthy, fragrant flavor. 

Free range quail stuffed with foie gras. 
The quail leg was cooked to perfection and the stuffed quail was flavorful and rich.

Hanger steak
With a beautifully pink center and a melt in your mouth texture, this was easily the best cut of steak I had the pleasure to enjoy all weekend! Oh and the accompanying creamy mash potatoes? Like velvet and yes they're ridiculously good as everyone boasts! 

The mango mouse dessert was exemplary! A fantastic finish to our extraordinary meal.
It was cool, smooth creamy and fragrant. A combination quite fitting for any successful dessert 

The final dish was no "also ran" it was as easy on the eyes as it was on the palate. A bright and tantalizing Creme de menthe atop a decadently rich chocolate cake. It truly was a fantastic finale to our inspiring meal.

I can't speak enough about our experience here. Dining at the chef's table was a truly organic experience that involved a lot of interaction with the sommelier and staff on a personal level that made for an unforgettable experience I will cherish for years to come!

Bravo L'atelier!

Happy Eats!

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

I love German food!!!! I have always loved German food!!!! 

Oddly enough, Vegas is a German food Mecca of sorts - at least for our part of the country. I was amazed at how many German places I saw around Vegas! Especially since the town is not the biggest. I actually got to try two places and one of them was the fabulous Hofbrahaus!

I know that German food is not one of the most well known cuisines in the world since it is so simple but if you get to try it you will see there is true beauty in its simplicity!

To start with Hofbrauhaus is beautiful inside and out. The building looks like traditional German architecture on the outside and inside. The ceilings are high and they are painted really nicely. They have a stage for live bands too! Seating is on large tables with benches just like you would expect in a Munich beer hall!

My BF and I came here on our last day in Vegas and I decided to treat him with the money I got from the machines!

What is really cool, and even impressive is that some of the food items are actually flown in from Germany!!!! We had a large freshly flown in pretzel to start with and we found out that the red cabbage, bratwurst and sauerkraut are also flown in!!!! We had the veal bratwurst, the chicken bratwurst and two beers. Mine was a incredibly good special seasonal beer! We also tried the apple strudel which was also flown in! Everything was seriously very tasty!

This review, of course, is not truly complete since I did not get to be here during Oktoberfest! The ambience here must be truly incredible when it is that time of year! However, if this place gets five stars without all the excitement of Oktoberfest - it truly must be good and, trust me it is

Service was pretty good! While you wait they give you interesting little newspapers with all kinds of information about the restaurant and its events. Next time we come I will make sure we get to check out one of the live bands! Expect to spend a great deal of what you win at the machines haha! This place is not cheap! I shelled out about $90 for two with tip included!

Parking is no problem as you would expect in most places in Vegas! There is a large lot adjacent to the restaurant.

Being in Vegas and not wanting to eat at the Casino when we got in, I had bookmarked Eat after reading all the great reviews from LV Elite Yelpers and had to check this place out. Well I was truly glad that I got our group to let me choose the Saturday breakfast. (They actually had no choice I was driving)

Eat is roughly about a 5 minute drive from the California Hotel making it really convenient. Waiting only 10 minutes after we arrived at 9:00am we were seated in this nice trendy hipster place in downtown. The sound level was a little loud with the music and people chatting but it didn't deter us from enjoying the food and decor at Eat. 
Some of the items we ordered:

*Beignets http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ#FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ Great item to share, jam and mascarpone made this dish yums.
*Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg#--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg  I swear the hollandaise sauce must be one of the best I ever had! 
*Pancakes with chicken apple sausage: My friend took one bite and busted out a huge smile. I got to sample the pancakes, melt in your mouth and a slight crunch on the edges of the pancakes made this dish a must.
*Eggs with smoked bacon and smashed potatoes: Smoked bacon was that standout of this dish.

*Outside seating available
*Street Parking
*Friendly Service

*Eat is a must for breakfast when staying in Downtown*

It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... 

They will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!

Come earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like "Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!" here*

My suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.

They do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that one is longer than the other. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:

Your scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, "Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. 

All in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. 

All I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.

I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! 

Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I can

I actually got to attend the pre pre-show party on the 26th, which was more commonly known as the event that was supposed to be two hours long, around 1,000 people showed up, and not many got in.  The fact that I did feels nothing short of a miracle.  From what I gathered, the Facebook invite got leaked, so they got way overbooked, and just couldn't handle the traffic flow.  So a lot of people didn't get in, and a lot of people (understandably) weren't happy.  How that's going to affect the initial impression remains to be seen.

Conceptually, this place is very clever.  Simply put: I like theme bars and restaurants.  I still mourn the demise of the Star Trek Experience as it was just great fun, and nothing really has replaced it.

Goretorium is a year-round haunted house attraction with a bar.  All those places that pop up this time of year with mazes and blood and people jumping out at you?  This is a 365 day a year version of that.

Being the pre-opening, and considering the awkward crowd control, I don't think the place was 100% operational, so it's hard to critique in some ways.  The downstairs bar wasn't open, and it's hard to say if the upstairs bar is accessible to the general public, or just a bonus for the end of the horror experience.

As far as costumes go, they have some GREAT ghouls.  Zombies, mad scientists, magicians, and even "Bloody Mary" was really cool.  I've worked a few horror gigs over the years, and I was trying to figure out some of the special effects.  I'd like to see how they interact with the crowd under a "normal" day.

The maze was well done.  Plenty of lead up, a couple of nice jumps, lots of blood and trickery.  My friend accidentally walked into a wrong door (I followed, naturally my luck), and it led into a cast holding area.  Oops.  But they held in character, and they teased when we went down the "right" path.  I won't spoil the haunt itself as that's half the fun, but the end of the experience leads hapless wanderers into an upper level bar area with a nice view of the Strip.  They even have a unisex bathroom, so if you walk in, and something doesn't seem right, it actually is.  Someone could have warned me, though.  I had that initial "Oh, crap.  Wrong bathroom" moment, and I couldn't even excuse the mishap on too much liquor.

There were a few things I'd make note of.  I think $40 is simply too high a price to charge for the attraction, especially with the economy still being so "meh" right now.  $30?  I could better see that.  Locals discounts?  I'd strongly consider that, otherwise they are going to have to cater exclusively to tourists because unless you love horror, and I mean LOVE horror, the experience is fun, but a one time deal.  Especially for the price.

The gift shop wasn't much to look at, either.  Not a varied or wide selection, though it looked like they were selling prop surgical tools.

It's unfortunate that Goretorium seemed to have such a rough first night, and hopefully the bad taste will leave people's mouths so they give the place a chance later when it gets some kinks worked out.  I stayed out of all the "political" aspects, and as a customer, I had fun with my group of friends.

Goretorium has potential, and I love wacky theme bars, but the prices shouldn't be the scariest thing there.

It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. 

I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.

Outstanding Thai food on the East side and at the cheapest prices I've ever seen! Thank you to Yelper Shawn J's review for leading me to gold.

Normally I wait to write a review until after I have at least two dining experiences, but today I can't wait. Zero patience when it comes to spreading the good word about good food.

 5 STAR FLAVOR. $5.50 (Lunch Special Prices) Green Curry Chicken at 10 for heat level. Overall it was some of the best Green Curry I've encountered and the heat level was spot on. Nice balance of white meat chicken to vegetables and loaded with chiles. It's going to be hard for me to try anything else because it was that good.

 5 STAR SERVICE. The lady who helped me gets 5 stars just for her smile. She lit up the small restaurant with her smile and positive attitude.  Her spirit is contagious and I wish my coworkers could be more like her. I had a real funny thing I wrote right here about that, but thought it would be in my best interest to keep it to myself. (That's growth)

Why only 4 STARS you ask? 
1. Because I've only eaten here once and I am not going to high five a spot until I have tasted more of the menu.
2. This place is REALLY small. It was clean and bright, but it's just too small. Definitely not first date worthy unless the person is really cool and really loves Thai food and you. Then it would be ideal. 

I forgot to mention if you check in on Yelp you get a free Thai Tea if you are dining in. 

Thai Food To Go is not to be missed. One of the most flavorful, top quality meals around for 5 bucks. I might go back tomorrow to try the Pumpkin Curry on special right now!

I really wanted to give this place 3 stars but I just couldn't justify it.

I felt like Chris Tucker in this scene from Rush Hour 2

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrAIA4c_Mtk

So any place that gives me the feeling of "This place is off the hook!" deserves that 4th star.

I mean even for me, someone who normally leaves his credit card back in the room so I don't get stuck with reserving the table .... I knew that if I really wanted to go in, I better not take any chances.  And what do you know ... no one else wanted to slide their card.  

Fuck it ... XS is one of the newer spots in LV and I like new shit.

From the moment I walked into the newer portion of the Wynn called Encore, I could just see why they called the club XS.  I mean there was an excess of just about everything.  And when I say everything, I mean everything.  

Just come check it out, it's nice!

Just don't over do it like I did because you'll be calling it a night early after meeting everyone from the bachelorette parties, birthday parties, NBA players no longer in the playoffs and the dude who's table you climbed over because you couldn't find the path to the exit.

Let me give you a tip.  You really don't need to pay for table service if there's a small group of you unless you really want to.  Just go in line early, meaning before 10p and then when they start letting people in, pay cover and get your hand stamped then go out and you can come back later.  

That's right folks, they allow re-entry.

The place is huge inside and outside, yeah outside.  They have a huge outside area where you can just hang out with your group and sit along the planters or they have a gambling area, so you will definitely find some place just to chill and hang even if you don't have a table.

Come and judge for yourself ... I think you'll be impressed with the place.

I still prefer Tryst or Drais's but then again .. that's another story.

I have been hearing about the great cuisines in Phoenix and decided to come to this popular Italian restaurant to get a first impression. Located in a house with a spacious front patio, the interior encompassed a full bar area, breakout dining rooms, hardwood floors, and red brick walls. A friendly staff, constant foot traffic, and opportunities for people watching added to the festive, home-like atmosphere. I came here for dinner with a group of five that included fellow Yelpers Fia R, and Kurdy S, and decided to order antipasti and two pizzas to share. 

For antipasti, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered the Burrata ($14). The platter came with fresh mozzarella, balsamic drizzles, razor thin prosciutto, and toasted bread. I was impressed by the mozzarella, as it was light, airy, flavorful, and easy to spread across the warm crusty bread. The gentle flavors between the balsamic and prosciutto went hand in hand, as they complemented the mozzarella and bread without hindering it. This is a must get for those visiting for the first time. 

Next, we shared the half Diavola and half Magherita Pizza ($13). The Diavola was pleasantly spicy, as the pizza was inspired by the centrality of spicy salame embedded in mozzarella and tomato sauce. I also enjoyed the Margherita, as the light tasting tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil were spot on delicious. One noteworthy limitation regarding their pizza was the soft crust. It had a nice flavor but the texture was also flimsy and unexpected. 

Finally, we shared a half Procida and half Tartufata Pizza ($14). The Procida came with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper. The goat cheese flavor was very sharp, so I didn't particularly enjoy it as much as the other finesse tasting pizzas. The Tartufata arrived with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and white truffle oil drizzles. I enjoyed the smoky flavor stemming from the pizza, but the combination of strong-flavored white truffle oil and cheese didn't go particularly well for me. 

3.5 stars. Overall, it was a delicious meal with plenty to rave about. I suggest interested diners to be aware of possible long waits, especially for those arriving later in the evening. Additionally, I also would not suggest this place to those who have a strong preference for thin, crispy crust pizzas. Their desserts were also limited to crepes, which we didn't care for on that particular evening. I must say, the place is great for dates, but the noise level can be pretty loud. Despite these limitations, our water was constantly refilled, and we were attended to frequently without much interruption. It was a great way to start a new journey in Phoenix. I hope to find the perfect crust in the area before coming back.

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very "neat/cute" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.

My favorite item was the "Pig Face" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw

We also tried the following notable things:
Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink "Hey Bartender"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.

Holy Customer Service NIGHTMARE.

WOW. The lack of professionalism the entire staff showed leading up to our reservation followed through to 3 months later when our issue from NYE was not resolved... One word... NIGHTMARE. An all around headache that I would not care to every partake in ever again. 

Please note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However, that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. 

LONG story short:
Had a reserved table for NYE.
Arrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.
11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation, sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?
11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. 
11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes, a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.
Basically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. 

In the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth, this was the closing: "Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless." BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes, 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. 

Big name DJs? Yes
Bottle Service & VIP? Yes
Huge areas to move around? Yes... however, during the high tourist months, they pack them in. Also, if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. 
Great sound system? Yes
Fun lights and confetti? Yes
**Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with in any club around the world. TRIPLE YES.**

If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL.

 I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. 

It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.

We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.

Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.

The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.

Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.

Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, "Happy Birthday". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.

If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.

I dig Nosh & Swig. They had me from the second I walked through the door and they were playing Tupac. The vibe and the food are just too cool to pass up. Food porn that tastes as good as it looks.

NOSH- You all I know I can nosh. 
Beef Lumpia-Wonton thing. Delish. Served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce and garnished with green onions. Not on the menu, but if you are lucky it just might be a Chef Special that day. 

Pretzel Brat $8- You REALLY need to order these. Chicken sausage, sauerkraut, cheese gravy on pretzel roll. I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this and I don't usually get down on kraut. Everything works with this and it came on two separate rolls which was perfect for sharing.

Monte Cristo $7- ORDER THIS. My favorite dish here. The mellow melted goodness of the Gruyere complimented the smokiness of the Black Forest ham. But it doesn't end there. It's then topped with a perfectly fried egg and warm berry compote. Hot damn I loved this. 

Truffled Tots- ORDER THESE The best tater tots I have ever tasted. They were creamy, yet crisp on the outside and topped with shredded cheese. Every bite tasted of truffle and made me wish my friend I was dining with was allergic to potato so I could eat every single one of them. No such luck. We both battled it out for the last tater. You won't be disappointed with these and if you are well we probably wouldn't be friends anyways and your mutha's a whore.

Cock-A-Waffle-Doo $10- This was good, real good in fact. My only problem and it's a total personal one because I'm not perfect is it was dark meat. I don't enjoy dark meat chicken, yet it was crispy, flavorful and worked well with the sweet Belgium waffle and Berry Maple reduction. P.S. I could drink the reduction all by itself. 

Spicy Edamame $2- Small portion, but not short in flavor. GET THIS, TOO. We destroyed this and loved the sauce so much we were dipping the tots in it. 

SWIG- I slurped up the Chata-Effup which was a-okay. I am still excited for them to get their liquor license because I know they will have some crazy good cocktails.

Prices are cheap for the creative delicious dishes this place is bangin' out. Great place for sharing plates in a casual environment. The service was on point and friendly. These are good people executing great food and I can't wait to bring everyone I know back to grub and rap with me! IT WAS ALL A DREAM. I USE TO READ.....

The fanciest Afternoon Tea i've had so far!

Awesome view-= can see the strip from the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel near the Aria and Vdara Hotels. 
We came to our reservation a bit early and luckily being the first ones there, we got the best seat in the house, on a couch right in front of the windows! The lounge is not very big and it's right next to the check in desk lobby, so it's not a ideal place to come with a big group. 

Three of us got the Classic English Afternoon tea set at $36.00. 
Tea service is daily 2-5pm. 

You get a choice of tea, 4 tea sandwiches (smoked salmon, egg salad, curried chicken salad sandwich, and black forest ham), 2 small scones served with a very thick cream cheese like Devonshire Cream, pineapple marmalade and strawberry jam, and a selection of petit desserts.

Presentation was superb. Although everything was petit, i thought it was very filling. The sandwiches were yummy. (They are flexible with the sandwiches if you have food restrictions). I didn't love the salmon one, as it had a strong herby flavor. 

The teas were my least favorite. From the last 4-5 afternoon tea experiences, I have loved my tropical black tea choices. When i saw mandarin orange black tea, i was excited. However, when i drank it, it has a strong chinese herbal flavor to it, which i wasn't expecting and kind of clashed with the sweet desserts and sandwiches in my taste... We tried the monkey picked oolong and white tea, and none of them really had us craving to have more. 

Despite not loving the tea flavors, the experience was great and we enjoyed the view. The lounge itself is pretty gorgeous with all the colors. Check it:

Monte Carlo is an affordable hotel in near the center of the Las Vegas Strip.  This hotel had been renovation few years ago, pump the hotel class from 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars.  It located north of New York New York and next to Aria.  

Parking structure is easy in this hotel; you can easily access to the self-parking lot and can walk to the hotel in few minutes of walk. The parking escalator was fill with cigarette smell; I did not bother going back then.

The hotel room elevator is located across the lobby, the nice thing you do not need walks by the casino.  The room's elevators are separate by three different floors level.  That was good-crowed control. Our group came just right before the standard check in time 3pm in Sunday.  There has was about 20 peoples in the line, took about half hours before it was our turn.  The clerk was helpful and we were able to get a high floor level as we request.  The view was the city center (Aria, Vdara and the pool) It was good view despite this just a basic room.  At top of that our 2 booked room were together and also in a corner.  You would always wanted corner room if want peace in Zzz.

The room is modern; there is a big 42-inch flat screen.  However, sadly the channel were not in HD, make it look worse than SD.  One of the room amenities included 2 K-Cup Coffee Pack and two water bottles.  Those were included with the resort fee, which cost almost $23. I wish there is Wi-Fi in the room, only wired is available.  To use Wi-Fi has to go down to lounge level. The room was clean and everything was functional.  The bed and the pillow were very soft, perhaps more than the way I like it.  I had trouble sleep with the bed had to take another night to get used to it.

Their casino floor is modern as well; I was impress with their sport betting room.  Look more modern than five star hotel like Wynn.  The smell of the cigarette is not strong in the casino floor, unlike some other casino I been to.  There is free tram access to Crystal Center, Aria, and Bellagio. wish it also link the tram to Excalibur, so it can access to the southern strip.

Overall, this is good hotel consider the price.  You are only paying half or one third cost of nearby 4 or 5 stars hotel.  While is still in a decent near center strip location.  This hotel can be good choice for family or those who want some peace after some crazy night in club and other activities.

A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  

We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   

I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.

I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!

I used to go across the street to Grimaldi's, completely oblivious to Novecento's existence, but now that my eyes have been opened thanks to the check-in prowess of my Yelpers, this has become my top choice of pizza spots.
Let's begin with the easy, no-nonsense approach to ordering, much like you would a typical phone-in pizzeria you can select whatever toppings you desire on a base pizza you like...we like the Margherita Pizza...marinara, fresh mozarella, fresh basil, grated cheese, and EVO...AND we add fresh garlic and fresh ricotta cheese. Yes, everything is FRESH! The assembly line style ordering starts with hand stretched dough, then goes to toppings which are thoughtfully dotted on your pizza. Be sure to ask them to brush the fresh garlic oil on first, it makes it. Then the crust gets seasoned before it goes into the bright red HOT oven that bakes your pizza in 90 seconds!  At that speed why would anyone pay MORE and wait longer for average delivery pizza?
We also love getting either a burrata or caprese salad with our pizza. I can't seem to find burrata in most Italian restaurants, now I can get it at my local pizza joint! Oh happy day! 
The pizza has a nice chewy thin crust with bubbled charred areas, sauce is light and a little bit wet (but I don't mind) the cheese is perfectly melted and doesn't have that pool of grease from processed cheeses. We usually share a regular pizza between the 2 of us but you can eat an entire pizza and not feel that bad because it is so light. I wouldn't wait too long to eat your pizza because it does get soggy from the sauce.
The burrata is very creamy and rich, and it does fill you up a little. The other times, we opt for the caprese salad which is much lighter. 5 simple ingredients mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic and EVO...delicious.
Now I'm accustomed to paying a bit of a premium for a pizza and salad at Grimaldi's, but at Novecento's our bill for a salad and pizza is usually around $20...what a deal and we don't have to worry about taking home leftover pizza and the whole car reaking of garlic.

The buffet at the Wynn didn't excite me as much as I wanted.  I went there for lunch after reading the list of food selections posted on a sign at the entrance.  Everything seemed to sound better than it tasted, and nothing really stood out as spectacular or memorable.

I started out pretty lightly taking just three items (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=5jI7M5Be86FJFVm9Aeis-g), and I only enjoyed one.  That's approximately what I experienced throughout the meal, for every one item I liked there were always two that I didn't like.  The Kobe beef slider looked great, but the patty was ice cold when I bit into it.  The potstickers had big chunks of inedible pork fat.  The roasted strip loin was very good.  The slice I had was slightly overcooked for my preference, but it was tender, juicy and had good beef flavor.

The beef flank steak was also good.  Sliced thick with a sweet marinade, most of the cuts were overcooked by sitting under the heat lamp, but it had good flavor.  I love fish, but the fish here was awful.  The sea bass was not fresh and crumbled instead of flaked.  The grilled salmon was only partially cooked as I could see and taste the frozen core within.  The red snapper tasted bland.

I did find a pasta dish to my liking.  The Pappadella had flat noodles in a creamy tomato sauce and was laden with big chunks of shrimp.  On the other hand the lump crab mac 'n' cheese was creamy and cheesy but what little crab meat was already picked off.  The pizza tasted like crap I can buy at Sbarro and the sushi simply isn't worth mentioning.  I tried more than half of what was offered, and when nothing really wowed me I moved along to the desserts.

The decadent Oreo Mousse Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=-fSEZvHdYCxfipPsAjtONg) was very chocolately, very rich and very sweet even for my chocoholic taste.  I love mint and I tried the Mint Chocolate Mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=xtPuLkTf4GfltHy12Mpsow).  The mint mousse was thick and gummy, but the bottom layer of chocolate cake was very moist.  It was very much like eating toothpaste on top of chocolate cake!

The Blueberry Tart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cExiCHnu3lfOCwVZwt7EQ) was good.  It was very light and not too sweet with a citrus mousse on top of thin shortbread and a light film of blueberry jam in between.  I liked the Tapioca Pearl Mousse with Mango and Lychee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cnd5txt44wiE2US_S8oUw) also.  Soft mini tapioca balls are folded into a light mousse and layered over a mango flavored gelatin with a strip of lychee fruit inside.  I liked the Lime Mousse with Raspberry Gelle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=wPy6KDF48APMGm3faAecJw) also, but more so because it was tart.  There is a small piece of sponge cake sandwiched in between the tart lime mousse and the sour raspberry gelatin.

If the only differences between lunch and dinner are the price and the frozen crab legs I think I'll pass on The Buffet at The Wynn.

After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say "I'll......have......this.".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. 

With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. 

It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. 

Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!

The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.

The table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!

Can we say over hyped? Being a Las Vegas Local, may seem like I am being biased or sensitive on reviews, but just being at SLS will speak for it self. They spent so much money on advertising, hyping up the new resort by renovating a classic landmark casino in which was once called Sahara hotel.  Sadly with all the renovations or what has become, it sadly failed to deliver in giving honor to a classic Vegas time piece and destination.  Times have changed and obviously what goes up, must come down...but what gets rebuilt shouldn't always be the case.  This is what you get when you come to the SLS. 

Owned by SBE entertainment and known for their posh boutique luxury style and offering...the SLS is anything but that.  In the capital city of entertainment destination around the world, the kind of grand opening that the SLS delivered was more of a 99 cents store opening up at a local ghetto. (With all due respect...I do shop at 99 cents store) but to get to the point of their grand opening is that, why open up shop when you are not ready?!?  

Their carpets were all filled with wood and construction debris, the concrete pavement which was painted white were full of grease marks and over spray and was rather unpleasant. It reminded me of walking into  a model home being constructed.  

Now the concept is nice and in some cases, some decor was actually modern and intriguing but it leaves you with a feeling of emptiness and questions yourself..."that's it?!?"  I'm not sure what the interior decorator or designer was going through but in my opinion and point of view, as if they were going for a mix of modern and vintage at the same time, rather than being contemporary.  There was too much going on yet too little of it going on. (Confusing right?...that's what it is confusing!)

We all know casinos don't have windows and clocks for a reason, but the ambience is pretty dark and gothic like. Lighting was a fail...common this is Vegas...not a Seattle grunge night club. It may be good for those who rock ED Hardy or are into twilight (no offense again I've watched the whole twilight series) but check out the ceilings. It looks like you are entering a consignment warehouse. Even with SLS being crowded due to grand opening, I managed to walk the whole casino floor premises in a boring 15 minutes. 

SLS does offer some interesting restaurants and clubs but nothing on par with what MGM/WYNN offers in house.  Prices on some of the upscale restaurants are not worth paying (unless you have cash to blow and don't give a $&@!) I'd rather take my business elsewhere. 

And what's up with the parking lot/valet/taxi staging area/entrance? Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles could design a much better traffic flowing concept. This parking concept is literally an accident waiting to happen. My advice is be careful if you plan to visit and park. I suggest parking yourself instead if valet at least until they get their stuff together and that's if they do.  

I really do hope SLS succeeds.  This is my city and I would hate failure to happen, but the way it is going now does not look good.  They need to step it up, otherwise they will lose customers, especially locals. Sahara Hotel was actually more better and even had a nascar cafe with roller coaster. I just hope this isn't the end of it, otherwise it will be the end of it. SLS until you can provide a cleaner, more attractive and on par resort...I won't be coming back anytime soon. For that matter, I may not come back at all. 

1 star rating does not even do justice. If I could this rating would be negative.  So sad.

Graceland Wedding Chapel was the perfect venue for our wedding & our experience was indeed one to be remembered for a lifetime....

So why 2-Stars & not 5?  Because we felt extremely rushed from the moment we were picked up & we didn't have nearly enough time w/ Elvis.  The last straw came from the absolute EXTORTION they try to charge for photos

I will say they set expectations that the ceremony would last about 15 min...however, I thought that meant the actual "ceremony" part was 15 min & we would have more time allotted for taking pictures or having our quality-Elvis time.....especially after we PAID OVER $600 ( and this was BEFORE tips )

Soon as we got there, they were wrapping up a ceremony & were already ready for us - there were 3 people behind the counter w/ each person talking to a different person in our party & it was very chaotic....couldn't keep up w/ all the conversations, except that someone was asking for a credit card.  

Literally as the credit card was being placed back in our wallet, we're walking down the aisle & the vows are being completed.  There was no opportunity to make sure my dress was appropriately fluffy, or even sitting center, my hair was still in place, if I had lipstick smeared across my face - nothing!

Then the photographer doesn't even give us a moment to breathe or let anything sink in as he's directing us to hurry up, stand here, stand there, hurry up, hold the flowers, look at each other, hurry up.  Elvis comes over to stand in a few shots then we're handed the tip-envelopes & it's all over & we're like, wait!  What just happened?!

And I can absolutely confirm the entire experience ( ceremony * plus * pics ) lasted 12 min b/c of the timestamps on our photo package - which began the moment they shut the door to the moment the final pic was taken & we were shown the exit.  Let me repeat - TWELVE MINUTES

If I'd known the *real* timetable, I'd have purchased 2 of the cheaper ceremonies & had more Elvis time for less money b/c yeah, it was THAT important to me

Heck, it would have been nice to have had even 5 extra minutes for an opportunity to take a few photos the way *we* would have liked to take them either w/ each other or especially w/ Elvis....after all, this was the whole reason we had chosen Graceland.....and especially after the amount of money we paid

I certainly appreciated them knowing the routine well enough to know all the best places to stand & the best poses but our limo driver spent more time w/ us than the "professional photographer" or Elvis did, if that tells you anything

And speaking of pictures, as there are no "outside" cameras allowed, you're held hostage.....packages include a DVD of the ceremony but do NOT include pics.  We received an $80 credit towards ordering *printed* photos - but charging $5.95 for 1 printed 4x6 copy is ridiculous!  I can get them printed at Walgreens myself for $0.15!!!  And if you'd like the jpegs?  Be ready to cough up TEN DOLLARS PER JPEG b/c they've disabled any way to download them yourself....and at more than 100 pics, we're talking over $1000?  Are you ** serious  ** ?!

So have to say we were fans of the overall concept but I think the jury is still out on the experience....because I really can't remember any of it & for the money we paid, there should have been additional chapel-time, more time w/ Elvis, & digital pics included

Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.

I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).

I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium ("red in the center"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g

For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)

I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. And no, I don't mean great value. I mean it's obvious how many corners they cut with this place. I love the sls in BH and this place feels like a budget motel in comparison. 

We paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a "lux corner suite" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress, thin sandpaper sheets, cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners, which, oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst "luxury" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. 

Not to mention, right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No, we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. 

The finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already, but given that I love the sls BH, I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they "already told me so."


Update: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total, $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as "gratuity".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.

Even asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering.

YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 "Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the "Caliente Burger Combo" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a "Chili Tamale" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories. Thank You Tommy's for branching out of California and making your presence in Nevada!

Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red dcor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  

There's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sauted brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 "Grand Seafood Plateau".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  

All the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  

I was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  

The staff raved about the "Envy Signature Sea Bass" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their "Grilled Pesto Prawns" and "Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a "steakhouse" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       

They would be a clear nominee if there were ever a "Best of LV" category for "Steakhouse for people that don't like steak".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!

Consider this Sunday Brunch buffet the Godfather to all buffets in the Valley. If you're like me, you won't quite realize what you're getting yourself into until you've been seated and you make your way into the buffet room. Yes, I said buffet room and I mean that it's an entire room dedicated to the buffet. Here's how it works: you stand in line to enter the restaurant, you pay upfront, you're seated by a hostess and then the feeding frenzy begins. 

Once we were seated, we took a moment to take in our surroundings. I looked to my left, I looked to my right and everywhere I looked, people had food piled (and I mean piled) high on their plates. Had they eaten in weeks or had they just eaten last night? It's hard to tell, but really, it's also hard to blame the gorging-like behavior because the second you see this buffet, an animal instinct triggers in your body and you must attack the buffet as if it is your last meal on this earth. People piled entire meat shops on their plates and then topped it off with heaps of fried Chinese food, cheesy Mexican food, Seafood glory and any pastry, dessert or breakfast dish imaginable. 

For the amount of traffic this buffet gets, the staff, service and structure is spot-on and even with just one person working the register, we got through the initial line pretty quickly. Once we were inside, we were let loose to discover the culinary creations on our own. The buffet room is clean, stocked high with food and organized in a structured way. People pile the food high on their plates and this results in the food disappearing off the serving platters faster than the chef's can put it down. But the chef's aren't phased and keep cooking as fast as they can. There is every type of food imaginable and there's no possible way a human could enjoy everything this buffet has to offer. But it's definitely worth a shot. 

The Sunday Brunch Buffet is $26 for adults but it's absolutely worth it. I was told it's pricier because it's a seafood buffet. It's not your 5 star resort "stuffy" brunch but rather a nice quality casual buffet and probably the nicest one Phoenix has to offer for this price range and quantity. I will be back soon to try out the $9.99 buffet they offer on Saturdays. 

This is absolutely the buffet to check-out in Phoenix. You'll walk away as in awe as I am.

Well My Friend, this is a great place to dine at.  It was our last night in Vegas and wanted to dine someplace where we could people watch on the strip.  So after trying to decide between 2 places we went with Mon Ami Gabi.  Since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  

We were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter Scott.  He was all smiles kinda reminded me of Marc Anthony.  Very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.

Started off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  

Sea scallops gratinees ~ was broiled to yummygoodness I could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  

Mussels Mariniere ~ Cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  They were very good.  

Scallop potato and green beans that came with the Prime rib was very addicting.  The scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. 

Prime Rib ~ This was one huge honker of a prime rib.  Cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  It was juicy and tender.  Mmmm Meat!

Skate Wing ~ One thing I always order when its on the menu.  If you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  Its sooo damn good.  I could have eaten 2 of these things.  Its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  

After pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.

Bananas Foster Crepe ~ It wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in New Orleans but it had the right flavor.  It was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in Vegas.

Eyes ~ Great place to people watch and catch the show of the Bellagio fountains.
Nose ~ Smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!
Ear ~ Its a typical dinner time vibe!
Mouth ~ Really tasty good stuff!
Tummy ~ Everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!

I've never been to a spa before. I'll do a quick review of the place itself first and then explain my experience for anyone who cares.

All I have to say is that I don't really understand the concept of a spa like this lol but it was still enjoyable.

So basically the place has different rooms to relax in with varying heat levels.

It's $20 for all day admission.

It's all about relaxing and distressing your body in a clean and calm area.

There is a restaurant, a few different Sauna rooms, place to watch tv, and even a place to exercise. There is a fully stocked hygiene type area with shampoo, lotion, and hair products, for getting ready. 

Aside from those amenities you can get massages at an additional cost.

Overall it's super clean. The staff is super nice. And the place is large. 


So if you want a place to go to to just lounge around and relax for a few hours then I'd say to check this place out. 

Okay so here's how it works! I feel like saying this because I had no idea "what to do here" so hopefully this helps those first timers.

There are two floors. The bottom is gender specific and the upstairs is for both.

After you pay you are given a wrist band. This is used to open your locker and also to charge your food or drinks since you pay when you leave.

You enter through a a male or female side, put your shoes away in the shoe locker, then you are at a locker room area. There are TV's and chairs to watch TV away from the women and is where you out your stuff. 

In the men's side there are a bunch of showers. Sitting showers, standing, cold or hot. Then a big "hot tub" type pool and a cold one, and then 4 saunas. There's a dry sauna, two steam saunas, and another dry heat type sauna room. I don't dig saunas so I don't really have an opinion on these.

Oh yea! Everyone is basically nude down here so don't be bashful. I was a bit apprehensive at first but you really have to get over it to enjoy yourself.

Basically the only time you HAVE TO be fully nude is to enter the pools. It's all about hygiene so you shower nude and then get in the poop nude. This was really actually one of the more relaxing things.

Can't say much about the saunas.

Anyways upstairs!

Then upstairs you must wear the little outfit they provide which include shirt, shorts, and sandals.

There's two TV areas, a restaurant that also serves smoothies and teas, an exercise room, the private Massage rooms, a yoga area, and the "saunas. 

The restaurant seems expensive but hey if the food is good who cares. 

The rooms are all different in what material they are made out of and how hot they are. I honestly hate being hot so my favorite parts weren't related to the saunas so much.

The stand out rooms were the ice room and the red clay room.

The red clay room has these small red clay balls that you lay in and also these clear rocks that you can lay in. I preferred the balls and this was our favorite room. The balls felt very therapeutic when you lay on them or stepped on them

The idea is to just lay there and relax but the whole process of getting into a pit with tiny clay balls is really loud.

The second favorite room for me was the ice room. It's a freezing cold room. My cup of tea for the hangover I was having.

You use these sauna rooms for 3-7 minutes, drink some water, and relax for 30 minutes and try out the other rooms. I'm not sure the purpose of each room but basically whatever floats your boat then go to the room!

That's basically it. Idk if I'd go again but it was cool to experience. Maybe if there were different explanations to the rooms and their therapeutic benefits then I'd have been more into it but sitting in hot rooms isn't my thing. 

If you do it the right way there are about 5 of those dry sauna rooms so in 45 minute cycles you could easily spend a few hours here.

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***

Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.

In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).

I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:

(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).

(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.

(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.

The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.

(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.

(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.

(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.

The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.

(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).

The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).

(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.

There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.

In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).

For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.

Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.

Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).

AUTOMATIC SHADES

When I found out our work group was staying here I was so happy. My room was amazing and the view was breathtaking. But what brought me the most joy was laying in bed and opening and closing the automatic shades and curtains. Honestly I could lay there all day and have a blast. I guess it's the little things that make me happy. In all of my world travels that is one feature I have never really seen in a hotel. 

Steve Wynn spares no expense and everything is top notch in any of his properties. He understands his customers are willing to pay for the good life. Steve provides that good life here. He plays videos on the in-room TV where he describes the hotel. After 4 days of non-stop talking in the dry weather my voice starts to sound like Steve Wynn. I crack up all my co-workers with doing hilarious versions of Steve's TV speeches. I love Vegas for laughs with co-workers. 

This hotel is amazing but expensive too. The room is great. It is so luxurious I want to stay here all of the time. The bathroom is huge too. I enjoy the amazing views of the mountains and it's such a great sight to see when I wake up. 

The hotel has some restaurants inside. There is one we always go too but that's because you can get a bag of hot donuts after dinner. Those things are so good. There's also a nightclub but I've never been to it. Work seems to always get in the way of business trips. Damn work. 

I do use the gym/spa though. It is a little expensive at $20 a day but I need to get my workout in. I will work in breakfast there too with some fresh fruit and a coffee. So it kind of works out because it might actually cost me $20 to just order that food for breakfast. My mornings are not complete until I've gotten my six mile run in.  So as unhealthy as Vegas can be between the amount of food and late nights this gym puts me right back on my healthy track. Which is derailed by the end of every evening...ha!!!

So if you're looking for a great place to stay in Vegas then this is the place to stay. It will make you feel like a king. I wish I could spend more time hanging here then actually working off-site. They use to have a free shuttle through the golf course to the convention center. That was the best but it's now gone. It made my work day so easy. Now I have to take the scary convention bus in traffic or a taxi to get to the show. Steve if your listening bring the bus back!!!

You can't buy happiness but you can buy ramen and sushi and that's kind of the same thing.

Le grr.  I was hoping to start the new year off with a 5-star worthy meal!  At least it's not as bad as the Japanese-Mexican fusion place I went to earlier this week.  Yikes.  Anyways, met up with the in-laws today to celebrate my sister-in-law's milestone birthday.  I have never been here before so I jumped onto Yelp last night to see what would catch my eye.  Since it's been pretty chilly due to the winter storm, I was leaning towards ramen.  It ended up being a safe choice after seeing and tasting a little bit of what everyone ordered.

I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen with the Deluxe Dragon Roll on the side.  My ramen came with either salad or edamame and three California rolls.  I should have checked the tips on Yelp because I chose the edamame thinking the warm soybeans would help warm me up as we were seated under the only ceiling fan that appeared to be running.  It was cold and old and I ended up sliding it over the Mr. W. who had a very gross salad.  The California rolls are basic so it's nothing to write home about.  The ramen was satisfying.  Although the noodles seem to be the store-bought variety, I enjoyed the flavor of the miso broth immensely.  Paired with the butter that made the soup base creamy and coat my mouth with a wonderfully richness, I was pretty happy --- even with the hard-boiled egg [I was hoping for a soft-boiled egg].  I wish they had corn instead of bamboo shoots in their ramen but that's just all personal preference.  The chashu in my ramen was also nothing special.  The Deluxe Dragon Roll is a fancified dragon roll with the addition of cream cheese and tempura shrimp.  I also got to try some sashimi that didn't seem all too fresh, a cold lovely-dressed jellyfish salad, and other little bites.

Service was a little lacking but it's understandable since it was super busy.  It was a full-restaurant for the two hours we were there.  If I ever stop in again, I think I want to try their udon.

The Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas. The Venetian for those of you who may not know, is a very beautiful resort. There are beautiful interior features and rooms, a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone, from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me, I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere. 

I came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated, the waitress took our drink orders, customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you, it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it, served halved, crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions, applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday, but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner, I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now, it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside, but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are, the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert, well, there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas, I shall return next trip!

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

I have had this place on my Yelp bookmarks ever since this place opened up in Vegas about 9 months ago. I finally got to try it recently!

Walking in the place is a small and quaint. There are roughly less than 10 tables and they put together a couple for our party of 7. When we first got there, we stood at the front for a couple minutes because there was no host to greet us or seat us. It turns out only one guy was working that day. He actually turned out to be a pretty pleasant and nice server. I unfortunately did not catch his name but he was a young Filipino guy who was very accommodating and friendly).

This place is not a turo-turo where items are already cooked and you just choose. Each dish is freshly prepared and cooked after you order.

We ordered the following:
Chop suey (mixed vegetables): $7.99 (on the special menu that day)
Caldereta (beef dish): $11.99 (on the special menu that day)
Sugpa liempo (pork belly slices): $12.99 (family size) 
Pancit bam-i (noodles): $9.99 (family size) 
Boneless bangus (milkfish): $12.99
Ngo-Yong (egg roll): free with yelp check-in

Each dish came with 1 scoop of rice

Although we ordered the family size portions, many of the dishes could also be ordered solo size for a smaller portion.

From what we ordered, taste wise I liked the Ngo-Yong eggroll (crispy and delicious), sugpa liempo (flavorful and tender pork belly) and the pancit-bami (good mix of noodles). 

Portion wise some dishes like the Caldereta and the chop suey were small. I thought these were a little pricey for what we got. I also wished the Ngo-Yong egg roll was bigger. It was small and I left wanting more of it because it was that good! The best value were the pancit bam-i and sugpa liempo.

One thing to note when paying is that for parties of 6 or more they add 18% gratuity automatically to your meal.

Overall, I really enjoyed the food here! It was delicious! That Ngo-Yong egg roll is my new favorite. I am very happy to have another place for authentic Filipino eats in Vegas!

I've had my hair done by the infamous Kim Vo & I don't consider myself fortunate. You couldn't pay me to go back to him. I gave him two chances but he lost me as a client! Not that he cares because Kim is some "big shot" hairdresser (allegedly). But please allow me to explain because YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT GO HERE!

I thought Kim was a nice guy, so it sucks to have to write this, but this is about hair here & I make my money partially based upon how I look. The results of his work has messed with my livelihood & I'm not happy about it! In short, Kim majorly screwed my hair up & this isn't some isolated incident. I'm completely baffled as to why Kim is a so called "celebrity hairdresser" yet THIS doesn't seem to be common knowledge:

"Kim Vo Firestarter" it's appropriately titled... http://gomezhyatt.com/2010-03-22-kim-vo-firestarter/

I wish I'd read all this BEFORE I went to him because if I had, I would have never let him come within 50 ft of my hair! The whole reason why I went to him was his BS marketing about how he's the "best blonder in the business" & how his blonde techniques are actually healthy for your hair. And I'm embarrassed to say that he caught me with his marketing hook, line and sinker. His PR company must be GOOD at burying info because it turns out that Kim is actually also famous for allegedly burning people & frying people's hair off. You can google all of this info yourself or you will hear it from time to time on Chelsea Lately, as apparently he fried her hair hair off too. Luckily I wasn't burned but I had to cut ties because Kim Vo left my hair in the worst shape that it has ever been in my life after only two visits with him. 

Kim does a GREAT job alright... at packing on the clients like an assembly line! The first time I saw him I was amazed at how fast he works. I was happy with my color but I did notice some tiger striping which was also pointed out to me every time I had a blowout. I think "Who did you hair?!" were the exact words my stylist said when she looked at all the bleeding from the foils in the back section that I was unable to see. But stupid me ignored these warning signs & I somehow thought perhaps it was my fault & that maybe I had tapped the foils by accident while under the dryer. And Kim had me roped in with his lil used car salespitch about how I have to give him a good four visits for my hair to be where it should be. So back I went for time #2 at his salon in Vegas at The Palms. I had been noticing that my hair was sticking up straight every morning like I had been sticking my finger in a light socket so I said something to Kim about it thinking that maybe I should cut my hair even shorter because it was obviously still damaged. Kim talked me out of it though. He related a story about how he was having the same issues with his own hair that morning & that it was sticking up because our hair was short & that we didn't have the weight of it being long to weigh it down. His explanation quieted my concerns & I entrusted him with my hair again. After this visit, my hair condition got even worse & then it finally hit me that HE was the one who was messing my hair up! That's when I started reflecting, & think about it, if he can't even get his own hair right, that is NOT a good sign! And the other thing is that I've had short hair before & I never had issues with my hair sticking up straight like it did under his care. So yeah, the length of my hair was not the problem. It was Kim Vo that was the problem. And let me just say, he is FIRED & officially off my Xmas card list! He's actually lucky I'm not waiting for him in a dark alley to show him my wrestling moves & brass knuckle phone case demonstration, LOL!

And now that I'm done with him, it's crazy how many horror stories I've heard about Mr. Vo which lead me to the articles/shows talking about how he (allegedly) burns people & fries hair. And I also heard that he uses some really hardcore bleach on everyone's hair because when he does his little assembly line action it allows him to lift the hair quicker which means mo clients + mo money = win for him. So if these things are true, then to Kim, you are really nothing more than a dollar sign & that pisses me off. The guy doesn't give a flying F#$K about your hair's health & I had to get back on the extension train & spend a lot of $$ to fix what he did. I just wish someone had said something on Yelp &/or this info wasn't buried by PR campaigns because I definitely would have thought twice about going to him. I'm pissed I drove all the way to Beverly Hills to see him the first time & paid a fortune x2, only to have my hair ruined! So that's my story. Maybe you won't have to fry your hair off or ruin it like he's done to me & others (allegedly). It's really a shame because I wanted to like Kim! I just got sucked in to all the hype. If I can save one person from my fate, this review will have been worth it.

"Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights"

I know this song is a little old, but I hope you get the picture.  I heard good things from my Vegas promoter friends at Galavantier, but not so good things from a personal friend, so I said WTH!!!  I am always game to check out a new club in Vegas!!!

Light is located towards the rear of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  I believe there used to be another club here, but I forget the name because I rarely venture away from the strip (Mandalay is pretty far south for me!).  We bypassed GP (general population) via Galavantier (please see my review).  It was well worth the extra $.  We heard peeps wait 3 hours to get in this club.  FTS!!! (F*ck That $hit!!!).

Krewella was playing the Fri night we went, and the standard Cirque du Soleil show was entertaining.  However, not as entertaining as the talent!!!  There were many fine looking ladies that my friend and I would have loved to meet given the opportunity.  We had nearly given up when we met a pair of Azn ladies at the bar.  I don't usually talk to Azn ladies much (primarily because they rarely talk to me, and I had a bad experience recently w/ two Azn ladies:  They were the wrong kinda F's:  Fliar [F*cking Liar] & a Flake [Fulla Lame A$$ Kine Excuses]).  But these Azn ladies were the right kinda F's:   Fwhiiiiine, Friendly & Fun!!!  The one I liked had a shoulder piece tattoo and I complimented her on her artwork.  She asked me if I had any work, so I showed her a pic of my shoulder piece, half sleeve and chest plate.  She liked my work so much that she asked me to open up my buttons to see.  I am not usually an exhibitionist, but we weren't getting any love so I threw caution to the wind and said OK!!!  At this point in time I was waiting for her to tell me she was a pro, and she cost $$$ much, but it never happened.  Turns out these women were the good kind of pros:  "Professionals" just like us, who love to party and to top it off they were from LA!!!

We spent the rest of the evening with these ladies because they were not ratchets (we bought each other drinks at their insistence), and they could carry on intelligent conversations.  Afterwards, we grabbed an early morning breakfast.  Lastly, we also agreed to meet up in LA soon.  I guess I should stop being so judgmental of Azn ladies.  These hawt Azn ladies helped me see the "Light"! - LMAO!!!

RigaTonys why do I keep forgetting about you!!

A friend that I hadn't seen in about 22 years was driving though and hit me up on FB and said Hey lets have dinner, find somewhere off the I-10 and make it Italian and RigaTony's was the perfect place to pick! 

We meet up around 5pm on a Wednesday night, the place was busy, but not packed, I was loving how they decorated for Christmas, made me feel like I was going to a party :) 

Our server was Michelle and she was very helpful answering whatever questions my friends had, and she was excellent at making sure we had everything we needed, love great service

After we checked out the menu I decided I wanted the lasagna & spaghetti combo. My friend ordered the chicken with lemon & artichoke and her husband ordered the spaghetti deluxe.

Then the antipasto salad & freshly baked ciabatta bread came out, OMG this salad is to die for, I love love love it!! Stop going to the Olive Garden people, this is the salad you should be having!! And the bread!! I love me some fresh baked bread, so much better than sticks! 

My lasagna was delish baby! It was so flavorful too, the cheese, the noodles the sauce, omg I can't believe I ate it all, I ordered it with the intention of having some for lunch the next day, nope that didn't happen!  So good!!  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect amount and great in flavor! Loved the combo! 

My friends, they too loved their dishes and were happy we picked RiggaTonys for dinner!! It was great seeing her and sharing a great meal too! 

A fun tip I did learn about RiggaTonys is once a month on Monday night they have a Wine dinner, where you dine on 5 course dinner that the Chef prepares for just that night; I will have to check that out soon!

Happy Hour Review:

We came for the Tempe Arts Fair,http://www.yelp.com/biz/tempe-arts-festival-tempe#hrid:mFf-pIdZ8gGArDYHL4-YgA  but decided to checkout the Happy Hour at La Bocca.  For the last three years, this restaurant and it's Chef Julian Wright is all anyone can talk about.  It feels like Phoenix's New Times writes about him at least once a week. LOL 

AMBIANCE:
Mill Avenue continues to change with the times and reinvent itself -- something we like!  We chose to sit outside and people watch since it was still early.  Inside the restaurant has a modern 1940s feel which is really very nice.

CLIENTELE:
Here's an interesting category.  Mill Avenue and the restaurants are a mixture of older college kids from ASU (21+), along with Alumni of all ages.  You also have people like us who just like the vibe of the area.

MENU:
They've made some changes in their Happy Hour menu, but everything is still excellent! Most items from the bar are $3.00 during HH, that also includes shots.  So it really is a watering hole. We really like their Rojo Sangria, and it's a very reasonable at $22.00 for a 750 ml Carafe, btw.
http://laboccapizzeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-WINTER-WINE-LIST.pdf

SERVICE:
Is a tag team affair, but our server Alex was outstanding.  He stayed on top of things and came back to check in from time to time.  When we mentioned Yelp, he told us how customers have written some very nice reviews about the restaurant and one had even mentioned his service.  Well Alex, here's your second nod.  You were great, and we would come back to your section anytime! 

FOOD:
The food at LaBocca is mostly Italian with some tweaks to the concept.  A good example is their Harvest Chop Salad for $8.00 which we enjoyed.  There's a nominal $2.00 up-charge for the split, but it was subtle and very nice. It had a light Dijon mustard vinaigrette dressing, over tubetti pasta, romaine lettuce, bacon, tomatoes and some blue cheese.  It was delicious and the blue cheese was very mild, almost Gorgonzola-ish.  

Next we had their famous Margarita pizza was $9.00 (see photo). La Bocca is known for their pizzas. It was made with some crushed San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella.  It also had a rough cut of basil leaves on top.  We liked it a lot, but also enjoy the pizza at Pomo's on Scottsdale Road for the real Neopolitan stuff. 

For dessert we shared each others -- Tiramisu $ 5.00 (photo) and Fresh Mint Chip Ice Cream $6.00.  A nice ending to a wonderful meal.
http://laboccapizzeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/labocca-urban-pizzeria-lunch-dinner-menu.pdf

PRICES:
Our bill came to $52.00 after taxes, but before gratuities.  It would have been less if we kept to the HH wine list but the carafe of Sangria (photo) was too good to pass up.

Enjoy!  We'll be back.

I guess people do really like them on Yelp!

I walked in with a sore back and legs, walked out with a huge headache and even more sore back and legs.!

I'm going to start this review by the main reason why I only gave them a two stars review. Worse experience ever! 
When our massage was completed, we charged the massage on our credit cards and I was preparing tip money in cash for our two masseuses.. Upon that time, one of the lady, perhaps the owner  saw that I had only pulled out a $5 bill, she screamed out loud in Chinese, "Only $5 for tip!!!" I looked at her and rolled my eyes and regret I didn't say anything! I was in so much pain, I just wanted to get out of there.

I wanted to give Coco who worked on my sister $10 tip, and for the guy who worked on me $5 because I was nice enough to tip on such a horrendous massage!  Instead, I gave $10 each but walked out of there mad as hell! I wished I was more braver to say something back and I don't know what got over me to even tip more! Maybe I just really felt bad for the guy. 

After days of walking and walking from casinos to casinos, my sister and I are exhausted! What was needed was a good massage! Found this place by it's high ratings and by Yelp's recommendations. Called in and book an appointment at 10pm with Coco and Rex. 

Upon our arrival, they took us into a little sectioned out room with two massage chairs. My sister took Coco, and instead of having Rex, they said he had another appointment and swore to me another guy was as good as Rex and they told me not to worry. 

That was the worst massage I'd ever had!! The entire hour was miserable. I wanted to get up in the middle of the massage because it was so bad, but I felt bad because he was a nice guy and I he was new. 
First, he was confused to either have me sit up first or lay on my face first. Coco that was next to us was directing him what to do. He wasn't well trained and didn't really knew where the body pressure points were. He hurt me by massaging too hard on my bone, His massage techniques was just pushing and pinching. He had long nails so every time he used his fingers to massage me, his fingernails pinched my skin. I was so uncomfortable. I didn't get his name, but he was short and chubby, in his early forties, and didn't speak much English.

P.s.~ My sister said Coco's massage was only just OK. Three stars OK.

So this experience had FAILED! ... will never be back again!

My friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.

We were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.

Since the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be "in the money".....aka "get your money's worth".

I was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):

Round 1
Crab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)
Tempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)
Philly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)
Chili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)

Round 2
Small Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)
Jack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)
Nuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)
Octapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)

Round 3
Shorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)
Tuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)

Everything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).

***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.

Over the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!

Will I return?  Hell yeah!  Return Factor - 100%

I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like "creeper fishy" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. 

Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a "Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered "Animal Style Fries" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a "Flying Dutchman" for them and they will thank you :)

I'm giving this place 5 stars. The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea. 
They started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out.  So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner. 

The Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out. 

The meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good. 

This place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around. It was a lot of fun.

Maggiano's can sometimes feel like an endless party. 

I remember working in the Sears Tower when we first heard that Chili's (Brinker Intl') had bought the rights to the concept. In short, we were all bummed and felt they would goof it up. 

Well so much for our misgiving's, they sold off Macaroni Grill and made a decent attempt at allowing a little bit of Chicago's Italian scene to come alive for the rest of the country. 

Now don't get me wrong, this restaurant isn't perfect, as they were this past Friday evening. Yes, the Hostess station still seems confused as Laura M noted in her review last year. But where can you get a good meal for two, including appetizers, drinks and dessert, along with two especially prepared take home entrees for $55?  Really!

So we started with a glass of Merlot ($8.00), Soup ($3.95)and a Sausage appetizer ($8.50 which was a meal in itself, see photos).  For out entrees, we had their Classic Pasta for $12.95 and Mama's Lasagna $14.95.  Both were very good, though the entrees came first and our server's boss was indifferent at best while being distracted with a larger party.  Our server Hannah was outstanding, but so much for our easy going, pre-Christmas romantic meal.

For dessert, we shared two of their petite samplers for $3.50 each and coffee.  Their Apple Cobbler and dark chocolate Truffle balls were delicious and worth the trip.  We highly recommend them.  The regular sized dessert are good, but way over the top in size.

The bill came to $66.16, less a $10.00 off coupon from their email list.  So if we stopped here, it would be a fair $55.37 and not a bad deal, right?  But Maggiano's was still offering their buy two, take two home special. Nice! So we had enough for a second dinner sometime this week.  All and all, a delicious option. 

Enjoy!

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining.

I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)

As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! 

So I ordered a "Vienna All Beef Hot Dog" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a "Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. 

They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.

They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place.

An incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.

(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).

It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  

Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  

For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.

For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!

Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.

Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.

Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.

Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.

Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.

For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.

Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.

Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.

After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. 

We ordered a "Quesadilla" priced at $10 and "Empanadas" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! 

They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.

We arrived at 5:00 pm to check-in and were told by the front desk agent that our room wasn't ready yet and that they couldn't give us an estimate of when it would be. The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us, they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was, we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.

After a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account, we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. 

The front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night, and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50, not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her, she brought in the front desk manager, David Bayley, who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.

After coming back at 5:30, we asked a front desk agent, Kira, if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us, implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually, she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of "good will", but refused to do anything else, telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.

We, of course, were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager, David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint, he came out to tell us, essentially, to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us, and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.

First of all, this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up, then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail, and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of "good will" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time, we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.

Second was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of "good will" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar, treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. 

Finally, the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit, which certainly was the impression we received, good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. 

At the very end, after they finally canceled out our balance, I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David, to his credit, wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira, however, wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - "Kira". No last name, no phone number, no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately, Kira seemed to lack both.

Don't stay at the Cosmo. Your dignity is more important than having a nice view.

If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.

So, I ordered an "Italian Beef Sandwich" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small "Cheddar Cheese Fries" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up.

If you are thinking of trying Mundo for the first time, please read
this. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.
Unfortunately we weren't able to try the food because we were verbally
attacked by the owner, Mingo Collaso, so this review is for the
experience only. Here's what happened.

My husband and I (we are locals) called the restaurant at 3 pm, asking
if they were still serving lunch. The host was very sweet and polite
and said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had a
baby in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.

We arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I had
called, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHER
PERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. We
sat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered a
cocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. The
baby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food on
its way- so far so good.

Then a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, "I
want you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but children
are not allowed in the restaurant." I looked at him with a confused look,
since we had been seated there by the host, and said, "Well, I called
ahead and asked--" and he interrupted me and said, "I don't care. Like
I said, there's nothing I can do about it now." I said, "are you
asking us to leave?" and he responded again, "I don't care."

I asked him, "Why are you treating us this way? Why are you being so
rude?" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and I
pointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant and
we had called and asked. He repeated, "I don't care," and turned on
his heels and stormed OUT of the restaurant.

We were shocked. I have never been treated this badly in a restaurant
in my life. I worked in the service industry for ten years and have
never seen anyone treated like this. We had called ahead about the
baby, arrived when not a single person was there, ordered drinks and
food, and were suddenly attacked by the owner. I felt like I got
punched in the face.

He was obviously mad at his staff for allowing us in and behaved like
a child by taking it out on us. I will strongly advise anyone who
wants a positive service experience to not go to Mundo. The owner is
unprofessional, unkind, and rude. I literally left in tears thanks to him.

Of all the Roberto's locations around Vegas this 'berto's location is one of the more consistent. It's located between Home Depot and Capriotti's. I have been coming here on my lunch break and more recently yesterday after a trip to Home Depot. The inside is clean and the guy at the register who has taken my order each time is friendly and actually goes over your order with you to make sure it's right if you customized anything. Like the other locations in town, you can get your chicken taco fix for only 99 cents on Wednesdays with a limit of 12 per person at that price.

The "Adobada Taco" at a cost of $2.75 each was good. It had marinated pork, guacamole and fresh salsa on it. There was meat falling out of the taco because they weren't stingy with the fillings. One thing I love here is the "Rolled Tacos" that come in different options. You can choose chicken, beef, sour ream, guacamole or just cheese. I don't like their guacamole that much, so I just got the rolled tacos (beef) with cheese. The rolled tacos with cheese cost $2.35 and are easily a meal by itself for me! So darn cheap and it tastes good. I love the "Carne Asada Fries" here, but only get them when I have someone to share with because it's such a huge portion. The asada fries cost $8.10 which is a great price for the size of it. We are talking fries, beans, sour cream, salsa, cheese and a pile of carne asada. It does come with guacamole, but I asked that it be left off. The menu here has many options for everyone. 

Inside there are plenty of tables and a small salsa and veggie bar. It has been filled with customers when I have been here, so I am going to start calling my lunch order in to avoid the wait time. If you are on a time crunch and it's Wednesday, calling in your order is smart as well because more people are there that day loading up on the 99 cent chicken tacos.

Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.

I got the "Cranburkey" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  

I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!

My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the "happy side" of the menu.  She ordered the "Chix on Broadway".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   

I got a large "Mr Green" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.

The space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club.

I was invited here for dinner with the promise of being entertained by the most talented lounge singer in Las Vegas. Of course, how do you say no to that? The Bootlegger bistro is an old-school Vegas landmark whose owner was once a powerful lady in this town. The moment I walked in the door, I looked around and noticed that I was the youngest person in the dining room - everyone else had a good 20 years on me. No big deal. I've always been fond of the elderly - with their interesting stories and life experience. 

My friend Doug pointed to the gentleman playing the piano and said, "there's Jimmy Hopper, the man with an amazing voice!" 

I nodded then proceeded to order a bellini-tini and the tomato-basil bruschetta. My friend ordered some old-person's drink involving cognac and the escargot appetizer. This is an Italian restaurant with the typical Italian faire on their menu. I eyed an item that sounded delicious, the spinach ravioli in marinara sauce; unfortunately it was under the gluten-free section. After a moment of hesitation as I don't have Celiac disease and ultimately have no reason to order a gluten-free item, I decided to get it anyway because spinach and cheese sounded just way too good. At this point, my friend asked for another cognac drink and the fish of the day (mahi mahi with risotto and asparagus).

I thought the bellini-tini was great and that made up for the mediocre bruschetta appetizer. My friend, being a gentleman, offered me some of his escargot. They tasted pretty good! I don't know how much they cost but there were 4 or 5 of them on the plate so this is a fairly small item.

When my ravioli arrived, it was pretty delicious; the filling was perfect although the pasta pockets were a bit chewy because of being gluten-free I guess. Over all though, this is a fairly healthy item while being a huge entree so you are definitely getting good value for the price paid. 

I also got to try my friend's dish. Oh man, this item was so freaking good! The mahi mahi was flaky, moist, perfectly seasoned and the sauce it was in didn't overpower the fish. But you know what the best part was? The risotto underneath the fish. I could eat a whole bowl of this risotto! Yummmmmmmm! 

Meanwhile, Jimmy Hopper was over there belting out scores after scores, both oldies and songs he had written himself. Indeed, this man has a great great voice. My friend encouraged me to request a song so I did! Guess what song I requested? Royal. Yes! You're probably thinking, "whhhaaat?! She's crazy - requesting an old-school Vegas lounge singer to sing a pop song!!" But oh no. I'm not crazy. Because moments earlier, my friend told me that he heard Jimmy sang Royal yesterday and he was blown away at his rendition of Royal. So of course, my expectation was very high.

Jimmy read my request note, chuckled to himself and said, "Oh man. I'm still working on this song because there's a lot of backup singing and I'm a one-man show." So Jimmy then journeyed on to another oldie and finally, he turned on something from behind him and started the first notes of Royal. I was ecstatic!

Jimmy had modified this song to make it his own while still keeping true to the original melody.  This man is a genius. I LOVED this version of Royal! Where do I buy a CD of this particular song? 

Later that night, I was blown away again at Jimmy's musical ability when he started singing an opera song. Is there a musical genre that this man can't do? Hat's off to you sir! I'm so impressed!

Okay, so if you are too cool for jazz and lounge music, there's a bar area that's on the other side of the wall where you can just sit and have drinks. 

Come here for the music, ambience and the laid-back atmosphere. The food, though good, is just a bonus.

I've had my eye on Cafe Berlin for a hot minute. Always telling myself I was going to go but I wanted to give it some time. This location has changed hands and restaurants many, many times and if Cafe Berlin was not going to last - well, I didn't want to waste my time. But a year and half later, it's still here so it was time to try the place.

Let me start with my only complaint of this place - WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG TO COME HERE!?

My memories of Germany consist of a few different things: Good Times, Good Food, Good Wine and Good Beer. Living in Germany I have the luxury of having excellent German food. Those imbiss stands though. Delicious Brats, Pomme Frites with mayo, schnitzel that would rock your socks off. After leaving Germany, I just knew that I would never have German food that good again.

Well my friends, Cafe Berlin has the most amazing Jaeger Schnitzel. It is perfectly fried with the a very nice, light & crunchy breading. It is topped with the most delicious cream sauce with mushrooms. The size of the jaeger schnitzel was slighter smaller than something you would find in Germany but in the end it was the perfect serving and I was satisfied. The spaetzle was seasoned very well and soft and pillowy. 

I also ordered a side salad with German dressing. Amazing. The salad itself was nothing special but the dressing was made perfectly. Not too oily, not too much sugar, not too much vinegar. I asked for it on the side so I could dress my salad myself and I think this is key. 

Last but not least, if in a German restaurant you have to have a pretzel. There is just something about a German pretzel that I love. I remember walking to the bus stop in the morning when I lived in Germany and always stopping by the bakeries to get me a warm pretzel bun. The pretzel here reminded me so much of that. It was hot, warm and soft. Served with a cheese spread. The pretzel came out so soft and warm that I couldn't wait to eat it and alas, no picture. 

I left Cafe Berlin with a very happy belly. I remember just being happy overall after eating there. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I will have to visit a couple more times before I can do that. But if you want a great schnitzel, do your belly a favor and get over here today.

A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The dcor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.

The Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.

Their Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.

The Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. 

Service was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.

I have heard a lot about KoMex Fusion so when a new location opened up near me, I wanted to give it a try. The place was packed, but luckily there were still 2 open tables to choose from. I have no idea how many employees were in the back, but I only saw the same two girls working the whole time and they were doing a fantastic job at keeping all of the tables taken care of. Our server took the time to go over the menu with us and suggest things we might like try. 

After my "Mexican Coke" was brought to the table some complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole soon arrived. The guac was fresh and delicious! The salsa had a nice fresh flavor too. Hubby and I decided to order a few different things to try buffet style between us. 

Fried Wonton's ($1.50) - These came 5 to an order and were good! They were stuffed with green onion, ground beef & pork. The dipping sauce that came with it was sweet and yummy. 

Chicken Flauta ($2) - The flavor was very good and I can't even describe it, you will just have to try one of these tasty flautas yourself! It had some sour cream and pico de gallo on the plate as well. 

Fusion Tacos ($1.75 & $2.25 for flour tortilla) - I tried the pork and beef with one being on a corn tortilla and one on a flour tortilla. They weren't totally bad, but nothing spectacular to me. 

Beef Chow Fettuccine ($8.50) - This was the dish hubby wanted to try most. The cabbage and carrots were left out, but the portion was still hearty. The flavor of this dish was something new for me and I liked it. You can't go wrong on this dish with the price, portion and flavor. 

At the end of the meal fortune cookies and a fresh orange were brought to us. The orange was a light and tasty finish to our meal. I was very pleased with the service, taste and price here at KoMex Fusion!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

*Please make note that this review contains information about a salon not providing me with services that I paid for. Please proceed with caution when dealing with them*

Also, the owner wrote a note questioning the validity of my review based on negative reviews (completely ignoring the positive ones), but if you look at the review for his store, no one who gave that place a good score has more than a few reviews outside of one person. OBVIOUSLY, he's a scammer. 

Please forgive the one star above, this isn't a zero star system otherwise I gladly would have awarded this wreck of a salon one, or none as the case may be. 

First, the complaints about attitudes and inexperience are spot on. They have NO idea what they're doing at this salon.

I was a member of a different salon (note: these are franchised so they have no accountability to a corporate office which explains that extreme lack of professionalism) and came over to this one as it was closer to my house. 

I asked about specials and packages when I first came in and they explained them to me. I then chose a 12-session package for a little over $100. They told me that this gave me any choice of bed that I wanted. 

The first time I went in everything went relatively smoothly, except they charge you for the tanning canister that is required for you to be able to tan. What was I paying for then? Whatever. I tanned in a bed and then did the spray tan (a ritual I repeated each and every time I went in).

The second time I went in everything went south. They had no idea about my sessions, etc. They eventually 'figured it out' and I went on my way, repeating the steps above - two tans, etc. 

Every single time after that no one could figure out what was going on. I would stand there for 10 minutes waiting to tan while they figured my account out, AGAIN. I have no idea why this happened, and personally, it wasn't my problem. As a consumer with disposable income in this economy I have a right to not have any screw ups when I go to do something as decadent as tanning (and as simple). Forget it, that was never going to happen.

Please repeat the above for the third time.

The fourth time I went in and tanned fine, although the check-in routine stayed the same - confusion, confusion, solution. The spray tan didn't go so well and malfunctioned. Which, by the way, used to happen a lot with this machine, it seemed old. Anyway, the girl gave me a credit on my account so now I had five sessions left (this is important).

The fifth time I went in must have been a bad day for someone because the girl that helped me had a serious attitude problem. So much so that when I came out I told her that I didn't appreciate the way she treated me (that's really unusual for me - I believe in politeness at all costs and had shown it consistently with a place that could NEVER get my account right and cost me time constantly). Anyway.

For my sixth visit I called first to verify the amount of tans I had and to make an appointment to go in. Someone named Barbie answer the phone and AGAIN went into the computer and couldn't find ANYTHING for me. She said I must have used all of my tans. I said even if that was the case I'd still have one extra left from the time when the spray machine didn't work. She said 'sorry, there's nothing here.' 

Okay, all patience has almost run out. I told her that I am positive that she is the person I spoke with who said all this was fixed. She then said to me (verbatim), well I don't know if you came in when I wasn't in...' I stopped her, laughing incredulously, and said 'did you just imply that I stole something?' She then said I was rude and slammed down the phone. REALLY? REALLY? 

So, after that display of complete unprofessionalism, I call back and speak with Karenna. She tells me she somehow heard the whole conversation and that I was the rude one (right, I accused you of stealing?). She then proceeded to tell me (after Barbie, in our initial conversation admitted knowing who I was) that I had never been a member there, had never tanned there and had never paid them any money. Stop, I know. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone, too!

So, how much further could I have gone with this? It wasn't like I could get into their computer and prove anything. They get to keep my money without giving me the services I paid for, and because they are the final word, I get screwed.

Whatever you do, don't tan here. They are unethical and management will TELL you that they're franchised and if you have a complaint it will just come back to him, implying nothing will be done to them. Yikes. BAD BUSINESS.

Throwing an amazing party is not easy, I give them that. Tao, similar to other popular hot spots Rain, Tryst, Prive and clubs of the like, are so overcrowded that it's hard to enjoy yourself. Tons of people get on the guestlist, and those who aren't usually have to wait in a long line. When you're working at the door, the last thing you want to do is turn people away or make them wait. Trust me, I know the feeling. 

We had a group of 12, and it was really hard for us to stay together. Even though we were on the guestlist, only the girls got in for free. Guys had to pay a $20 cover. Had we planned things out so that we had table service, we would have gotten our own roped off VIP section. Instead, we took our chances and unfortunately were packed like sardines on the dance floor. We made the best of it, and I ended up having a great time dancing, even though I was bumpin' and grindin' with people on all sides. 

Jessica and Nicole got separated from us, but I found them standing near the window trying to look for us. They had gotten themselves into the VIP section next to boxer Bernard Hopkins who was in town for the fight. They took me back there, and we hung out there for a while. When our guy friends found us there, they were denied entry. That's when we decided to leave. While the rest of the group stayed and checked out Tao Beach upstairs (which was just as chaotic), we decided to call it a night. 

As we walked down to the restaurant, they had cleared the area out and there were hardly any people down there even though there was another DJ spinning there and the bar was less crowded. We probably could have gotten the rest of the group to come down and hang out with us there, but we were pretty much over the scene and took off. 

You'll find a lot of hot women put on display throughout the club. Although they are gorgeous girls with hot bodies, it was a bit disturbing to see them sitting in rose petal filled bathtubs and getting massages. I think what made it degrading was that they didn't look happy to be there and be stared at. I guess it's their choice, right?

She sells seashells by the seashore
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Fried calamari($12)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA
Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal

As a native Texan, I have a hard time even bringing myself to go to Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas - my palate is honed to Tex Mex, powerful salsas, reasonable prices...

I saw La Comida pop up and decided it would great to try a new place downtown that had what seemed like a relatively authentic menu and great location.  We made reservations for Saturday night and met our friends there - both of us securing rockstar parking (it was early for Saturday dinner) and a half-moon booth inside but right by the open patio.

One of our friends is Mexican and saw huarache on the menu, a childhood favorite.  We were given a mini galvanized tub of warm chips and salsa, which was plain - our friend asked the server in Spanish for the non-gringo salsa which got us a chile de arbol salsa, which was not much better.  Waters were served in mason jars which is cute.

The server did ask before we opened our menus if we wanted guacamole with our chips - my friend immediately agreed - to which we experienced dismay upon opening the menu and seeing it for $11 - and the $11 did not include a tableside guac in molcajete show - but instead a small side bowl that was not much bigger than the mini salsa container.  That was a disappointment - at least do it tableside to charge that much - what I can make for $2 with 2 avocados!

Our table's order was our friends' getting huarache and queso fundido, I ordered the ceviche trio, and Eric R. got the chicken enchiladas with mole.  He was pleased to hear it came with rice and beans.  When the food was delivered, the queso came with tortillas, and Eric got a small plate with his 2 enchiladas (topped with pickled onions), and I got a small plate (see pic) with 3 divided sections with ceviche.  My husband's sad face was attributed to the "communal" rice and beans, which he thought was bizarre since he was not sharing his with anyone.

The huarache had cheap meat, not like the kind our friend expected.  He was a bit disappointed.  Eric R.'s meal was cold - he had an enchilada then sent his plate and the communal beans and rice back to be reheated.  The kitchen was nice enough to give him 2 new enchiladas hot.  Of my 3 ceviches, the snapper one was tasteless (dry fish, pepper, and sliced green and red bell peppers) but the shrimp in a green sauce and the bay scallop with tropical fruit were very tasty.

Overall, it seemed just too expensive for small portions and food that was not memorable.  The only thing memorable is the rip-off guacamole that we were somewhat conned into ordering.  Our server was nice but it took awhile to get our check taken care of though it was not terribly busy at the early hour.  This place will definitely stay popular, so enjoy those $20 margaritas (not kidding) and $7 bottles of XX - no beers on tap.

I've been anticipating SLS opening their doors and now I'm sadly disappointed. 

Staff: The dealers at the tables were very friendly and welcoming. I agree with other reviewers that there are way too many employees standing around doing nothing but chatting with one another. We walked around and saw groups of 3 or more employees just leaning against the wall talking. Other than the dealers no other staff member said hello or went out of their way to acknowledge guests and seemed engrossed in their own conversations. 

Cleanliness: The amount of trash and dirt was astounding. The carpets were covered with cigarette ash and bits of junk. Either they don't have enough people cleaning or they don't seem to care to clean up. Maybe the staff that just stand around talking could take pride in their own establishment and pitch in. There were half empty glasses left out in the bars from the night before. Walking around and seeing that the bars left dirty things overnight was such a turnoff. The bathrooms had toilet paper strewn about all over the floor and the trash was piled high in the baskets. Plus the janitorial staff left piles of plastic bags of trash outside the bathroom entrance. 

The Griddle: We went here for breakfast and had to wait over 15 minutes to be seated when 2/3 of tables were empty. The line of people outside couldn't stop complaining about how poorly the 4 (yes, 4) hostesses were handling the seating. When asked about the hold-up their response was that the staff was going through a shift change.    After being seated it took a few minutes before anyone came by with water. Then, it took a few more minutes before our server came by. Another server brought someone else's food to our table and then my boyfriend's meal was brought first and it took over 5 more minutes for my food to come out. When we finished our meal about an hour later and walked out of the restaurant at about 9am the line to get in went around the corner and the staff must still have been going through a shift change because there were loads of empty tables inside. 

Spa: We wanted to check out the spa but an unfriendly guard brusquely told us that only guests can go to the spa. I don't know how the spa will do if their only clientele comes from the hotel. You would think that they would want more business. All the other spas on the strip welcome outside guests. 

I noticed that a lot of people who left positive reviews had specifically attended the grand opening party. I would imagine that in the hype of the event everything seemed great but during the day and to an average visitor this place is just a huge flop. Disappointing.

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.

The Mission is a wonderful restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale and priced accordingly.

We came here this past Friday night around 5;30 or so.  Over drinks and our meal, we keep discussing the term In-elasticity of demand.  That's economics, for how high you can raise prices before consumers will start cutting back.  

You see the food at The Mission is excellent!   It's delicious!  It's outstanding!  But, judging on how they pack them in, the investors who own The Mission, could easily raise prices by 10 or 20%, and no one would blink an eye.

Hopefully, you're not reading my Yelp Reviews for Economics lessons. But to find out about the dining experience and food.  LOL 

Since there is no Happy Hour at The Mission, we were lucky to get a table near the bar.  We ordered the "made at your table" Guacamole for $12.00.  Excellent!  If you do not believe me -- checkout the nearly half dozen photos other Yelpers have posted for this one menu item.  Yes, it's very good.  They cut up one avocado, add a pinch of salt, red onion, half a lime, cilantro, pine nuts and some grated mexican cheese. Creamy texture and yummy.

We ordered a glass of Sangria for $8.00. and a Mohito for $12.00.  Both were very good, though each had too much ice.  We also ordered off the appetizers menu the Chicken Anticuchos for $8.00, and Skirt Steak tacos for $12.00. 

The chicken comes on two skewers, with a very nice tasting mole that dominates.  It's seasoned with raisin, balsamic, sesame ,cocoa and peanuts.  Very nice.  The three small steak tacos were marinated in Tecate and smoked in their back yard. It's the smokey taste that makes the dish unique.  It also comes with green chili salsa, some diced avocado, cilantro and cotija on top.  These too were delicious and hit the spot.  

A shout-out to fellow Yelp'er Pepper T, who coined the term "Petite proteins" in her review.  Nicely said Pepper!  I believe it's nouveau cuisine.

We ordered one more drink before asking for the check.  The damage came to just over $69 including taxes, but before tip.  As I mention in the begining, The Mission gets very crowded and can feel claustrophobic.  It's also dark inside, and at times can be very noisy.

After the show at the Permorming Art Center down the street, we thought about coming back for dessert. But there was about twenty customers waiting outside to be seated.  Maybe next time.  In-elascity of Demand as they say.

***Avenue B's kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful, vibrant and filling; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***

Avenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake, Los Feliz or Atwater Village.  The restaurant has a simple caf-like dcor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.

Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.

The salmon entre seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.

The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.

If I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entre seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).

I also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.

The arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).

The cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).

For dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.

That candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crme brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.

The pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).

I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.

Service by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.

Prices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.

Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.

Parking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime.

This place is just a couple miles away from my house, so I have been watching it like a hawk! I came in with my boyfriend on grand opening day (today), which happened to be a Monday, the only day they're suppose to be closed. The place Was fully stocked with EVERYTHING. Macarons in every color of the rainbow, different flavored flans, cakes (whole and slices), eclairs, tarts, cookies, croissants, banquettes, etc. 

We came in for pastries, but my boyfriend ended up with a sandwich combo (iced tea, French onion soup, roast beef/pesto sandwich) for $9.95. I ordered a 12oz latte ($3) and a few macarons ($1.10ea) pistachio, pistachio/chocolate, and rose. 

The soup was very flavorful. I didn't expect it to taste that great, so I was pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was a pretty generous portion, considering the combo price. You get a whole croissant with loads of meat inside. I didn't try it since I'm not a big roast beef fan, but my bf killed it pretty fast, so I'm assuming it was good. 

The espresso was nicely made considering it came from an automatic machine and it went very well with my 3 delicious macarons. The guy accidentally gave me a ginger macaron instead of my rose macaron. Luckily I really like ginger, so it was a satisfying mistake, but I only took a bite before trading it for the rose macaron! All the macarons were very fresh with a light, crisp outer layer and soft center. They all tasted exactly like you would imagine the flavor to taste. When I had a bite of the ginger, I felt like I ate a piece of the actual root! And when I ate the rose macaron, I imagined smelling a bouquet of roses. 

Overall, this place is amazing. I usually expect a few kinks when going to a brand new place, but all the food and pastries we had were amazing. This would've been a 5 star review, but I felt like the customer service wasn't equally distributed. We were sitting just two tables away from a couple that the cashier/server constantly kept checking up on and conversing with without checking up on us a single time, even after I had to exchange the macaron he mistakenly gave me. He even gave the couple some complimentary pastries (not exactly sure what they were) to try. I just feel that he should've at least checked up on us or talked to us if he was going to constantly give them special treatment.

This is really a 4.5 star review. I love Jersey Mike's! When I walked in there were plenty of smiling faces and friendly employees. The taste of the food is important obviously, but customer service goes a long way and this location delivers when it comes to both of those things.

When looking at the menu board I was having the hardest time deciding what to order. So many of the subs were something that I would eat. The cool thing about that is, there will be something new I can try out when I go back, so I could end up with a few favorites to rotate between. They offer a "Sub in a Tub" for those of you who do not like your meat between bread. You can just pick any sandwich on the menu and they will make it the same way they would on a sandwich, but put it in a bowl minus bread for you. They have a variety of "Wraps" to choose from. The sandwich sizes are mini (4 1/2 inches), regular (7 1/2 inches), and giant (15 inches) and the bread options are wheat or white. The bread is baked fresh at each location. 

One of the workers suggested "The Original Italian" since it was their most popular sub. It sounded delicious so hubby and I decided to split one of those. The giant for this sandwich was priced at $11.95 and then it jumped to $13.95 before tax with the addition of extra cheese. It had provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. Jersey Mike's uses quality meats and slices it fresh right in front of you. I ordered it "Mike's Way" which means they add onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar, oil and spices. The sandwich was very good! I will order this one in the future for sure. The flavors all melded so well together.

I was very impressed with the knowledge of the employees. The sandwiches on the menu that are numbers 43 and 56 have meaning. The number 43 is the football jersey of the CEO. Apparently he started working for Jersey Mike's (the original on the jersey shore) when he was a teen and ended up buying it later on and shaping it into what it is today. The number 56 is a nod to the year the first Jersey Mike's opened up.

They offer a "Shore Points" reward program. You can sign up and use a card or just give your phone number when ordering to accumulate points towards free sandwiches. 

Parking can be very frustrating at this location. It is tight in this area so please just be careful.

You can also place your order online or by phone.

Catering is available and they have a few different options for that.

Be hungry and ENJOY!

This ended up being Plan B after the debacle that was "Bastille Day" at a restaurant that rhymes with "Barche Macchus" when they offered to seat us in a storage room.  I've had this place bookmarked for 3 years and it was finally time, baby!

Bob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!

We got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary "garlic cheese toast".  

The wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor. 

All entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!

Somehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.

Considering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.

Prime; one of the top four steak houses in Vegas.  A pantheon of beef.  Where Bacchus reigns over a 500+ selection of to die for wines.  Where the "brown" libations are over the top.

At Prime, the menu is seasonally updated.  The fall of 2012 features an outstanding, air flown colossal stone crab appetizer (three huge claws the size of your hand with a pile of knuckle and leg meat).  Heaven and at $75, and worth every penny.  Sweet.  Perfect.  The steak tartar on a platter of Carpaccio is delicious but slightly unbalanced with over the top Asian spice heat.  Finally, the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Wow.  The fat of the bacon permeates the rich, sweet flesh of the barely cooked through shrimp.  Outstanding.

Beef mains are to die for.  Japanese A5 Kobe cuts of beef (4oz minimum $35 per ounce).  Sublime if you don't over indulge.  A four to six ounce portion is enough for anyone.  Offered in a strip, rib, or fillet cut.  The rib is the most flavorful.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR BEEF COOKED BEYOND RARE.  You are wasting your money as the fat will melt during cooking and the beef taste like any other piece of beef.

The 30 day dry aged, bone fillet is excellent.  Huge umame finish without tasting edgy.  Soft and tender.  The veal chop is equally good.  Sweet, deep beef flavor from free ranged calves.  Double cut, perfectly seared and moist throughout.  

All mains come with sauces and sides.  They match and are very flavorful but do not pass on ordering some veg and off the menu potato dauphinois to share.  Sides are perfectly cooked.  Rich and refreshing.

Killer wine list with great depth of cult wines.  Great values to be found at higher price points (best priced Screaming Eagle in Vegas). Outstanding cognac selection.

Service is excellent.  Friendly and extremely efficient.

Note:  Unlike most Vegas restaurants, for reservations, you MUST be a high status member of Mlife to book the best tables and times on short notice.  If you use OpenTable, make your reservation at least 60 days in advance  Outdoor and window tables where you can view the incredible fountain show at the Bellagio are very difficult to secure.

A truly memorable experience in Vegas not afforded to everyone.  Do whatever it takes to try it.  

A dozen plus visits since my initial review.  Extremely consistent.  Highly Recommended.

Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  

Shocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about "keeping it real" just from these itty bitty green things.

My wife was ready to order "bakudan" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  

I didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  

I also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      

Their chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  

Chicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)

Some stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  

None of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!

My Favorite Vegas Sweet Stop! I got chocolate wasted and wouldn't have minded spending a whole day in this chocolate dream. 

Their chocolate drinks are heavenly. Friend had an italian in a cute hug mug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=efFt78-ToFIXyJm5ZIjr4g
Dude had an 80s milkshake which was soooo delicious! Love the alice in wonderland "Drink Me" cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WslMBkiMScJAM6fOITjHQg

I ADDED BACON to my Guilt Free Omelette (CG style) and this was one of my favorite breakfast dishes i've had in a long time (thanks Janice C!). The omelette had some veggies and cheese, came with a side of potatoes. It came with an awesome sweet biscuit served with a side of butter and a side of milk chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WjX7TqdKnJfQ8_rL21lnNw. The potatoes dipped in the chocolate worked delicious as well. 
Friend had the Brenner Kobe Burger- but didn't swoon over it. But the fries were good. Dipped them in chocolate- even better! 
Shared a apple cinnamon waffle and it came out soo pretty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=ZM1r3Jgh1rIOAd8CLg_w8g
Loved loved the tiny vial of chocolate sauce and the tiny chocolate pearls to dress up our waffles. The Vanilla icecream made it all perfect. 
While waiting for your food, u can check out the boutique inside filled with chocolate galore. The bill even came in the cutest chocolate bar like tin. 
I couldn't leave without getting me the chocolate walnut cookie that Dru C wrote about, at the stand where they also display the chocolate pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=4XrN-0eKjrZ_O1MZPwUwDA, cupcakes and chocolate syringes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=Y_OtGVh8HWQQzXQcHFcZRg
If u like the texture of Mrs Fields cookies, you will love this one which is 10 times better.I can say this is the best cookie i've ever had! It's $5.00, but it's big and super packed with chocolate and every bite is buttery bliss. Just make sure to eat it right away or if you're gonna savor it bite by bite like me and keep putting it away only to open the bag again to take another bite- get an extra bag cuz the grease will seep through- in the good way of course. 

I cannot wait to go back to get myself a couple more cookies and stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

*at the Forum Shoppes at Caesar across from the huge ass H and M store. Mens while ur waiting for your girl at the 3 floor H and M, you can get yourself a chocolate syringe and die happy.

DEAL ME IN

This place is a total find and is located on Fremont Street next to the Heart Attack Cafe. You can not miss it because they have a blinking red neon sign that says $2 Tacos. Enough said!!!

I needed a light snack before dinner after skipping lunch, so I decided to pop in here. They had a large selection of meats to choose from. I decided to go with a pork carnitas taco and a shredded beef taco. Both were really good and packed full of meat. The $2 price also included a choice of hot sauce and I went with the medium green salsa.  Cilantro and raw onions were included too. I skipped the cilantro but dived in on the raw onions. Luckily I had a tin of the Yelp shaped breath mints to freshen me up afterwards. 

The meats were really tasty. There is nothing like a slow roasted piece of meat in my book. I saw the grilled steak and grilled chicken but they looked a little dried out. This location has many of its meats precooked and sitting in warming trays. This is why I choose the two meats I did. The pork carnitas and shredded beef were sitting in their own natural juices and I knew they would be yummy at any time of the day. I was dead on. 

I decided to go with a medium salsa because I was taking a redeye flight back home and I wasn't looking forward to terror at 30,000 feet, so I played it safe. They had several salsas to choose from but I was happy with the medium salsa verde. It had the perfect amount of spicy without being too over powering. 

The location is in a food court without any  mall. There were two other restaurants in here. One serving pizza/pasta and the other serving Asian food. I did not try the other food at these two places but was offered some Asian chicken on a toothpick that I nicely turned down. 

So if your on Fremont Street looking for a light but filling snack then I highly recommend this place. The tacos were really good and I would come back here in a heartbeat for a good meal deal that won't break the bank.

The ramen scene continues to grow. Yes Monta Chaya, Monta's sister restaurant is the latest joint to open up. I've never tried their restaurant in Chinatown but I know it's very popular with both locals and tourists. So I was excited that they opened here in Henderson.   From the parking lot you won't be able to spot it but It's located between Japan Creek and Golds Gym in the strip mall on the corner of Eastern/Serene.  The sign for their storefront will be up soon according to one of the servers I spoke to. 

As with the other noodle houses, this place has sit table service. Your hostess will seat you at a table or counter. I chose their counter on this visit. Their furnishings reminded me of West Elm type stuff. The dark woods used makes the place look more stylish and gives it a more upscale feel. The seating arrangement didn't feel too crowded.  My server said they were so busy right before I came and that the lunch crowd had just left.

Server gave me 2 menus one with noodle  dishes and entrees and another that Monta Chaya serves exclusively. So you know I just had to try something off the Chaya Dishes menu.  I chose Chashu Bans (bahns). This one was glazed pork belly slice in a steamed bun. They come as 2 appetizer sized portions.

The Tonkatsu Ramen I ordered is just broth and noodles. I chose to customize with add ons they had. So there is an additional charge for them.  So keep in mind your order can add up. 

There was little wait from the time my order was taken to when I was served. When my order for the Tonkotsu Ramen came up, oh boy, I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl packed with noodles. My extras that I added were soft boiled egg and corn so my bowl was pretty full. 

The noodle soup was really good. The pork had just enough fat, the broth was savory. I personally thought it was just a tad salty and not as rich in flavor as the Tonkotsu broth over at the noodle house on Tropicana.  Still I enjoyed my bowl of ramen.  I asked if there is a smaller portion since this was way too much noodles for me.  My server said I can just request 1/2 noodles more broth next time. They still charge you the same price.
 
Service here was spot on. Everyone was friendly and polite.  Unlike the other Asian restaurant that recently opened up at the casino, the employees here are prepared and ready for the rush hour crowd. I'm lovin the ramen craze and welcome another one here on this side of town!

We stayed at the Renaissance for a week, and couldn't have been happier with a hotel.  It starts off with the staff.  Everyone we encountered was very friendly and outgoing, and you knew they were willing to do anything you asked to make your stay happy.

The rooms were also very nice, being both spacious and including all of the amenities you would want.  A nice television, a big desk, refrigerator, an in-room safe, comfortable beds, and most importantly to me a shower with tons of water pressure.  And all of the rooms have wonderful views, depending on which way you're facing.  Our view was the US Airways Center, Chase Field, and the mountains in the background.  (Not sure if technically they were mountains. But they were beautiful anyway.). It was very cool to always know that when you looked out the window you were either going to see the hustle and bustle of downtown life, or the serenity of the landscape in the distance.

As far as food options, there is Marston's Cafe and the Icon Lounge.  We never had a chance to eat at Marston's, but we hit up the Icon a few times.  That will be covered in a separate review.  This will also cover Marston's, since all of the food is prepared in a central kitchen and the menus overlap somewhat.  There are also tons of local food options within a block or two of the hotel.

The fitness center is a bit on the small side, but there are a few ellipticals and treadmills, along with some free weights and Nautilus equipment.  It's enough to get the job done when you're on the road.  There's also a huge outdoor seating area with tables and chairs, along with couches, to relax and enjoy yourself in the fresh air.  This is also where the pool area is located.

So why only four stars?  For one, the prices.  You can get a good deal on a room, but the prices of everything else is where they will get you.  And definitely be wary if you have a rental car, because on-site parking is $27 per day.  And then there is the issue of the elevators.  If you had to be in the lobby at a certain time, you had to give yourself at least a 10-minute headstart, if not more.  And definitely pay attention when you hit the down button.  You'll notice that it will go out on you when you're not looking, and no elevator will be heading your way.  And it will happen again, and again.  After the first couple of days, we realized the easiest method of getting to the lobby was actually catching an up elevator, and then riding back down.  And everyone else figured this out as well, so when elevators did actually show up, sometimes you had to wait three or four cycles for one with room in it.

I know that's a minor gripe, but when you're taking the elevators multiple times per day over the course of a week, it does get frustrating.  If they ever get the elevator situation under control, I could easily see revisiting up to five stars.

Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athne in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!

Thanks Yelp, I know you're not a dating site, but Flores AC and my air conditioner are a match made in heaven and it was love at first sight! 

It was a grueling day, manual labor in the hot Phoenix sun really does a number on you. Mid July, 110 degrees, sweating so much people think you just jumped in the neighbor's pool. whew. I get my underoos in a bunch just thinking about people who work outside. Luckily, I just have a quick walk from the office, to the car then the car to the perfectly cooled 87 degree condo in CenPho. It's on a timer and set to start cooling exactly 45 minutes prior to my daily arrival. 

What the? What's going on? OMG. No. Please, no. Wait, NOOOOO. Now don't hyperventilate. You've seen this before. OK. Breathe, deep breaths. I think I remember someone suggesting to turn off the AC for an hour, killing the compressor. Sometimes the coolant lines can get frozen. Yes, that's right. I know its 110 degrees outside, but yes this sometimes does happen. I guess this is a good time to swap out my return air filter - it is a few weeks overdue once every 2-3 months. So after an hour; well, it could have been like 58 minutes, but I didn't really want to wait any longer. I cut the air back on, gave it 10 minutes and still nothing. Well, these tried and true AC tricks didn't quite cut it this time. Time to get someone to Yelp me out with this one.

I popped open Yelp and searched my way through Phoenix for "Air Conditioning", a handful of results showed up but really, my first call was Flores AC. They outshine just about everyone else that came up by a good 30 reviews and have a 4.5 overall rating. This is my guy. 

I explained to him that I tried everything in my bag of tricks already, but I was just blowing a bunch of hot air. "No problem" he replied and said "I'll be there in 15 minutes." really? 15 minutes? whatever. "OK hunny, they'll be here sometime soon-ish." They said 15 minutes, but I dunno. I'll believe it when I see it."

... Told you so, service guys and contractors, they never get here on time. 15 minutes. I knew he couldn't get here in 15 minutes; heh, now where's my free pizza? pssshh.  It took them 17 minutes to get here. I knew it, two minutes. 

He had my AC fixed up in about 20 minutes, apparently a bad compressor. At just $160 for the part, the call, and his time - those other guys have done me wrong for the last time. 

From walking in the door and discovering my AC wasn't working to happily signing the charge to my credit card, 1.5 hours - you just don't find that anywhere else. They were super friendly, family owned, and in business since 1980 something. Lets face it. 30+ years is longer than some people have lived in Phoenix, let alone been doing AC in Phoenix. Fully licensed, bonded, and insured; you don't have to worry about weather or not you're getting some Joe off the street; or George, Chas, or Parker for that matter.

Stay cool Phoenix and happy Yelping!

Admittedly, I had prepared to hate this place with a passion you only see in the movies.

The name just screamed "flax seed and watercress salad".

Not that I'm hating, mind you. I'm sure the same people that just had a foodgasm thinking of flax seed and watercress will look right back at me and go "raw fish? chinese-mexican fusion? GROSS". 

I just realized that's the first time I've ever used the word "fusion" to describe a restaurant. I finally feel like I'm grasping the intricacies of foodie lingo. 

The next test is to say the word "shi shi" in a sentence with a straight face. 

When we sat down in the purgatory of warm, earthy tone-laced interior design that was the restaurant, the waiter informed us it was "soul food night". Normally, when some restaurants say it's "blank blank night" that usually mean that's what the special is or that it's a bargain. No, at Urban Tea Loft, "Soul Food Night" means that's all they're serving. 

We all ordered what we thought would be amusing forays into "Chandler nightlife with a hint of elegance" or some nonsense. 

After browsing the extensive tea menu, we settled on a pot of Rooibos Chai, iced. 

The waiter brought out a pot of lukewarm tea and three glasses with ice in them.

Kay......

I realize, in retrospect, that serving the ice separately was the wiser move, but I remember feeling really confused at first.

It'd be like saying "I'd like that on the rocks, please" and the bartender gives you your drink in a martini glass and a shooter full of ice cubes and lets you at it.

Actually, that's not "like what happened" at all. That's EXACTLY what they did.

In its defense, the tea was magnificent. Fantastic, really. It was spicy, creamy, and smooth. I almost wish we could've afforded to order more of it, but we just had to try the food. Stupid hunger.

For 13 dollars I got a meager filet of shake and bake catfish, a cup of watery coleslaw, and a cornbread muffin. And not even the puffy, scrumptious muffins you find in grocery stores.

No, that was not to be my fate. The muffin was barely poking out of its holder. I remember being upset that for 13 dollars they couldn't even be bothered to take it OUT OF THE FUCKING PAPER, but I realized that was for the better; the moment I took it out of the paper, the muffin disintegrated into crumbs, and I spent the rest of my meal spooning it up.

The coleslaw was soggy. Yes. I said it. Soggy. I know, right? How can something that sits in mayonnaise all day be soggy?

I DON'T KNOW EITHER!

Perhaps I've been spoiled on British and German cole slaw, but I expect it to have a bit of a crunch to it. It's not boiled cabbage, after all. It's not wrong to expect some life in  your slaw. 

And not to call a "tea loft" that serves soul food unimaginative, but c'mon, where's the creativity? Where's the apple or pineapple chunks? 

Usually with such a pretentious atmosphere you get a little "experimentation" with the menu to make it seem "urbanized".

Oh well. 

The catfish, while crunchy and delicious, just wasn't filling. Again, in their defense, most places that serve fish try to gip (sic) you on it.

No wonder people stick to Red Lobster. It's corporate and soulless but at least you don't have to hit a drive-thru on the way home.

Look, I know we live in a land-locked state, but it's not like you're fishing for the damn thing yourself. I don't see you out there with a harpoon. Don't try to fucking fool me.

Misty S got the vegetable plate for 9.75. By far I think the best deal. Sure, it's just a bunch of little trays of sides and is even less filling than the aforementioned meat entree, but you get twice as much of the "New American" feel and flavor.

Fun Fact: Having spent my childhood in Europe, I was raised to believe that fish does not count as meat, and I still have a hard time remembering NOT to suggest sushi to my vegetarian friends.

So, come for the tea, and stay to pay for the bill. BUT ONLY FOR THE TEA.

Anything else and you're just wasting your money.

Which can't be that bad. Everyone's doing it these days.

Amirite, GMC?

We arrived at Snooze for what would be our final meal here AZ before heading back home. My sister claims this is her favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix--which is a huge recommendation considering every breakfast here has been terrific. As I perused the menu I noticed they had a nice selection of fancy pancakes and they all sounded terrific. My Brother-in-law pointed out that they had a thing called the "Pancake Flight" where you can choose any three flavors you want.

Pancake Flight:

Pineapple Upside Down Pancake- I had to get this since it was one of the Yelp Review Highlights, and it was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype. I actually would've appreciated more Pineapple in it. While it was good, I doubt I'd order it again. 3*

Molten Chocolate Lava Pancake- This was a little slice of Heaven; it's a chocolate buttermilk pancake with a huge dollop of chocolate custard in the middle and topped with a Tangerine Glaze. Oh, yeah.. it's as good as it sounds. 4.5*

Pancake of the Day- Snooze features a different Pancake everyday, so be sure to ask your server before making any final decisions. On the day I was there it was some kind of Salted Caramel/Cinnamon concoction with a dollop of Ancho-Chocolate Custard in the middle. My jaw dropped as our waitress described it--much as yours did as you read my description. It was superb, and if you're lucky enough to be there when they feature it you *must* get it. 5*

Chocolate-Peanut Butter- My wife ordered this as a side to her eggs, and it was so massive I had to help her finish it--one of the perks when you're married to a light eater! It was pretty good, and tasted a lot like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I'm not a huge Reese's fan, but if you are then this should be right up your alley! 3.5*

Coffee- Above-standard Diner Coffee, but nothing special. They have a whole placard on your table ballyhooing their coffee, but I just didn't get it. 3.5*

Service & Ambiance- Our server was excellent, and I wish I could remember her name and give her credit, but I misplaced the receipt as well. She was a tall, pretty brunette--you can't miss her. Snooze is a very clean and modern-looking, but I found some of their decorations to be a bit cloying--especially that huge asterisk logo thingy. The place also gets very loud, which I don't particularly want first thing in the morning. Time to invest in some sound dampeners, me thinks. 4.5*-service/2.5*-Ambiance

Value- Standard AZ value of less than $10 for breakfast, but still cheaper than Cali pricing. 4*

Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast here at Snooze; I was tempted to give it a 5th star, but the noise factor was a bit of a turn-off. I'd still probably say it's a solid 4.5-star breakfast joint, and I'd definitely go again and again if I lived in the area; I'll just try to remember to bring some earplugs next time.

After spending the morning at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, I typed into my cell phone "Where is a unique place to have lunch near the Phoenix Indian Medical Center?" and sent the text to KGB (542542). As we ventured into the hot sun, I recieved my answer...Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread

*ding!* one of the few Native American resturants in the city that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet!! Let's go!! After lunch plans with one of my favorite Navajos fell through - I guess a Navajo Taco would suffice! :P 

We entered the blue and white tiled room and were met by a very tired Navajo girl who spoke of problems with the DMV throughout our meal. We sat down and took it all in, the small glass case with bottles of hot sauce, pottery and earrings for sale; the pepsi frige that held nothing but Shasta soda. Uber rez! lol and the lack of a public restroom (BOO!!)

I ordered a double Navajo burger and my mom got the Pima Taco (beans are crushed  as opposed to the Navajo tacos where the beans are whole) and two teas. We sat down and waited for our tea, which, to our annoyance, didn't come until our food did. We asked for ketchup and salsa and the hot sauce was NOT good. I have no idea what the heck that stuff was... but it wasn't cute. They would've been better off opening up a can of El Pato or Tapitio than dispensing that stuff. I think it was bad. The ketchup was good though! :P 

The food itself... was meh. Nothing great. I didn't really read the menu, or I would have noticed that the burgers come with roasted green chilis... something I'm not a fan of... but I chose to just go with it and eat it anyway. The chili brought a nice kick to things. The burger itself was just a burger, it needed something... like CHEESE! I love cheese! :P 

The bread was kind of tough... and obviously Navajo... made with the superfind Blue Bird Flour which is like GOLD in the Navajo Rez... women LITTERALLY make dresses out of their cloth Blue Bird Flour sacks! And I could tell they used powdered milk in their recipe, when the edges are significatly thick it's the milk reacting to the hot oil. When the dough is fried when fresh... it creates an awesome fluffy affect... but at Sacred Hogan, there were cracks and flakes on one side of the bread which means that the dough was left out in the elements and not kept covered and moist... which is kind of gross... the dough gets hard and when fried creates these little tiles that are hard and the rest of the dough loses moisture which makes the bread lose its flaky goodness. 

My mom wasn't thrilled with her Pima Taco... as a Pima, I guess she oughta know what its supposed to be like! She said it was okay, but the salsa made it not so good. She prefers the light crispiness of FBH, so do I. the ONE thing I like about this place is their lunch special... they will make half a taco, of your choice... for $5!! That's pretty rad! 

To my yelpers, I say skip this place. The tables were dirty and grimey and not in a good way... where its part of the ambiance, like Carolina's. The staff stared at us the entire time we ate and complained about their personal problems. The food took over 20 minutes to make and the worst food crime... they brought back the MONSTROSITY that is the Indian Dessert!!

WTF?! No one eats like this on the rez!! NO ONE!! If you want to loose some toes, eat this fucking thig! A whole frybread, topped with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinna-sugar! That is disgusting... i'm sorry. it's gross! These flavors cannot possible be good!! If you want a nice dessert, JUST get a plain bread with EAITHER honey OR powdered sugar!! GEEZ!

To answer Mr. K's question... The FBH uses a simpler recipe of flour, salt, baking powder & very hot water. It's hyper use of baking powder creates it crispiness... and Navajos are not as liberal with their baking powder and some use powdered milk which creates a thicker more rich frybread. Both tribes typically use crisco veggie oil or shortening to fry their bread in, but some of the old timers still prefer good ol' fashioned lard! Navajo frybread is usually smaller in diameter, where as O'odham bread is usually larger, but thinner... ummm... think of Navajos as the chicago deep dish of Frybread... and O'odham as the New York thin crust of frybread!

After seeing so many of my friends check in to this place and proceeded to give it no less than 4 stars, I knew it had to be good. Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!

So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entre comes out. 

So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place "Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sauted veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it. 

As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.

So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!

Located inside the newly erected SLS Hotel in Vegas, Jos did not hold back with construction on this massive restaurant.  Once you pass the grand entrance, drama abounds as you're invited into a dimly lit space that's very much like the Bazaar in Los Angeles with interesting chachkes baubles and distinctive chandeliers of various shapes and sizes.   

While our table was being prepared, we opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few fascinating cocktails crafted by the bartender. 

Moments later, we were escorted to our table where our server Nick introduced himself. 
Nick was warm friendly and offered some thoughtful suggestions from the menu. On that note, I'd have to say my experience was elevated to VIP status because he was quite the accomplished server. He was very attentive and made every effort to check with us throughout the evening and ensured our experience was nothing less than top notch. 

Foie Gras Cotton Candy - A classic at The Bazaar that is not to be missed, especially since it's been banned practically everywhere else!

Bagel & Lox
Plump salmon roe served with soft cream cheese in a light and crispy cone. Briny yet smooth and creamy with a crunchy finish, phenomenal!

Grissini Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - 
Fragrant onion infused breadsticks wrapped with thinly sliced wagyu beef that's so insanely soft & tender, it will virtually melt in your mouth.  Served with a decadently rich and flavorful Parmesan espuma dip, your mouth will be savoring the rich permeating flavors long after you've devoured every morsel of this fantastic dish.

King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail - 
Served chilled on a bed of ice, I quickly noticed generous portions of chunk king crab & plump shrimp bathing in a bright red cocktail sauce. My mouth quickly started to water and once I took a bite, my eyes lit up. Bright acidity from the sauce coupled with the fresh juicy and plump king crab meat & shrimp made for a light and refreshing cocktail that was refreshingly substantial down to the very last bite.

Oysters 
Kushi, Shiboku, Blue Point - 
Fresh, briny, perfectly sized with a plump and juicy mouthfeel and went down the hatch beautifully.

Foie Gras floating island - 
Served in a small tea cup, this flavorful dish was far from dainty. It was actually quite rich and velvety smooth with a spectacular nutty finish. Foie gras lovers will revel in this richly satisfying dish.

Robuchon Potatoes - 
With the signature Robuchon name stamped on these potatoes, I was confident I was in for a treat but words simply can not describe the out of body experience that you'll have when you try these amazing mashed potatoes. Buttery smooth and decadently rich. Simply divine. 

Roasted Corn - 
Don't let the diminutive size fool you, these snappy little guys don't only pack an irresistible crunch but a surprisingly spicy kick, as well! 

Skirt Steak - 
A beautifully cooked steak with a perfectly pink tender and juicy flesh.

Kobe - 
Easily the best cut of steak ive ever had. Buttery, juicy, fatty, tender and infinitely satisfying. You'll literally shed a tear of joy when you enjoy this outstanding cut of premium beef. And trust, this beef is legit! They even prove it with an actual certificate of authenticity that's handed to you at the end of your meal! Now that's rich ;)

We ended our meal with a selection of the restaurant's fine desserts presented in a beautiful red pastry box. 

I'd have to say this was one of my better dining experiences in Vegas and much of it came from the wonderful service and of course, inspiring cuisine!

Happy Eats!

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the "3 Tacos" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a "Pulehu Steak Burrito" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of "Coconut Bark" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! 

You can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru.

Lunch here was unexpectedly good!

I had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!

So after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.

Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.

Blue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  

Smoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.

Grouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.

We passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  

Eyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.
Nose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!
Ear ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!
Mouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!
Tummy ~ Very well satisfied!

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

This review is based on hotel service and MANAGEMENT only (Manager Roberto and Pool Manager Chris) 

My brother, fiance, a friend, and I decided to stay at PH because my brother had a few free comped nights. We were there for 5 days (wed-mon) and was charged roughly $650. Pretty good deal we thought.

The day that we checked out (Monday), the bill came to $1500. Um, what?

We knew we messed up by using the wifi (13.99 per DEVICE), but there was no way it was going to be an additional $700 for wifi. When we went through the bill, we saw that there was a "Pool Bar" charge. We had NO idea what that was or what that meant. We went back to the front desk where Cecile helped us out.

She said the charge was from getting drinks at their pool. UM, what x 2??
We asked her what day was this because we only went to their pool ONCE on Thursday for like 30 mins and we never EVER went to the bar, just went there to tan. My brother had to work on the weekdays so he never even been to the pool. He had to work from the room. She told us it was on Friday. UM WHAT x 3?!?!

Cecile then told us she was going to call the pool and will get back to us when she talks to them. We left to the Miracle mall and received a call from Cecile 30 mins later. Came back to the front desk and she tells us, "They said it was YOU, you were at the pool and they remember you." Excuse me? Who is THEY?? Then she goes and ask, well maybe it was one of your friends who went. WTF? Definitely frustrated, she told us to step to the side and that she will have the manager come talk to us.

20 minutes pass and ROBERTO comes out from the back. There was another upset guest in front of us so Roberto was "helping" him first. Observing from the side, it was obvious that Roberto was one of those type of managers that was not willing to help you or hear you out. He even called security on the other upset guest. Whatever.

When it came to our turn, we explained to him why we were there. He did not make eye contact, just kept looking around and just basically NOT listening to us. We told him that Friday, NONE of us ever stepped into the pool. My fiance, friend and I were at Drais from 11am-3pm (where my fiance actually got HURT and we had to go to the hospital for him to get stitches. So we have proof that we werent there). My brother who was working in the room, had problems with the wifi, so he called for guest services around 11:30am and tech support came to the room around 330. He then left to go gamble downstairs from 4-6pm. The "POOL BAR" bill said that my brother was drinking it up from 12:35pm-5:20pm. THERE was NO WAY we were there.

After pointing this out and asking them to check the security camera and ALSO my brothers player card (since he was gambling during the time), Roberto then says he will have to call the Pool Manager to come down to talk to us.

We stood at the front desk for literally 1 hour. Roberto would pop his head out from the back room from time to time and ask if the pool manager came yet. Uh, no. 

FINALLY, a guy wearing a blue polo shirt steps out. He looks at us and so we ask,  are YOU the pool manager? He says yes. So this is CHRIS, the "pool manager". Having to tell him AGAIN what our situation was, he seemed a little bit more sympathetic. He looks at the bill and tells us, "wow, the bill was $500 and there was already an automatic $80 gratuity, but then there was an addtional $120 tip, that does look very sketchy. It makes me question if my employees are checking ID." In our heads we're like THANK GOODNESS someone understands. 

COMPLETELY WRONG.

He then proceeds to say, "But these 2 servers are my best servers and they're good people so I can't see them doing that". WTF? He then tells us hold on and goes back to where Roberto is. We can see the back door from here and for some reason they decided to close it.

5 minutes later they both come out and tells us, "Sorry, there's nothing we can do about this now. You have to just dispute it with your credit card." My brother then asked if he can get a copy of the pool bar receipt to see who signed it and Chris said they can't do that. He then leaves and tells my fiance "hope you're doing better". WTF.

Roberto then tells us again, they can't do anything about this now and that we have to dispute the charges. He grabs our bill and then tells us, "oh but let me remove some of this wifi charges for you." Ok, thanks for removing the wifi charges, but you can't remove the POOL BAR charge?!? Complete BS.

I've never been so frustrated in my life. They have security cameras, they can call the players card to check the times my brother gambled, they can call guest service to verify my brother called for help with the wifi, etc, but NOPE. 

WORST service ever and we will NEVER EVER stay here again.

***Le Cirque is a French restaurant with a quality similar to La Folie and Gary Danko; the food is decent but because it is in Las Vegas, it (like many other high-end Vegas spots) is not worth the high price tag***

Le Cirque is a well regarded transplant from New York City.  It is a French restaurant, but it is a much less formal dining experience than Joel Robuchon or Guy Savoy.  The restaurant's decor is a signature element.  The room is covered in circus murals and even the ceiling is a tent canopy to really create a circus-esque atmosphere (albeit a high end one).

Several menu options are available.  There is a six course tasting menu (where you have some choices) as well as a 3-course a la carte starter, entree and dessert option.  A fast pre-theater menu (of 3 courses) is also available.

I went with the 3-course a la carte menu and added an extra starter.  The meal started with a trio of salmon amuses.  There was salmon tartare with roe, salmon gravlax with honey and dill, and smoked salmon atop a potato waffle.  All of the amuses were good and really showcased the salmon.

There was a wide variety of bread options.  I chose the pretty good bacon baguette.  I also had the French bread, which had a pretty good chew.

I started with the white alba truffle risotto, which was expensive but very good.  The risotto rice was very nicely cooked.  It was al dente with a noticeable bite.  The risotto was creamy and had a good Parmesan flavor (some might find it a tad too strong or salty). 

The white truffles were great--very nice flavor and strong aroma.  The truffles were not as good as the ones I had in DC at CityZen, but that could just be because white truffle season is ending. The only thing that could have been better was the presentation.  They should have shaved the truffles tableside.

If you do not want to pay the supplemental charge or are not a fan of truffles, a good lobster risotto is also available.

I also had the sauted foie gras and it was nowhere near as delicious.  The foie gras was undercooked and it was not the best quality.  It was very broken and there were quite a few strands in it.  It was creamy but not that smooth.

The garnishes were okay.  I liked the crunch and flavor of the almonds.  I also liked the pineapple tart though it was a very small portion.  The quinoa was kind of just bland mush.

You can definitely see the difference between Le Cirque's foie gras (the first link) and Picasso's foie gras (the second link), which is much more refined, simple and clean (Picasso is also located in the Bellagio).

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=p8ao29A31ijNwDXuAxQxjA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/picasso-las-vegas?select=GHrwF6JC4xmm5KknR_UHYw#FmNSTUhS4p7qmbufGVNMYg

My entree was a butter poached lobster tail and the lobster itself was nicely cooked.  It was very fresh and was mostly soft (a little tough in parts).  I really liked the garnish of caviar--a generous portion and very fishy, briny and salty.

The base of the lobster was a vanilla emulsion and I did not like it.  The sweetness and the very pronounced flavor of the vanilla kind of ruined the dish.  The garnishes of cauliflower and broccoli were average.

There was also a side dish of pomme pure, mushrooms and lobster meat.  This was messy, but it was good upscale comfort food.

For dessert, I oped for the grand mariner souffl, but I should have ordered the chocolate souffl instead.  The baking of the souffl was very good.  It had a nice lift and it was airy, light and moist.  The flavor of the grand mariner was too strong.  It was a very powerful flavor and the strong punch of alcohol diffused any sweetness this dessert had.

The meal ended with some mignardises including a pretty good cream-filled profiterole (with a hard candy-esque topping), a blueberry financier, a lemon meringue tart (similar to the ones they have at Platine in Culver City), and a caramelized fig tart.

Service was good.  The food came out at a quick pace and the staff was pleasant and attentive.  I did feel the service was a little rushed at times; Le Cirque's service just did not have the smooth ease of Bellagio's Picasso.

Prices were high, but that is to be expected given Le Cirque's location.  The food is about in the same price range as Picasso and I think the food at Picasso is much more refined, elegant and exquisite.

Le Cirque is a decent French restaurant.  It reminds me of La Folie and Gary Danko in terms of menu items and quality.  I think you could probably have a satisfying French dinner here, but it will probably not be worth the high price (like most Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

I had this place bookmarked after seeing several delicious looking pictures being posted on yelp. Hubby and I decided to come here for dinner and we left full and satisfied. The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)

We sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the "Buffalo Chicken Wrap" priced at $10 and the "South Side Cheese Steak" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. 

South Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!

Happy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.

While there we noticed a promotion for "Slot August Nights" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company. Just ask your server for details.

***Picasso's food is not incredibly creative, but it is very nicely prepared (and the flavors are good)***

Picasso features a prominent chef (Julian Serrano) and many Picasso paintings throughout the dining room.  The paintings are not the only nice touch; there is an outdoor dining area that sits right on Lake Bellagio (large windows also give indoor dining guests a view of Lake Bellagio and the fountain shows).

The dining room was bigger than I expected.  It was not stuffy, but I did not like all of the design choices.  Seating was comfortable and I liked the color of the walls as well as the nice ceiling.  I was not a fan of the carpet (or the chair backings).  I think they were trying to embrace the Picasso theme, but it made the dcor feel out-of-date.

Picasso is a French restaurant and there is a tasting menu and a pre fixe menu (not much difference in price; tasting menu provided one additional course).

I opted for the tasting menu, which started with an amuse bouche of warm potato soup topped with crunchy almonds.  There was also a pheasant croquette garnished with prosciutto.  The soup was good.  I liked the croquette, but you do not get much of a pheasant flavor.

There were several complimentary bread options.  The raisin and walnut bread stood out the most.   There was a great mix of crunchy nuts and sweet dried fruit.  The very hearty bread also had a great crust and chew.

My first course was Maine lobster with micro greens, cherry tomato, avocado, celery, melon, and an apple-champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was fresh, light and refreshing.  I liked the lobster, which was lightly sweet, moist and tender.  While I liked the lobster, it did not have the softness of the lobster in the lobster salad at Vincenti (Brentwood).

My second course was a pan seared scallop that sat on potato mousseline.  There was also a port wine reduction.  The scallop was very good.  It had a great caramelized crust.  The scallop was also fresh, moist and soft.  I also liked the potato mousseline, which was buttery and creamy.

The dish as a whole though was a little underseasoned.  The port wine sauce did not add much and there needed to be more bold flavors on the plate.

My third course was the sauted foie gras, which was topped with almonds (the foie gras sat on brioche).  There was also a blood orange sauce as well as rhubarb and rhubarb puree.  This was a very good dish.  There was a great mix of flavors (sweet, salty, tart) and textures (crispy, creamy, crunchy).

I really enjoyed the foie gras.  It had a great outside sear while the inside was velvety, smooth and buttery.  The almonds were great.  The toasted brioche was a little too toasted (almost crouton like).  I really liked the rhubarb and rhubarb puree.  It was a great mix of sweet and tart and it went well with the savory foie gras.

My main course was the roasted loin of Colorado lamb, which was served with mint aioli, tempura zucchini, tomato, and ratatouille.  The lamb loin was very good.  It had a great outside color and flavor.  The meat was tender and juicy (great flavor).  There was a nice amount of fat marbling, but it was not too much.

The sides were pleasant and well prepared but simple and straightforward.  I liked the flavor of the ratatouille as well as the light crispiness of the tempura zucchini flower.

My dessert course was caramel roasted pear with warm hazelnut frangipane cake,  ice cream and crushed hazelnuts.  I really liked the caramel roasted pear.  It had a good flavor (the caramel was sweet but not heavy).  The pear also had a great texture--tender but not mushy.

The ice cream was creamy and smooth and had a good flavor (though I was expecting a more distinct flavor).  The frangipane was decent (kind of simple but thankfully not too dry).

The meal ended with petit fours.  The petit fours were pleasant--not as innovative or ambitious as the very good petit fours I've had at places like Cyrus (Healdsburg) or Providence (Los Angeles).

Service was very good--personable, pleasant, polished, professional, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but their tasting menu is less expensive than what you will find at some Vegas restaurants.  In terms of similarly priced Vegas restaurants, I thought the food at Picasso was better than Le Cirque, Michael Mina and Aureole.

Picasso is a pleasant and satisfying Vegas fine dining restaurant.  I do not think Picasso would compete well with top Bay Area restaurants because the food is not as ambitious or creative.  Still, the food is good and very nicely prepared, which makes it a good option for a special occasion meal in Vegas.

The Bellagio has its own free parking structure (self-parking).

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.

I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the "1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.

Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.

Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. 

I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.

It's sad that I didn't give Kyara a try earlier, as it is merely a few minutes from where I live. Japanese Tapas has always been a little intimidating to me, as I don't really know what I'm ordering a lot of the time. I've been missing out -

The food at Kyara is excellent, as far as I can tell. There is time and effort put into a lot of their dishes, along with quality ingredients. I've now tried nearly a dozen of their different items, though there are still many more to be tried. My favorite at this point was a simple chicken and rice bowl called Tori Meshi. Uncomplicated to say the least, but still very delicious.

The Chicken Garlic Ponzu is also truly tasty. It has strong flavors that jump out at you, but is unique enough that it is intriguing. Another excellent dish was the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad. The salmon is very lightly seared and the texture of the dish is amazing, as well as the presentation.

Some other highlights so far have been the deep fried cheese, which while straight forward, was tasty and had some nice variety of cheese. Their pork belly skewer is average, while the Negi Ma (chicken and green onion)  skewer was very tasty. The sasami (chicken breast) was not as good, as it really was just a piece of chicken on a skewer. I also tried the bacon mochi skewer, which, while interesting, wasn't necessarily that strong of a combination.

I would probably pass on the potato salad, which really was just that, and the Niku Jaga was good but also just seemed like sukiyaki. Still, there are many dishes that I would like to try.

It is definitely worth noting that their desserts are extremely good and priced very cheaply, in my opinion. The Yuzu Fromage Mousse is really quite amazing, as is the Green Tea Waffle, which is enough for 3-4 people and only costs around 5 dollars.

Service here is a little on the slow side, which is really my only knock on the place. A table was ready and we were asked to sit for a good 5 minutes for no real reason other than they had some trouble keeping up with the crowd. I'm not sure if that's a normal situation, or if they are short one or two servers during the busy hours.

All in all, Kyara is a very good and reasonably priced option for those desiring to try a multitude of Japanese-influenced flavors, and I see myself returning here many times for it's convenience to my location as well as its excellent food.

Tradition. 
Comfort.
Value.

These words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. 

Right away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.

We received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. 

I'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. 


Here's what we tried:

//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary 
The cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5

//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95
We savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5

//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95
This dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5

//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95
A dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalapeo slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5
*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! 

//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 
A traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5

All minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. 

I applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Scale of 1-10 (single visit):
6 Food
8 *Drinks*
5 Service
10 Atmosphere
4 Value

Holy shit, thank god I had a Groupon for this one.
As such, note that the above 2-star rating is *generous*.

To start off on the good: The space is really really cute & comfortable.  The patio has lights and trellised flowers and the indoors is perfectly lit and just feels good.  The drinks were also really tasty, and the service was pleasant.

However, despite all the pleasantness in the world, competence wasn't on the menu last night.  Among other things, i expect servers to a) take my order correctly, and b) know what menu items they are out of.

Well, no such luck.

Strike 1: Our server had to go check with the bar to see which "winter drinks" they were no longer making.  It was 7:30pm.  Do that before your shift starts, or maybe mgmt should update the menus, even if it's just with a sharpie.

Strike 2: He almost brought me the wrong drink.  The only reason he didn't is because of the extra trip he made to tell us which drinks were actually available.  "Okay, so I'll go put in your X, and your Y [from his first trip] is in as well." -- "Um, I ordered a Z." -- "Oh, I'll go change that."

Strike 3: When the appetizer came out, it didn't have the fried egg on top like we ordered.  It looked much different than I expected (which isn't a bad thing) so once I realized it was eggless, the food runner was gone, and 3 minutes passed and no sight of our server, so we just ate it.  He apologized and didn't charge us for the egg, which I don't expect took much effort because I doubt it was ever rung in in the first place.

Strike 4: After taking our food order, he returned to the table to tell my girlfriend that they were out of the Fettuccine.  For the love of god, know that shit *AT* the table!!  This turned out to be a problem, because there aren't many vegetarian options on their menu.

Which leads me to the food.  Why are there so few veggie options?  I'm not a veggie, but you should have a healthy selection of veggie options.  Some people need them, and some people just want them.  After getting my food, I was also amazed at how underwhelming it was considering the price.  People used to bitch that PastaBar was overpriced for what they got.  Have they ever been to Caffe Boa?  Caffe Boa's food was less filling, less flavorful, and more expensive than PastaBar's ever was.

The only exception was dessert: a Tangelo & Honey Twinkie.  This tasted excellent... but was still an astounding $9.

I was hoping that Caffe Boa would give me another reason to go to Mill, which I enjoy the liveliness of, but unfortunately not.  Thank god I had that Groupon....

Whenever I get the inkling to play poker, this is one of my favorite places to play.  The decor is ornate yet sophisticated, crowded yet intimate, intimidating yet accommodating.  Where else are you gonna be able to find a poker game in town where Johnny F-ing Chan is standing a few feet from you chatting with the floor manager as you sip on an expresso, proceed to call down an all-in river bet after flopping the nut straight, and throw a few chips from the two stacks of high society that you just raked in to order Thai food from a restaurant within the Aria resort to be delivered table side?   Sounds too much like a deleted scene from Rounders but inevitably a true story starring yours truly, thereby prompting me to pay homage to one of the great poker movies by throwing in a few related quotes from Teddy KGB.  

"Mr. Son of a Bitch, let's play some cards!"
Offering a variety of game options ranging from 1-3 no limit and pot limit Omaha to higher stakes in the Ivey Room where you will likely spot a recognizable pro on any given day, there is constant turnover of players ranging from all levels of skill.  There is also a daily no limit hold-em tournament that starts at 7PM where first prize typically takes in a few thousand dollars and the top 5-6 get paid out on a $125 entry fee. 

"Just like a young man coming in for a quickie, I feel so unsatisfied"
Need some distractions from the cards?  There are multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting various sporting events and the sports-book is a few yards down if one needs to place bets.  The room has an open structure where one has an unobstructed view towards the entrance for people- watching as folks heading to and from the nightclubs stumble back and forth.  Unlike a lot of the other smaller poker rooms, the majority of the servers and a few of the dealers here are quite easy on the eyes (just saying). 

"Want a cookie?"
 If you need to refuel with food, Five-fifty pizza is a few doors down for a nice hearty slice and the Jean Phillipe patisserie is also a short walk for gelato, pastries, and packaged sandwiches/salads.   If you want to stay at the table, you will be hard-pressed to find the variety and quality of dining in any other poker room in town delivered to your seat with a cheesecake factory-like menu that offers a smorgasbord of options from various Aria restaurants on the premises.  Just be sure your eating habits don't serve as a tell when you have a monster hand like Teddy KGB crunching his Oreos.

"In my club, I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please."
Complimentary drinks!  You can customize your coffee whether it be cappuccino, mocha, espresso served with a classy rock candy sugar stick in a hard mug (although you can request a plastic cup as well), or choose from a variety of sodas and juices including pineapple, watermelon, and  freshly pressed carrot (a few bucks extra), as well as Fiji bottled water, Perrier sparkling water, and I've seen a range of spirits ordered ranging from beer and tequila shots to red wine and cognac (these are the players you need to get in a hand with especially after they've knocked back a few, remember the words of Mike McD "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money").

"Hanging around, hanging around. Kid's got alligator blood. Can't get rid of him"
Be sure to check in with your Mlife card since 2-3 dollars gets credited to your card with every hour of play, which can help comp for some of the meals above.  A masseuse is also available at an hourly rate on the premises to massage your backside as you play  if your back starts feeling the strain of a long session on the felt.

"That's a position raise.  I call"
Pro-tip: the weekends can often get very busy with long waiting lists.  If you call the number on the the yelp page, they accept calls to be placed on the list before you arrive in person.

"Nyet! Nyet! No More! No! Not tonight! This son of bitch, all night he, "Check. Check. Check." He trap me!"
The poker room is located within a short walk of the self-park lot so be sure to park on the 2nd floor for the shortest path to the tables as well as to minimize your walk of shame on those nights you are delivered a bad beat or on tilt.  

"Respect is all you have left in the morning!"
For any poker player, this is a quintessential Vegas experience where you get the opportunity to partake in exciting gambling action, great food/drink, people-watching and celebrity sightings, and hopefully a cinematic story to take home regardless of where the chips may fall.

Who doesn't like secret gardens?  Especially secret gardens that are lovely, romantic with food that is charmingly delectable!   You don't even feel like you are right next to a large city with a farm and South Mountain as a backdrop.  

I made a reservation on the patio because my sister was in town from the Bay Area and I knew she would want to enjoy our warm AZ weather and watch the sunset.  Honestly if you are coming here I would just sit outside, the house is cute, but the patio is much better.  The server placed us in a perfect spot shaded by palms overlooking the koi pond and not far from the fire!  Gentlemen, talk about a place to bring a hot date, would definitely set the mood for me!  But, it was also perfect to laugh and catch up with the sister too!  

We ordered a cheese board to start and a bottle of Salneval Albarino to cleanse the pallet!  I HIGHLY recommend the Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese!  I am not even a cheesy kind of person, but I could eat a whole wheel of that stuff.  

This is going to sound funny, but I came to this lovely restaurant with a big black/purple/blue/violet eye-cheek from an accident and trust me for the last 2 weeks I had been getting domestic violence and thug looks from various 'service providers'...  Well our waitress Megan didn't even bat an eye at my whacked face and my glorious bruise was even on her serving side!  So extra bonus points for that, which is why I rounded my 4.5 star rating up to 5 instead of down to 4.

So after asking our poor server a million questions about the menu, because it is really hard to decide, as everything looks good and unique, we finally ordered.  I opted for the seasonal house special: hand made ravioli.  It was a spinach ravioli topped with an interesting lemon cream sauce, with almonds on top.  The raviolis were delicious, the sauce was quite good, and the almonds brought it all together.  I think I was expecting a little bit more POW to the dish, but it was still very unique and delicious.  

I have to say my sister chose the right dish!  The New York strip with Red Chimichurri Sauce is AMAZING!  The thing they don't tell you on the menu is it comes in a corn puree of sorts that is mouthwatering!!! See picture.  It sounds weird to go with a steak, but it completely made the dish and set that steak apart from your typical steak at a nice restaurant.  I was actually trying to talk my sis into one of the other dishes and she trumped me...I am glad she did!!  

The corn puree sauce was so good we asked the server what was in it and she said she would ask the chef who was in house.  She wrote the recipe on a note for us!! Sorry I promised not to divulge her secrets.  But the last ingredient was cute:  Love :)

If you are skimming just do the following:  Sit on the patio, select Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese on the cheese board, somebody order the steak.  You will come back for more and if you are on a date you will get lucky!

I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.

Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. 

Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. 

Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.

The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

***Olives is a nice upscale lunch option in Vegas; Olives also offers a great view of Lake Bellagio***

The first time I tried Todd English's cuisine was at the LA Food and Wine Festival.  His station put out a very nice plate of Asian marinated steak (great marinade; tender and juicy steak), buttery beet risotto and a great cold corn and cream relish.

After this, I was eager to try one of his restaurants.  I did try Todd English PUB next to Aria, but it was not that great.  Todd English PUB is casual gastropub fare.  His Olives restaurant (a version of his flagship restaurant) is not really fine dining or formal, but it is much more upscale.

The food at Olives was significantly better.  There was a complimentary breadbasket, which consisted of addictive flatbread crisps, flavorful caramelized shallot topped focaccia and just okay ciabatta rolls (accompanied by olives and two kinds of olive tapenade).

I started with the spring pea mezzaluna, which was heavily garnished with spring peas, haricot verts, mushrooms, baby pea shoots, Parmesan, and a truffle burro fuso sauce.  I really liked the spring pea mezzaluna (kind of like pea ravioli).  The pasta was very thick and had a good flavor.  The pea filling was good--creamy and lightly sweet with a good pea flavor.

Though there was a lot of stuff on top of the pasta, I liked it.  I think less stuff on the plate would have made the really good pea ravioli stand out more, but the mushrooms were good and earthy.  I liked the freshness from the pea shots and haricot verts.  The truffle burro fuso sauce was not too heavy or rich, but it was definitely a thick sauce.

With all the components on the plate (and especially several traditionally salty ones like Parmesan), this pasta dish was still balanced in terms of seasoning.  That being said, this was a dish with a few salty notes that popped.  I think if the kitchen is not careful, this can become an overly salty dish.

For my entre, I had the sea scallops, which were served over a roasted tomato caper risotto and topped with a shaved fennel and frisee salad (the plate was also garnished with green pea puree).  The scallops were good.  They were big, fresh, plump, and moist.  They got a nice caramelized outside on the scallops and they were not too salty.  One of the scallops was not cleaned that well (a little bit of grit).

I liked the shaved fennel and frisee salad, which gave some lightness and freshness to the dish.  I also really liked the green pea puree--sweet, great pea flavor, creamy, and very smooth.  I am not a huge fan of risotto with entrees (especially since so many places overcook the rice).  The risotto here was fine; it had a good flavor and was creamy; still, the rice was overcooked and did not have the bite it should have.

A lot of the desserts on Olives' dessert menu seemed like standard stuff.  I am not sure if Olives would be the best place for a creative and ambitious dessert.  I had the banana tiramisu and it was a satisfying end to the meal though it was not that special or distinct.

The banana tiramisu consisted of banana mascarpone cream, banana cake and a Kahlua sabayon.  The tiramisu cake was garnished with a chocolate sauce.

The dessert was creamy and mostly moist (the cake could have been a little more moist).  There was also a great banana flavor.  Unfortunately, the coffee flavor was quite mild.  You do not get that espresso-soaked cake/ladyfingers flavor here that you get at other places.

Service was very good.  My server was pleasant and friendly.  He was also knowledgeable about the menu as well as polite and attentive.  There were a few gaps in the meal; the first course should have come out a tad quicker.

Prices were not too bad for lunch.  Olives is definitely serving an upscale lunch and considering that Olives is in Vegas, the entrees (priced in the mid-$20s) did not seem too expensive.

Olives also offers a nice outdoor dining atmosphere for lunch.  I did not think their indoor dining area was that inviting.  It had a contemporary and comfortable dcor, but the lighting was too dim for lunch.  The outdoor dining area is great.  The patio overlooks Lake Bellagio (and you get a special fountain show--the first of the day at noon).

With the view and the comfortable patio, Olives is a great spot for outdoor dining (and unlike the outdoor dining spots on The Strip, Olives' dining areas feels much more private and relaxing).

The only problem with the outdoor dining area is that they allow smoking.  Fortunately, there was only one couple smoking, which was slightly bothersome.  If more were smoking though, I think it would have been an issue.

A lot of upscale restaurants in Vegas are not open for lunch, which increases the value of a restaurant like Olives.  The food at Olives is good--maybe not as good as some of Vegas' fine dining spots but definitely a significant step above the cafes serving lunch in Vegas.

Free parking via Bellagio's structure.

EAT, pretty simply put, how could I go wrong as I Yelped up a something to eat this morning for some breakfast before returning home from Vegas? 

I generally stay clear of the places that appear so sublime on Yelp, but I was hungry and I was biting on the the Yelp hook again for a relatively new place with a short track record. My GPS in the rent-a-car told me this place didn't exist WTF was this some kind of Yelp trick? I found it anyway a half dozen blocks down from the Fremont Street Experience downtown, nestled under an old apartment complex.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#1FLXhCFNGaHKlo7mePjUCQ  Maybe 707 never existed before Eat made her home here???

After feeding the meter across the street I crossed and hesitantly I walked into a nicely appointed, clean semi industrial, semi earthy space of a restaurant  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#5hwJW33twIKPbYqGXborAw  with only a few customers and was greeted by a tall dude (forget his name) with face full of jewelery, a punker hair-do and a dark gothish demeanor. He showed me to a table and got me some coffee right off. Nice guy.

As I read the menu I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore Toto, there were a bunch of menu choices that were out of the box and sounded very promising. http://eatdowntownlv.com/breakfast/

FOOD ORDERED:
Truffled Egg Sandwich Two farm-fresh scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon and smashed potatoes

WHAT I GOT:
Truffled Egg Sandwich and some country style fried potatoes. The sammy was great, yummy thick sliced bacon atop a couple of fried eggs laced with shrooms and some chives and a kiss of feta cheese crumbles on a croissant roll. This sammy was good! And the taters were well seasoned and tasty as well. 4.5*****STARS
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#atNQH5fb6TgXBd6UtOgXkw

The service was great too. Plenty of refills, checked on me couple times too. Had their s**t together.  4.5 **** Stars

I also briefly met Natalie Young  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#kz1WySQnziPX0GxnBQvwQA the chef / owner as she was kicking it with a few patrons at the table next to me. She seemed like a very nice and down to earth gal.

She explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. I can believe it if the Lunch and Dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. While a little pricey (still cheaper than the Vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.

This place is as cool, hipster, and the food is as good as you are likely to find in a local Las Vegas eatery. Its a local downtown eating establishment that's not on the beaten path when it comes to locale or food. This place is what most trendy LA places wish they were  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#lSlXZcBJk6tow9WEoEUcsw hip with legit with great food and real atmosphere.

I gotta try the chicken fried steak next time it looked awesome!

I'll be back, next time in Vegas!

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***

China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  

I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.

The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.

I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.

Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.

For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.

Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.

Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.

In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.

I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.

I believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.

TAP Sports Bar just opened about a month ago.  They are located in the MGM towards the back of the casino parallel to the Sports book.  A very nice open space with lots of TV's to watch all the games in action.  Definitely a good spot to go especially if all the chairs in the sports book is full.

They have a good menu with plenty of yummy eats and drinks.  It was kinda late when we arrived and had about 5min to get our order in because the kitchen closes at 11pm.  

Fries and Gravy ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-las-vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw  This bowl was huge.  It has fries and fried cheese curds, those are the brown pudgy looking ones.  The gravy had a decent taste.  Could have used a bit more of it though.

Braised Bacon Corn Dogs ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-las-vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#WaZNbNTffH30OujvBDx6IQ This one confused me a bit and was not sure what to expect.  Instead of a hot dog I felt like I was eating a stick of corned beef wrapped with bacon.  Whatever though it was pretty damn good so I was totally ok with it.  It had a really tasty mustard sauce that came with it that I really enjoyed.

Buffalo Wings ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-las-vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#xhsxeyv7jom3w1qGmfRqfw  These were finger licking good!  You can actually choose from 4 different sauces and the waiter recommended to stick with the Buffalo and we were glad we did.  I could have had another basket of these wings!  

This was probably not the healthiest thing to eat at midnight but hey were in VEGAS!!!

Eyes ~ Wow I get to eat all this so late at night!
Nose ~ Smells Yum!.
Ear ~ Still a few peeps hanging around.
Mouth ~ These are all pretty good!.
Tummy ~ I'm going to make you pay in the morning for stuffing me up at midnight!

What an amazing experience from start to finish! Locals are in for a treat and I have no doubt that word is about to get out. I'm considering myself lucky to be amongst the first set of patrons. 

I have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word, starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)

Unreal! These prices are too good to be true... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running, not walking, to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.  

Took some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park! 

Some things that I recommend trying are:

Ty Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)

SOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)

Beef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite, pictured.)

Rock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeo aioli and the sweet banana sesame)

Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)

Soft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite, pictured)

Crme Brle (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double, she knows all about it! *wink*)

If there's something you usually order that is not on the menu, ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not. 

I would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself, Mr. John Lee, came out to welcome us. He made us feel like true VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best. 

I have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire, mark my words! 

I'm eating there again tonight. Yep, it is THAT good!

Update: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently, one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease. Chef John Lee hooked up many options for her. My guests were so impressed! Thanks Soho Japanese Restaurant and John Lee for all the extra special things that you do.

To all previous Yelp friends who reviewed Carlos' Kitchen--THANK YOU!  I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.

We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.

The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!

Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  

Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!  And, what a fantastic and creative chef Carlos is.  He cares about his food and his customers.

My second favorite buffet is vegas!!! (#1 is Studio B)

I took Kimberly K's awesome advice to take advantage of lunch prices for dinner.  So basically this was my first stop driving into vegas on a Tuesday and we arrived about 30 minutes before lunch was about to end.
Got in for lunch price at $20 and got to eat dinner as well, which is normally $30.  Paying for 5 people, it was a $50 savings!

PRICES: as of 9/6/11  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=O5p34DZJZrd9YRIoHpREMQ

Breakfast : M-F 6am to 11am = $16
Lunch: M-F  11am-4pm = $20
Dinner Sun-Th  4pm-10pm = $30
Gourmet Dinner Fri/Sat  4pm-10pm $37
Weekend Brunch 7am-4pm  $25    (with champagne = $30)

The most important part for me is that they have a pretty good dessert selection : These were my pickings :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=aBragtXmC5EWj12o632S-A

They had: CREME BRULEE, soft serve, banana foster, bread pudding, cute little cone things, carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, tarts, flan. Ofcourse these were not superb desserts like u would find at jean philippes. But for buffet desserts, i think this is way better than most. Way better than Wynn buffet, which i thought was bad overall. Didn't see any chocolate covered strawberries tho. :( 

Meats and Seafood:
Kobe Top Round, Prime Rib, Ham, Roast Chicken, Turkey. 
(my fave was the top round)
Snow Crab Legs, King Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail. 
*crab was a bit salty and not super fresh. but it really didnt' stop anyone for getting heaping piles of it. 

Other stuff they had was Salmon Teriyaki, Miso Chilean Seabass, 3 kinds of mashpotatoes including sweet potato- my fave was the pesto mash potatoes. A few different salads, which werent' that great. pasta salads, soups, chashu bao, salmon and tuna sushi and poke, CA rolls, sliders (meh), pizza, mac and cheese, sausage

I've been to this buffet probably about 5 times over the years, and it's been pretty consistently good IMO. Unfortunately prices keep going up and lines can get ridiculously long. If it were the weekend, i would prefer going to SB, but if i'm here during the weekday, i would definitely recommend coming here for a late lunch/early dinner!!!

A fellow yelper suggested this place for lunch and I had been wanting to try it so she made reservations for us. At first when I walked in I noticed they were packed so was glad a reservation was made. I was seated at a half booth half chair type of table. I never mind these but in this instance I felt cramped. It kinda seemed like a space that was left over and they decided to cram 2 more seats into a corner. If the table were larger it would have made a better difference. I just know next time to request a different table since this one seemed like the only one like it.

The lunch menu was short and simple but had something for everyone. I decided to order the "Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese" that was accompanied by a cup of "Crushed Pea Soup w/Bacon Lardons" priced at $13. I was so pleased with it! The sandwich had such great flavor and I kept wanting more. The pea soup was simply delicious. I can't say enough about how much I liked this and I will for sure be back to order it again! The server was nice and kept checking on our drinks and how we were doing.

They have daily specials and I noticed they offer a kids menu. Some places offer you a mint or root beer candy when leaving but Honey Salt had salt water taffy! There is a fun guestbook before the hostess stand you can sign. If you feel like eating at the bar you can sit there and order from the menu as well but if there are any happy hour specials I didn't see any posted but there is a TV.  There is tables and chairs outside if you are wanting to enjoy the day should the weather be pleasant.

Do NOT board your pets here because THEY WILL LOSE THEM!!!!

My friend and I came to Vegas for Memorial Day weekend and she had to bring her dog Crusher, with us since no one could watch him back home in the Bay Area. She decided to board him here at Green Valley because she used their services before when she used to live in the area. 

We dropped him off before the weekend and when we came back to pick him up on Monday morning around 11:30, they told us they LOST Crusher around 9:00am when they took him for a morning walk. Somehow he slipped out of his harness and leash... I do not understand how that is possible. Crusher is a chihuahua/daschund mix, so he is a small dog, but the harness fit him perfectly. If he were to slip out, wouldn't the person walking him feel him tugging and struggling to escape? Somehow their story of him just simply escaping his leash made no sense to us. It seems very likely that whoever was walking him was not even paying attention to what Crusher was doing at the time...

They said they had been searching for him for the past two hours but had no luck. We were speechless... We darted out the doors and began searching for him ourselves for the next 5 hours. The staff insisted they were helping us find him but we barely saw anyone out there during the search. I mean, if I worked at that facility and lost someone's pet, I would not stop searching until I found it! They argued that they couldn't keep watch all day because they had a lot of things to do at the hospital as well, which is understandable, but they should have at least had someone out there helping us search for Crusher. They were the ones responsible for losing him, yet they were finding excuses to not be on top of the search. Later on we were told that Crusher was not lost at 9:00am, but instead he was lost at 7:45am. Regardless of what time he was lost, why wasn't his owner informed RIGHT AWAY?? They should have called her the moment he slipped from their fingers! If they called her sooner, we would have been able to head over there right away and search for him. Maybe we would have found him sooner if he heard his mom's voice pleading for him to return... Were they even planning on calling her to give her the bad news? We had to come in to the hospital for them to even mention he was gone..

So after searching for many hours, we decided to stay in Vegas for one more night just in case he was found. Tuesday morning arrived and there was still no news regarding Crusher's whereabouts. That morning we went back to Green Valley. They gave us a list of numbers and addresses of different shelters in the area. We called and visited a few of them trying to find him but still, no luck. Then at 1:30 someone called Green Valley saying they thought they spotted him around Sunset and Valle Verde. We immediately went to the area to find him, searched for hours, and still wasn't able to locate him.. Again, we didn't see ANYONE from the hospital helping us search for him. Time was running out and we had to return to San Francisco soon. We headed back to Green Valley and spoke to them about how disappointed we were that no one was helping us search. We had to head back home to San Francisco and we were worried that no one would bother to look for him once we were gone... They assured us they would not stop searching until they found him. 

That evening, we had to leave without Crusher. My friend was so worried about his current condition. It was so hot.. Was he dehydrated? Did he get hit by a car? Did anyone find him and take him in as their own pet? Endless questions but no answers.

She posted a lost and found ad on Craigslist with a picture of Crusher and where he was last seen. After we arrived home, she kept receiving e-mails from people saying they saw a dog like him around the CVS Pharmacy. She continued to call Green Valley to tell them to look for him there. They said they were looking but couldn't find him. It took one of her friends who used to live with her to drive all the way from Southern California to that CVS Pharmacy in Henderson to finally find Crusher. Amazingly, he was able to locate Crusher right away. Crusher recognized his voice and followed him. Although he is malnourished, he is alive and will reunite with his owner very soon!!

Somehow we feel that Green Valley did not follow through with what they promised. Yes, they posted up fliers and called local animal shelters, but we feel like Crusher could have been found sooner if they had searched harder. And this whole situation could have been avoided if the person walking him was paying attention in the first place. 

So, I do apologize for this long long review. But I want people to be aware of what happened. If it happened to one dog, it can happen to yours.

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

I shouldn't give this place a two because the description says, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Well, I haven't experienced better because this is my only experience with a male strip club.  

I should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  

Why do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  

A friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well, I'm rather busty, but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. 

So, we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us.  They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for, and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people.  This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable, especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet.  I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok.  I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad, but not sexy.  

After I was dance raped, I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender.  My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy, but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also, this is a small, small world).  So, I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots.  I had about three the entire time we where there.  Trust me, I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night.  Not only that, but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  

This is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark, but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into.  Thank God my brother answered and screened the call.  I don't even know what I said to him, but he told me I was pretty out of it.  Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. 

The next day.  I wake up in my hotel room with a start.  I have no idea where I am at first.  I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night.  This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in.  Luckily, he just happened to be there for the bachelor party, but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action.  Haha, sucker.  

So, apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before.  I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can.  It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair, but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around.  I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been.  Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in.  I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip, so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions.  This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what.  If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. 

I also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! 

Once they got me to the room, I was completely out.  I mean, dead to the world.  Well, until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor.  My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay.  So, I popped my head up long enough to say, "Be cool, bitch."  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.

My poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me.  He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing.  Apparently, I was completely non-responsive.  

The next day, I wanted to kill myself.  I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life.  It was HORRIBLE.  

In conclusion, I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks.  All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank, as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.

P.S.  I highly identified with The Hangover... for obvious reasons.

Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.  

I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  

The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).  

The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.  

All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.

When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!

This ranks high on one of the most amazing and unusual culinary adventures that I've ever had.

A friend tipped me off that this chicken place was opening this week.  I so wanted to go, but I had another gig, and figured that I'd miss out.  As it so happened, said gig ended just early enough for me to go right before closing, so the missus and I hightailed it to ensure that we got there before closing.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured "Why not", and bit into it.

o_O

It was amazing.  Super sweet, like cake.  I ate two pieces while the line trudged on.

As we got closer to the door, another staff member came out and started handing out copies of Flav's autobiography.  And now I had something to read while waiting.  People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  "If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken", he said, "you can come up and punch me in the face."

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

....

o_O

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a "bucket list" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.

This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas, apart from the lake front "1500" suite at The Bellagio or Villa #1 at The Mirage.  I have stayed at least 5 times at this point.  The service is impeccable, the styling by Tony Chi will inspire you, and the rooms are flat out amazing!  The good news is that the price isn't that outrageous for Las Vegas.  You could certainly spend a lot more for less at other properties.  I know I have.

To start, the hotel will pick you up and drop you off at the airport as a complimentary service.  They use a fleet of Maybachs, so if you have never been in one, here is your chance.  It is very luxurious, but the ride will be short since the Skylofts are on the top floor of the MGM Grand, which is right next door to the airport.  If a Maybach isn't available, they send a limo, but I have never had that happen.

Once you arrive at the hotel, an agent will meet you at the car to escort you directly to your room for check-in.  This is a nice touch as I loathe waiting in a hotel lobby for check-in with a ton of people.  They walk you through the MGM Grand lobby into the VIP, where there is a private hidden bank of elevators that go directly to the top floor of the hotel without stopping.  This is nice because the MGM Grand elevators (there are 6 in each bank) are always FILLED with people and stop at nearly every floor.  When you need the elevator, you just walk past the crowds, through a set of double doors, and into a private elevator to the top.  Stay at the MGM Grand one time and you will understand why this is so valuable for a pleasant overall experience.

When you get the the Skyloft lobby on the top floor, the design will immediately embrace you.  This hotel looks NOTHING like the MGM Grand below.  It is an entirely different property, and it shows.  There isn't a theme so much as a lot of natural elements like earth, fire, water, etc.  You feel different once you enter, and it holds throughout the entire experience.  The designer created everything down to the uniforms worn by the staff.  As you walk by staff members, they stop what they are doing, stand up, and greet you.

When you get to your room, a butler is waiting, complete with white gloves, a tray, and a complimentary cocktail or freshly squeezed glass of juice.  The check-in is quick and requires a few signatures.  Then, the butler will show you around your apt. and the amenities (if you are there for the first time).  It takes a minute to figure everything out because there is a lot of stuff.  I have always stayed in a 2-bedroom unit, but they also have 3-bedroom and 1-bedroom spaces.  The butler will offer to press your clothes or provide any other services you may need.

The 2-bedroom is approximately 3,000 sqare feet on two levels.  Downstairs, you have a dining area for 8, a living room next to the dining room, a pool table room (sometimes a foos ball table), a movie theater with surround sound and a powder bath, a second living room, a breakfast nook with coffee machine (the kind that makes an assortment of drinks using packets) and a sexy entry foyer with a stairway to the upstairs.  The entire place is luxury and you will feel special just being there.

The upstairs has large art installation common space between the two bedrooms.  One room has two queen beds and a huge, spa-style bathroom, and the master has one king bed with the even better spa-style bathroom.

The entire place is completely teched out.  There are Lutron lighting controlers with buttons in the entry that say "day, night, mood, etc".  One click and the entire apartment is set.  There are also Crestron controllers in every room and Bang and Olufsen butterfly stereos in the bedrooms and movie theater.  There are iPod docks in nearly every room as well, and the shades are motorized.  The list goes on and on...

The master bathroom has a huge steam shower with about 9 heads including a rain shower head, a negative-edge soaking tub with led lights and jacuzzi jets, a powder room with bidet, televisions inside of the bathroom mirrors, a dressing area with full length mirrors and lovely storage cabinetry, a scale, a separate bathroom music controller, a large flat screen over the tub, and fantastic robes, towels, and spa products.  The guest bathroom has everything I just listed minus the steam shower feature.  It also has a table with 4 chairs in the dressing area.

The entire place is setup to party.  The best part, you can go crazy in here with the music on full blast and nobody can hear you.  Likewise, you can't hear anybody else.  It is like a Vegas dream come true if you hate hearing the doors of your neighbors open and close during your entire stay.

I am running out of space, but there is a lot more to share.  There is a service entrance to the apt. where the staff can enter your unit and deliver things like the best room service EVER without bothering you.  I could write for an hour about the food options.  5 stars!!!!!

Jinya, whatever culinary wizardry you got going on in the kitchen, keep it up! My tastebuds thank you. 

Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth. 

I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly. 

Here's what I recommend: 
- Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled "seasoned egg" is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen- 

Toppings added: 
- Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend. 
- Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend! 
- Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta. 

We also tried:
- Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.  

- Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender. 

Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places. 

I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way? That's crazy! I can't wait until next time!

I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins. 

Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody. 

I ordered a "S'mores Martini" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a "Garbage Bowl Salad" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left! 

The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.

P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.

P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud.

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

There's a new burger boss in town - Hooligans is the epitome of the gourmet bar burger! I hear a lot of talk about the strip having some of the best burgers in Vegas, but if you're a local, I would highly recommend that you give this new place a try! 

Insider: Bruce was the former Chef (genius mastermind) of Braddah's Island Style and he stole our hearts with his unique and crazy flavorful sauces. Being that we are sauce junkies, we followed him here (plus his crack sauces are here...) Well, the guy can also cook! He is now the executive chef here at Hooligans, so his menu screams flavor and his unique go big or go home philosophy.

Let's be real, my boyfriend and I came here to eat! We ordered "The Big Mass Burger"($11) - This burger is a beast! It's the biggest and most epic burger I've ever eaten in my life. Ok, imagine this: a massive 2/3 pound burger, glistening in all of it's glory, stuffed with 6 slices of melty gooey-ooey cheddar cheese and 6 slices bacon, finished off with more bacon, melty cheddar cheese oozing all over the place, sauted onions and mushrooms, and...wait for it, in a white wine garlic butter. (!!!) whoa there fancy pants. My mouth just trembled. It's a burger's dream of a burger.

First bite: I made a peck in it (that's how huge it was) and with that tiny peck, I got angry at how good it was! It's the type of delicious where you'd want to curse. Super juicy, seasoned expertly, and did I say juicy? Crazy juicy!!! All of the ingredients danced and sang together. The meat was seasoned like a pro, the grilled mushrooms and onions were super sweet and caramelized, the bun was grilled to perfection and soaked up all of the buttery meaty bacon-y flavor! It was madness. The burger is a masterpiece.

It's simple, Bruce cooks with so much passion and uses high quality ingredients. You don't taste frozen or dried out food here, it's all fresh! He also gets his beef shipped to him from Australia. Hey, we can definitely appreciate a guy that firmly knows what he wants. Also, bartender Dave was great! He was one-man-show'n it that night, but he was efficient and very friendly. He really offered us top notch service.

Other important details:
- Happy Hour 3pm-6pm and 12am-2am: Awesome deals! Half off the $6 food menu and $2.25 well drinks!
- Margarita Drenched Chicken Fajita Quesadillas with Brucie made pico and sour cream ($8) - I strongly urge you to add a side of Bruce's signature sauces (my personal favorite is the guava habanero), try them all and decide what's your winning combo. Now, dunk the juicy and flavorful quesadilla into the sauce and enter food ecstasy!
- Jalapeo Fries ($6) - (they are not potato fries) Super crispy and airy, light tempura battered jalapeo halves, lightly seasoned with cumin and served with Bruce's special cilantro ranch. It's not spicy, but kind of sweet and addicting. Bruce knocked that cilantro ranch out of the park! I'm a ranch snob and this is a grand prize winner. So rich and creamy! 
- Inferno (habanero) poppers ($6) - Great bold flavor...but, be careful, they are deathly spicy! We are avid spice eaters and eat raw thai bird chili peppers on the daily, but these are in a league of insanity. Let this be your warning: Use extreme caution when eating them.
- All of Bruce's famous crack sauces are also available on the menu to enjoy with your burger/ meal for $1 a pop. Try one, (try them all): raspberry sauce, pineapple lime, guava habanero, white noise ghost chili, coconut colada pearl. (pro tip: I love dipping my burgers and fries in all of them, but my personal favorite is the guava habanero)
- Pyrat Candy ($6) - salty pretzel, caramel, chocolate bark..Need I say more? Very naughty.
- If you're watching your waist line and burger intake, they also have lighter fare like grilled chicken, salad and sandwiches - if that's what you're looking for... at a bar. But yeeeeaaah, about that, just go all in and try his carnival creations, they are delicious! 

From one food fanatic to another, this place is a keeper. The entire Hooligans crew cared about our satisfaction and we left feeling 100% taken care of. Come try them out, you won't be disappointed. 

P.S. I'm planning and creating a UYE for Hooligans in the near future! Special yelp menu to be announced! Awesome burgers, refreshments, company, conversation, shenanigans. Let me know if you want in! :D~~

I'll have to say this for the Rooste...I've never had a better time when food that bad was involved.  The good times start as soon as you walk in and are shown to your table.  The restaurant is downstairs from the entrance level, so you have your choice of using the steps or a sliding board.  Trust me on this, take the slide.  You won't believe that you had forgotten how much fun they are.  Once you take a selfie, it's time to hop up from the slide and head to your table.  This involves walking past the main stage where a country-western band is playing.  As we walked by they were playing Margaritaville.  It seemed so out of place, yet at the same time made sense.  Once you get to your table, if you are wearing flip-flops the first thing you'll notice is that you have sawdust in your toes.  This truly is a sawdust joint.  With that taken care of, the seven of us slid into a horseshoe-shaped table ready for a celebration feast.

A few people in the group decided to indulge in an adult beverage, and the look on their faces when their scotch on the rocks showed up in mason jars was priceless.  They should have known better; the pewter dinnerware was a dead giveaway of what to expect.  And with that it was time to order appetizers.  It was a unanimous decision to go for the fried rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries.  For $18 you get a platter of mostly fried cactus, along with a few pieces of rattlesnake.  It's a total gimmick, but everyone does it just to say they ate rattlesnake.  The snake pieces tasted like deep fried clam strips, but without the tartar sauce.  Nothing to write home about, but glad I did it.

As we waited for our entres to arrive, we were served salad for the table in a huge, woven salad bowl.  It was your basic bagged iceberg mix, but loaded with so much dressing that it was one of the highlights of the night.  For dinner I decided to go with the steak and enchiladas platter, and added on a baked potato and jalapeno/bacon mac & cheese.  According to the menu the cut of steak was sirloin, but I'm pretty sure it was more along the lines of either a loafer or a work boot.  I could barely get my knife through it.  And trying to chew it was next to impossible.  I was hoping to have more luck with the enchiladas, but all you could taste was corn tortillas and canned enchilada sauce.  No one else at our table was pleased with their entre either.  But the mac & cheese was very good.  

With dinner out of the way, they bring you complimentary cotton candy.  Score!  At this point, a tableside magician also showed up.  He was pretty damn impressive, and I was sitting right next to him and couldn't keep up with the sleight-of-hand.  He was at our table for about 15 minutes, and we enjoyed every second of it.

Finally it was time for dessert.  Earlier in the evening, a table near us was celebrating a birthday and a bunch of the staff came out to sing to them.  One of my buddies texted me from across the table, and said we should prank one of the other guys in our group and have it be his birthday.  A quick word with the waitress when nobody was paying attention, and the plan was in place.  For $15, you get served an eclair with a birthday candle that was easily big enough for 8-10 people, along with the singing staff and one person playing the triangle.  The beauty of the plan is that the prankee was seated dead-center, and had no way to escape.  My absolute favorite part of the night was when he started protesting that it wasn't his birthday, and one of the waiters looked him dead in the eye and said "It is tonight!".  So he sat there, with an oversized cowboy hat planted on his head, and played along like a trooper.  You also get your picture taken for the website.  And the true bonus is that the eclair was pretty damn good!

And with that, it was time to bid farewell.  Like I said earlier, I had an amazing time there.  It's like a southwestern dude ranch mixed with Medieval Times and South of the Border.  It's just too bad that the food is horrendous.  A 5-star entertainment experience mixed with 1-star food should average out to three stars.  But at the end of the day you are there for the food, so I have to come in at two stars.  One star if you don't ride the sliding board.

This is my first visit to the new hotel and casino.  On my way from work to the hotel, I called up reservations to ask what my dining options were at this time of the night (arriving at 8:30p) and was told that I had Ditka's (steakhouse), the 24/7 Cafe, and the food court, where I could find Panda Express, Fat Burger, and Los Reyes de la Torta.  As soon as I heard "Los Reyes," I knew where I would go for dinner.  :)

After studying the three menu boards overhead (a shorter list of their regular selection of tortas, aka sandwiches, and tacos) and concentrating on the tortas board, I considered two options: Cubana and the Carne Asada.  I ordered the Cubana (ham, sliced roasted pork loin, melted cheese, jalapenos, onions, and minus the avocado, and served with refried beans) since that was what grabbed my attention the most.  I was told my wait would be around 10 minutes, so I went to the Players Club to get a reprint of my card, should I ever get the itch to gamble during my stay.  (I found out the unused free slot play I'd received when I first applied for my card years ago was only good for the first 24 hours, so I was not able to get a re-issue of that free play- darn!  However, if you play nice, you can always get something comped.  :)  Thank you, Patrick!)  After getting a new copy of my card, I made a quick stop at the Square Bar for a glass of wine, and then headed to LR to retrieve my to-go order**.

A styrofoam box with my name on it was waiting for me, and while I dropped off my claim ticket, I asked where I'd find the utensils and was told it was at the cubicle next to me (couldn't see it because I was approaching the pick-up section from the left and the divider kept me from seeing the utensils, condiments, wet naps, and napkins, which were to my right).  The tables are cafeteria-style, so just grab one that looks clean.  This sandwich, which came with ridged potato chips, was HUGE!  I expected refried beans goop, but these were actually whole beans scooped onto the bottom of the sandwich, upon which sliced ham, white cheese, sliced pork, tomatoes, sauteed seasoned onions, and jalapeos were added.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-laveen?select=XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ#XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ  The telera roll was toasted and buttered- so delicious!  It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing, and I am accustomed to eating light at every meal.  I ate so much that I don't think I'll need to eat breakfast before heading for my morning swim... With Dunkin' Donuts coffee and Munchkins to tempt me, however, I may just have to force myself to have a few bites!  ;)

**  I should've just gone with "dining in" option, since I knew that I didn't have a refrigerator in my room.  However, I had planned to look for a bar to order a drink, since LR didn't serve alcoholic beverages, and I didn't want to leave my food open to the elements.  Thank goodness I went with the boxed option, since there are flies in the cafeteria-- disgusting!

My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said "yes" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.

Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all "eff it, we're starving, let's eat".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  

We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:

Chef: Did you just get married?
Us: No.  It's been over 6 years.
Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.

(a few minutes later)

Chef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?
Wife: No it's not.
Chef: Well why else would he take you here?

HAHA

(later)

Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.
Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!

So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called "The Shit".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  

Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?

I liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.  Lots of reviewers have raved about the fish to rice ratio and it's great.  I would nigiri my way to fullness if we ever came here again.

Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list of places to go in vegas and i actually got a little depressed at the end of the meal when i didn't feel that 5 star feeling... I had been drooling over the pics posted by friends weeks in advance and I found myself enjoying it, but 5 days later, i can't really think of too many dishes i would go back for... 
But no surprise to SY, i would still give this place 4 stars. Mainly because compared to most of the other Vegas Buffets, they do have a cool concept of serving most dishes tapas style,a large selection and you can't beat the price. $29.00 for dinner is a great deal!!!
Things i liked: cute sweet potato fries basket: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=iPghhy9N4azg0lP_S5HrkA
Salad (yes salad): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=hdhBFzkgK6B6235Cd9EpDA
That they have a mac and cheese bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=M2_4E_aQ9CKhPjH1w-2--Q
and surprisingly the brussel sprouts were deelicious. 
Loved eating out of the little pans : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Ym-lY0eK698v546Q_AzDTg
Crunchy tacos were good.

Sad they didn't have the raved about pork belly bun and XLB. They only had 3 types of sushi and they were all generic rolls. Crab legs were small crab claws. I had Bone Marrow for the first time- thumbs up. 
The desserts looked beautiful and were plenty : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xDoLAU2S10POWue58tlXBw
and i grabbed a whole plateful :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=zxZDmDpWsDs2rcaWQa0ZEw
But the only thing i really liked was this lemony jelly dessert thing that was served inside of an eggshell topped with a baby macaron (mac was not great tho). Gelato was yum. Chocolate covered strawberries are always nice. 
I did enjoy the desserts here more than Wynn Buffet. But i remember liking the Bellagio desserts the best (but that was years ago)

A little disappointing overall, but service was friendly (our waitress took the time to take pics for us and make conversation about our trip), everything was beautiful and how much fun was it to take some pics in the shoes and by the dog statues around the way.!

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

I'm not planning to come back, but wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to go.

I've visited twice now with mixed experiences. I thought the food was as expected from a Fox restaurant. Not exactly to die for, but definitely better than a Chili's. My aversion to loving this spot is the menu prices and the extreme wait during a lunch "hour", and I use the term hour loosely there.

Had I not been out to lunch with my boss already, I would have likely had a stern "talking to" when I got back to the office two hours later. We had six people at our table and took about five or so minutes to peruse the menu. The staff was quick to deliver our drinks, but four salads, a burger, a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really, almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me, by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.

The burger I ordered was on the menu at $12, not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it, but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably, she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger, now $18 after fees, tax, and tip, is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(

I did; however, like the food itself, the company, the location, and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong, and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.

On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf, the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans, but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO, especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup, really, ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly, I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour, but outside of that, I'll likely just stick to "grabbing a drink" or two with friends if I'm ever back.

Scottsdale used to bill itself decades ago as Western Town USA, or Cowboy Town USA or something like that, to convey a clean, wholesome, western spirit to itself, and bring in tourists to see it's, well, Western-ness. 

Not surprisingly, Scottsdale was built, grew, and expanded on old ranch lands, and the names of them are still in the buildings and developments off Scottsdale Road. 

McCormick Ranch....
Gainey Ranch.....
Noodles Ranch......

Wait a minute Noodles Ranch?
Huh? 
Have you lost your Noodle?

No, actually, I found it!
At Noodles Ranch, off Scottsdale Road! 

This Vietnamese restaurant has been here for 6 years, not long after I left the Valley of the Sun in 2004 back to California. If it was here back when i was, I would have been a regular! 

Unlike the divey Viet diners of San Jose or Westminster, where decor is dominated by plain tables and standard issue stackable red chairs, and service is by a grumpy old Viet dude who doesn't speak English or smile, Noodles Ranch is perfect for Snotsdale, er Scottsdale.

It has a very pleasant decor of painted walls, tasteful artistic symbols of Vietnam artwork, large red, hanging upside down paper umbrellas,  4 cooling ceiling fans, a decorated cashier counter in front of the kitchen, and better quality table and chairs than their Little Saigon counterparts. 

Scottsdale prefers looks  over substance, so it likes nice decor in favor of good food, as exampled by the many large, formula restaurants with million dollar decors but mediocre food. And remember, PF Chang's, that popular faux Chinese chain, the epitome of Decor upstaging Taste, was started right here in the Valley  of the Sun. 

So seeing the tasteful decor, and seeing all the non-Vietnamese in the restaurant, kept my expectations very low on the food taste-o-meter. 

But I was pleasantly surprised! 

Now I lost count, but this is close to the 100th different Vietnamese restaurant i have eaten in all over the country in the past 4 years! 
(see my Wanugee! lists for Pho and Vietnamese for details.)
So I have tasted good and bad and everything in between. And granted, I was starving from not eating all day, and here it is 7:00pm. 

But when I ordered Cha Gio (egg rolls), the 6 little crispy rolls came out beautifully plated on a large, quality made and decorative platter, and unlike most orders for this in those dives, which usually come out on a plain little white saucer plate by themselves, here, they were accompanied by several large leaves of romaine lettuce, pickled and julienned slices of cucumber and carrots, sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and of course Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to dip them. 

Now most of the customers in here at the time would have dipped the rolls into the sauce, and probably poured the leftover sauce over the veggies, mixed them, and eaten them like a salad. If this were PF Changs, that is what they probably would suggest. 

But I took the leafy lettuce, put an egg roll on top of it, and sampled the veggie ingredients on top of that, rolled up the lettuce, and dipped all of that fresh tasty goodness into the Nuoc Mam. This is much like how you might eat many other Vietnamese dishes in a Vietnamese restaurant, be it Nem Nuong, Banh Xeo, or even parts of Bo Bay Mon. 

So I was impressed and happy with the refreshing mix of fresh veggies, crispy rolls and tasty fish sauce exploding into my mouth! Loved it!

So I figured that was for show, however, to impress the Low Fan (outsiders) with a $5.95 fancy appetizer, with Scottsdale pizzazz. 

Mais, au contraire mon frere! 

The Pho Tai Nam ($7.50) I ordered was very good! I always try the broth first, and this broth had a very rich, complex flavor! Perhaps a little sweet for the Low Fan, but very beefy, savory, and not too mucked up with masking ingredients to distract from the true flavor. The meat pieces were whole and higher quality than most I have had, with good tenderness. I had to ask for the separate condiment dish, where I mix the half Hoisin and half Sriracha, to dip my meat into, so as not to destroy the flavor of the broth. 

I was smiling after this meal! I even called up my Viet friend in San Jose, who could tell I was smiling over the phone, which they usually only notice after I have had good, authentic Japanese sushi or tasty and cheap KBBQ!

I would recommend this place highly! It is a little more expensive than those $5.50 bowl dives on the coast, but the decor and quality of food, and the service from the owner, all combine to make a quality experience. 

They offer all the usual Viet diner foods, like Goi Du Du, Goi Cuon, Mi, Com, Bun, Bun Bo Hue, etc. They also offer two of my faves I will have to try another time, Banh Xeo (crispy pancake) and Canh Chua (sweet-sour lemongrass soup).  

So this is perfect for Scottsdale, with the nice decor, but with the added bonus of tasty, quality food! They even play smooth jazz, something you would find in another Scottsdale staple - the SPA!

3.5 stars!  The crew decided to try a new sushi spot tonight.  After looking around Yelp, we decided to stop here since we intended to go grab boba afterwards at a nearby place.  After bracing ourselves for a strip mall sushi joint, we walked in and our dinner adventure begins.

It's a small cozy restaurant with a few modest tables and some seating at the sushi bar.  It's sparsely decorate with the personality of a goldfish.  Oh well.  We're here for the food anyways.  From what I could tell, there was one sushi chef making the rolls, two waitresses, and perhaps someone else in the back area prepping stuff.  We were told to sit anywhere we want and the most unenthusiastic waitress [we'll call her "unhappy child"] and her trainee served us.  Do you ever get that feeling that your server just doesn't care about her job?  Yeah, that's totally the vibe her.  The trainee was super friendly though and seemed more than willing to answer any questions and refill our waters and tea.

10-minutes of decision making later, we decided to order a sushi boat set and some Happy Hour rolls on the side.  Set A for $35 comes with nine pieces of sashimi, five pieces sushi, and two "special rolls."  When asked what the special rolls were, the unhappy child just shrugged and told us, "whatever the chef wants to make."  Oookaaay...  I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure there's actual names for the rolls but she was just too lazy to ask.  Whatever.

After eating a small cucumber salad with imitation crab and too much dressing, the rolls all came out and shortly after, the boat!  I was starting to get excited again, after the unhappy child dampened the mood, upon seeing thick cuts of sashimi and our rolls.  I decided that after eating some HH salmon rolls and a few avocado rolls, I wanted my first bite from the boat to be some salmon sashimi.  I love salmon.  They were so generously thickly cut but it wasn't fresh.  No cantaloupe smell but still smooth.  It was kind of a let down and the rolls were unevenly cut!  Everything else was pretty much the same:  big portion and/or cuts, not the best quality.  I do like how they offer fresh wasabi.

$20ea. before tip for the three of us for a $35 sushi boat and four Happy Hour rolls.  Cheap on the wallet AND on the quality.  One pro is, if you want to eat on a budget, Happy Hour is all day, every day, and runs between $3-7 [if you think about it, that just means they have really cheaply priced rolls and there's no real specials here].  Not the best sushi in the west valley but okay prices for okay food.

You're probably asking yourself, what in the world does "Sekong by Night" mean? Well, the answer is, oooh just some classic, popular Cambodian song title that the owner is obsessed over. :)

As previously mentioned by another fellow Yelper, Sekong does exude charm.  In fact, most of the artistic, decorative items that is seen in the dining room is a straight import from mainland Cambodia (ie. table cloths, paintings, sculptures, and other artworks).  Obviously, the owner wanted to not only deliver authenticity from a cuisine standpoint but also historically and culturally.  They did a magnificent job in creating a nice visual display to sort of educate first time consumers of Khmer cuisine.

To get an idea of what Khmer dishes are like, I always say they're a cousin to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.  Although, I think they just share ideas or possibly just steal from one another.

One prime example of idea sharing that you might find in a Vietnamese menu is the Luc Lac.  And actually, this creation was French inspired.  It's basically steak meat that has been cut into cubes and sauted to a tender perfection fused with caramelized onions and garlic to give a richer taste.  The dish usually comes with a side of white rice and a fresh salad that has been lightly soaked in a sweet, citrus, vinagry dressing.  Its fantastic when done right!  In fact, I really enjoy Sekong's version! Its a must try! [Recommend]

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=yeZLfWYl0CMkhNM9T73i_w

Sekong also serves tasty sandwiches like the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  I have only tried their grilled beef.  From what I recollect tasting, it was meat marinated in a savory, lemon grass.  The baguette was very toasty and had a soft interior while the pickled veggies were fresh tasting. [Recommend]

And the cultural similarity theme continues! They also serve a crispy crepe-like dish that encompasses pork, shrimp and bean sprouts called, Baynchaiv, traditionally a finger food.  You take your lettuce and create a wrap and dip it into home made fish sauce. [Recommend]

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=dmpDwgYQUk68LqY3tGx3fw

Loat Cha, my other go-to dish, are these 1-inch round rice noodles drenched lightly in soy sauce and then pan fried served with fresh, crispy bean sprouts, green onions, and sliced beef topped with one egg.  [Recommend]

Now, the chicken wings with a side of rice is quite tasty.  Last time I ordered one, the chicken came out nicely crisped with a hint of peking flavor, which is a notorious marinade for Chinese roast ducks.

As for snacks and specialty drinks, I've had their tempura sweet potato and banana, and grass jelly drink.  All were excellent.  The tempura snacks came out super crispy with a fresh tasting interior.  If you are unfamiliar with grass jelly, it is basically semi-bland jello with a slightly sweet, grassy flavor, but in creating a refreshing drink, jello are cut up into tiny cubes while adding ice, sugar and honey.

The one item that has bothered me for awhile now is the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also the counter to Vietnamese Pho.  The only reason why I have hesitated for this long is, admittedly, due to the exotic-ness (ie. pork liver, heart, tripes, etc).  As soon as I can grow a third ball, I will attempt it! Just kidding, I will eventually.

The menu is not as large but being new to the food scene, they are looking to start off small and expand as business blossom.  

By now, you may have already read about the lengthy wait, awkward location, and whatever shenanigans have you not, they are still working out the kinks and are continually listening to feed backs.  

Pricing is very reasonable and competitive with the other Southeastern Asian power houses in the Valley [$5 - 10 range].  I will continue to be a regular here and add more updates as I try more items.

Ok..... Unlike any other yelp reviews I've done I will keep this shorter than usual but as serious as possible......  hmmmm.......

Sterling Brunch is gotta be one of my favorite buffets in all North America.  (Taiwan has some awesome ones but Yelp is not there yet)

Sterling Brunch is located in Bally's Las Vegas and is only available on Sundays from 9:00am - 2:00pm (Typically by reservations only but you may get lucky)  

They got the typical buffet fare ranging from various seafood, poultry, steaks, desserts.  Here's the list:

Seafood:  clam, mussels, salmon (sashimi/cooked), oysters, lobsters, fatty tuna, Uni, king crabs, and  Cavier!  (So the sashimi is flown in from Japan weekly, Lobster are baked half of a 1-2 lbs lobsters, and Cavier is all you can indulge!!!  with those little blintz to go with it! YUM!)

Poultry and Steaks (meat):  rosemary roasted chicken, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, beef wellington, Beef Oscar (fancy!)

Dessert:  lots of melt in your mouth heavenly desserts that you simply cannot miss out on any of it...

Extras:  Lobster omelet, Gazpacho soup, fresh fruits, other seafood prepared cooked such as seafood Bouillabaisse, etc...

Had my favorite server "Eduardo"!  Awesome guy who worked at the Sterling Brunch for 30 years.... really nice guy who actually prepared us a seafood extravaganza on ice while we get our food!  Tipped Eduardo really good afterwards as he was like the best server we ever had!  (by the way you actually get 2 servers one helps you with everything else the other one make sure your drinks are always topped off perfectly!  Simply awesome!)

Of course.. with a meal like that.. it took us 3 hours to finish but of course that was enjoyed slowly....  Man.. lots of lost lobsters in my stomach and stuff.....Just way too much good stuff...........

Oh oh... get this.. while at Sterling I got this guy who was in front of me wanting Cavier... so when he got some from the nice little Japanese lady who was serving the fresh raw seafood he kept asking for more....The lady wasn't angry or anything but instead, took his plate, opened up a brand new like 120oz of cavier and literally slapped on top of the plate.... In a very nice way!!!  Everyone was floored when they saw that and the big man was a "VERY" happy customer....Seriously.. that Japanese lady was so nice she gave me a bunch of UNI after that as well!  LOL!  Shout out to Eduardo and Little Japanese lady...

Finally... forgot to mention... you want water... it's all Evian only.... FREE!  Then champagne is also complimentary.. which they served only Pierre Jouet!!!  WOW!!! I'm in heaven yelpers!!!  (That was also the reason why we were there for 3 hours.. had about 5 bottles of PJ for about $50 per bottle.....)

The cost is about $85 without Tax and tip.... but I'm telling you... BEST MEAL I'VE HAD EVER!!!!!!

Sterling Brunch.... I can't wait till the day we meet again..................

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

The Noob's guide to a $20 massage at Bali!

If you guys reading this are like me, you would consider yourself very INEXPERIENCED when it comes to massages in general.  And of course, you've heard plenty of stories about the shady Asian Massage parlors in Vegas LOL.  

Since I am now an expert (jk only been one time lol), I will HELP you out and let you know what to expect!



1)  I showed up with no appointment, but was promptly welcomed and walked to the back.  Maybe during prime time, you might have to wait, but I had NO WAIT on a Thursday around 630pm.  Maybe if you enjoy a particular masseuse, you could schedule an appointment with that person, but since it was my first visit, I only showed up with a dumb look on my face lol.

2)  There are no upsells or uncomfortable requests for additional money.  There were no options, no choices.  No drinks or products to buy.  You walk in for a massage, and you drop a $20 bill on the table on the way out.  Simple and CHEAP...I like that!

3)  I was walked into the back into a large community room with tall cubical-like partitions set up  (BTW, there were places for me to CHARGE my phone).  It is very dark in there, but because it is not a private area, you should probably leave your clothes on, which brings me to my next point :

4)  Wear COMFORTABLE clothing.  I came in with a T-shirt, Jeans and tied tennis shoes, but I should have came in a tank top, shorts, and sandals.  They rub this very low scented lotion pretty much everywhere, so you don't want that crap on your good clothes, as well as them getting rolled up and wrinkled.  Your hair gets all messed up too...don't plan on going out lookin your best when you're finished.

5)  Once you get your area, take off your socks/shoes etc, and relax....maybe put your phone on silent.  My masseuse was there after about 5min with a bucket of hot water for my feet. 

6)  The massage itself : Probably depends on your masseuse for the most part.  Mine was a middle aged lady with a bit of meat on her, and was the perfect "STRENGTH" I needed.  I am a wuss...I don't need anyone breaking my back or gettin super deep-tissue on me, but if you do, ask for it!  As well as once you are on your chair...TELL EM if they need to go easy or harder on ya.

7)  Mine started off with my forehead, hair and scalp, temples, behind the ears (OMG YES!) and then to the neck.  Shoulders, arms and hands were next, to the feet/calves/thighs and then to the back.  I would imagine I could have asked for more or less time in any of the areas, and it would have been acceptable.

8)  My massage lasted about an hour and fifteen from sit down to leaving.  I never noticed her checking her watch, but she kept me BUSY pretty much the entire session.  I felt great right after the massage, and felt a lil beat up the next day.  Nothing crazy, just like a good workout at the gym.

9)  On the way out, she offered water and sat at a bench by the front door to get her tip I presume.  Drop your $20 bill at the front, and then your tip to your masseuse. 

10)  As for the TIP, that obviously depends on your masseuse, your overall experience, and your personal pocketbook.  I won't tell you what to pay, but my experience was wonderful, and I would have personally felt cheap droppin a $5 bill for an hour of hands on work.  I spent $10 and she seemed happy...maybe if it was enlightening, I would have tipped more, but for a great massage, I think $10 was fair.  Still at $30 that's crazy cheap!  I might come here once every week or two!



I know most of this is common sense to the seasoned veteran, but I can't be the only one that has been living under a rock!!

Hope some of this helped the fellow noob!  I know it would have helped me if I would have read this before my first visit :P

Now go get your $20 massage!

I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.

The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?

About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.

We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.

The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.

The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.

The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.

This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!

My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.

Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. 

Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. 

We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. 

This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!

I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.

The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:

Buddy's Caprese

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti

Zeppole

The next day I at the following:

The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!

Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. 

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. 

Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. 

They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here.

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

Hand-pulled noodles...enough said!

No, seriously...they are the star of Beijing Noodle Cafe and it would be a crime if you didn't order them.

My trusty Yelp app reminded me I was in the neighborhood and not only did we recently read about this restaurant in the local paper, but Paul Y. was raving about place to the Husband.  

As soon as I checked in, I realized fellow yelper Andy T. was just here and he quickly sent us a message telling us what we had to order!  

Located in a strip mall, this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant is quaint and simply decorated with pictures of the menu items and hanging red lanterns.  Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.

We were given a lunch menu - on one side featured lunch specials, but the other side was where the specialty noodles were offered.  We shared:

* Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles in a very light aromatic broth with wood ear mushrooms and sliced beef.  It was very flavorful and we were quite impressed.

* Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles with a stir-fry of eggplant, tomatoes and garlic sitting on top.  Again, very good and quite rich.  

Although both dishes had the same noodles, they were showcased quite differently in broth versus sauce.  Once you eat a freshly made noodle, it's hard to want anything else.

While we waited for our order, we inquired about when the demonstration for noodle pulling takes place.  The waiter told us that the chef was out, but usually during the evenings.  The chef came in a few minutes later and he started making our noodles.  It was quite impressive and definitely entertaining.  At that point, the female owner explained more about the different sizes of noodles offered (small, medium or large - although she recommends medium), and that they the hand cut noodles into water as well.  (If you've seen Bizarre Foods, you know what I'm talking about here!)  She also mentioned their appetizer dumplings as being made to order.  We initially thought they weren't offered at lunch because it wasn't on the lunch menu we were given and per another yelper's review.  On the contrary, it IS available!  Sweet!  So we added:

* Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce ($4.95) - Twelve little handmade morsels sitting in a deadly chili oil sauce.  They were fresh and light, and not your average wonton.

* Pork and Chives Potstickers ($4.95) - They came in a set of six that were pan fried and just filled to the brim with pork and chives.  It also came with a dipping sauce, and you can really tell the freshness of this potsticker.  They told us it takes 8 minutes for them to make it, but I think it took less.

We're loving Beijing Noodle Cafe and we think you will too!  Be sure to ask the friendly lady owner for suggestions because she is more than helpful and willing to please.  You'll find out taking out-of-towners here for sure!

One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall dcor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe. 

The first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.

The Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.

The Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta. 

The Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.

Another item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.

These meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish. 

For drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.

The food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.

We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area. 

MENU:
Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL

Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more

SERVICE:
Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly

FOOD:
Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!

We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.

PRICES:
Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, "we need more cow bells!"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).

Debbie Downer:
Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.

As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said: 
"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go."  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: "I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again."

Oyster Bar is a no doubt a hidden gem in Las Vegas, from what I heard there's an another location in Harrah's but price is higher and probably more crowded since is in the strip.  One thing I really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location. The casino cigarette smell is very strong and almost unbearable.

Our group came here in a weeknight, there is only two group before us but the waiting was over 30 minutes long.  There are maybe around 20 seating at top of that the cooking expect to take another 20 or 30 minutes.  The bar setting is a kitchen like those in a ramen shop except you can see the whole kitchen.  Food was careful prepare and you see they not rushing make your food and really take their time and not to avoid short cuts.

Pan Roast and some other dish there is a charge of $5 extra per person if the food is been shared, and you cannot do takeout either.  However, you can take back the food if can't finish it.  They gave you dining roll, which are warm and soft.  We only order two item, one is the full serving of Oyster and the second one is the Combo Pan Roast.

The oyster was fresh and mouthwatering, juicy and you can really tasted the flavor.  It was day and night quality compare to the oyster found in Bacchanal Buffet. The Pan Roast was delicious and was well balance in term of the soup; it wasn't heavily tomato flavor, the soup come with lobster, crab, and shrimp.  There was little bit of lobster meat, and decent amount of crab, but the shrimp won me over, it was good quality.  

The price is far cheaper than the Harrah location but with more limited selection.  What it matter is the quality of food is not compromise here.  So if you are tired of eating of buffet, this would gave you a totally different taste bud.  Just aware expect a wait and the atmosphere is not as pleasant.

When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!

My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!
Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    
 
As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? 

Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!

Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  

Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. 

Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!

Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  

Trio of Caviar 
Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. 
Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  
Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       

Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.

Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. 

Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.

Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. 

Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!

If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!

They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.

I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience
of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. 

But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!

Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!

Shame on me for not eating here sooner! Vintner Grill is in a business complex and can be easy to miss, but you will not want to. I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. 

If cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.

Out server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the "Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the "Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. 

Vintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends. VG has a private party space and also offers catering.

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

I am being generous with my star because I love the pizza at this place.  Where to start with this place?  My girlfriends and I went in and the place was empty.  The service was a bit slow but the guy behind the bar, Jazz, chatted with us after we pulled conversation out of him.  I mentioned we were locals.  He seemed uninterested.   

We fell in love with the decor and all the fun items in the room.   I loved the fact that we had the spot to ourselves & the decor,  so I called my husband and his business partner to join us.  They met up with us and we tried the pizza.  

We had one that had chorizo and were blown away  by the flavor so we ordered another pizza.  As we were waiting on the food a camera crew showed up.  After a time of them setting up equipment they asked us if we would be willing to be on camera for Bar Rescue.  We agreed.  Thank goodness we were there or they wouldn't have had anyone to show on the shoot.

A guy with blue hair showed up and was hanging behind the bar.  He was rude and leaning on the bar, watching what the crew was doing.  I asked him if he should clean up or mess of empty plates, dishes and napkins, and he said no he wasn't on the clock.  He laughed and moved to be closer in the background of the camera shot.  I got his attention again and said, "Don't you take pride in your work?  The empty glasses and trash are in the shot.  Show me where the trash can is and I will clear it up."  After some reluctance he helped me clean up the mess.

My husband struck up a conversation with Jazz and found out he was one of the owners.  Later we found out that a guy who was watching us from the corner was the other owner.  When we left we said we would be back for the pizza.

Two weeks later my husband and I came in. Jazz was working and had no recollection of us.  How do you forget 5 locals who spent hours at your bar and eventually a camera crew making your place look good?  He didn't remember us so he barely talked with us, instead it was a Friday night and there was a group that came in that seemed to take his attention.  We got our pizza but refills on drinks came so slow that we were tired of waiting and decided to leave. 

Once outside there was the group that had come in and Jazz.  A girl called out, "Why are you leaving?  Stay the dancing is abut to go off."  We politely declined but were shocked at how again the place had such slow service and the owner seemed to be more interested in hanging out than making sure customers were happy.

We are gluttons for punishment I guess, because we had some friends in town and took them here for pizza.  They had seen the Bar Rescue show and wanted to try it.  We walked in and there were 6 people at the bar.  (6 on a Friday night happy hour time.)

We found a table and I walked up to the bar to order food and drinks.  Jazz was working again.  He was the only one behind the bar.  I ordered drinks and my friend got his food order out.  Jazz then turned his back to us and started making his way around the bar again.  Checking on people and chatting with them.  He came back after checking the bar for drinks.  He gave us our drinks and I said excuse me.  But some new people came in and sat at the bar and he was gone again.  My husband was on the phone and called out, "Get me a Diet Coke please." I said loudly in Jazz's direction, "I'm trying but he hasn't gotten my order yet."

After a while he came back and said, "Did you need something." I explained he hadn't gotten my drink and food order, only my friend's order had been completed.  He said, "Okay well what do you want?"  I ordered the chorizo pizza again to which he said, "Oh I care about the safety of my customers.  There was an issue with food poisoning at Firefly.  Did you hear about that."  I nodded dumbfounded.

"Ever since that has happened I quit.  I have substituted it with sausage.  You will like it."  He said.  I wanted to call BS because the Firefly incident had happened in May or late April.  I had been to this spot twice in less than a month and they had it, but at this point why argue.  I was just happy to have my order taken.  I rolled my eyes a bit and noticed a zombie arm was gone on the wall from the decor.    Where it had been was a grey patch and holes where the nails had once been.  (Mind you this is a black background.)  How hard is it to get a ladder, slap some black paint on a spot, and make the focal point of your bar look somewhat okay?

We got our food but as before our drinks were empty.  When we asked the lady that delivered our food about our drinks she said, "I think Jazz is working on that," and disappeared back in the kitchen.  My husband tried to get drinks.  Jazz said he was busy and we would have to wait, as he had the hose in his hand. (We ordered waters and diet cokes.)  I give up this place has the worst service, music, and now what was good pizza is average. This place is a joke, don't go.

So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.  

We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. 

I ordered the "Penne Arrabbiata" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the "Baked Lasagna" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! 

You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up "Party Pans" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!

I believe you need a lot of sophistication to enjoy Japanese Curry. It's just these small little differences with the spices that separates  a J-Curry place from being "good" and "great". And, I believe that JAPANESE CURRY ZENBAYASHI has achieved Greatness. 

This is a rare Japanese restaurant where they pay attention to the smallest details. For example, today the Rakkyo was perfectly cut in a distinct geometric style, which made every single piece look identical in size and shape. At first, I thought I was seeing things but eventually after watching Mr. Zenbayashi working so carefully in the kitchen, I came the conclusion that they spend hours before the store opens preparing everything to look beautiful and artistic.

Unlike similar restaurants, JCZ will refrigerate the condiments such as Tonkatsu Sauce, Rakkyo, and Fukujinzuke. They wait till a customer arrives and then they bring them out with new clean serving spoons. Other places around town will merely keep the condiments sitting out on the table all day long with the same serving spoons which had been touched by many dirty hands. But, you won't find that problem here. This is the most spotless and clean restaurant I have seen in Las Vegas.  Even the bathroom looked like no one had ever used it. 

Just like INABA, this place prides itself on having a dish that not only tastes great, but has tons of health benefits. They have a homemade Gram Masala which is a combination of about 15 spices such as Turmeric, Coriander, Black Pepper, Cumin, Cardamom, Fennel, Japanese Chili Pepper, Ginger, Garlic, Paprika, and many more. Unlike Indian Curry, J-Curry is lower in calories and fat content. It also has anti-oxidents, digestive benefits, blood cleansing, and even anti-aging benefits. 

I actually came here by accident today, I spent most of the day loitering at Jen G's place of work.  After about 3 hours of bugging her, she told me to "BUY SOMETHING OR GET OUT!", so I went straight to JCZ! ...Just kidding. Actually, the true story does involve me loitering at Jen G's place of employment, but we had a conversation about Kabuto, and both of us agreed we should go there and give it another try. I actually didn't like my last visit to Kabuto on account of being spoiled by Urusawa in LA. But, I ended up going over there anyway  to make a reservation. While I was in the parking lot, I noticed the JCZ sign.  David Y had recommended the place to me earlier, and he told me that it was exactly what he used to get in Japan, so I gave it a try. And Dave was right, it was the best. I don't know why people would rather eat at overrated Monta when JAPANESE CURRY ZEN is only a 15 second walk. And the best part of JCZ is that it doesn't have a 2 hour waiting list, uncomfortable seating, overflowing toilet, hipsters and emos reciting poetry, and non-japanese cooks who cook the eggs in the back alley(read my review on Monta to understand that better). And that's another thing that makes JCZ great, it's 100% Japanese staffed. Sure, I actually know Chinese and Filipino Sushi Chefs who make some Japanese ones look like amateurs, but the point is that it's always so unique to find a J-restaurant that is 100% Japanese staffed.

The best thing on the menu is the Pork Tenderloin Curry. Do not confuse this with the normal Pork Cutlet. The Pork Tenderloin Curry will not be on the main menu. You have to ask for it specifically. Today, the cook put so much attention into making sure the cutlet was fried perfectly. The color was beautifully golden brown, and the texture of the meat was so juicy and soft that I ended up eating it all in less than 5 minutes. 

This was the best service I have ever had as a 1st timer. Sure, there are some Japanese owned restaurants that treat me better, but that's because I've spent a lot of money there. For example, when I walk into "Sushi on Rainbow", it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert De Niro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they open the door for him, save him  his usual seat, and everyone gets whatever he wants before he even has to ask. That's how good some places treat me because I show up regularly, I treat older Japanese workers with a lot of respect,  and because I'm f*cking rich I tend to leave giant tips. But, even though this was my first time at JAPANESE CURRY ZEN, they already were treating me like I had spent over $1000 here. And of course, even though I only spent like $10.00 on curry I left a $20 tip. And the server earned every penny of that because it really was the best service I've had in years. 

JAPANESE ZEN CURRY is a small independent business, not a million dollar bankrolled J-restaurant. Even though there is a rumor that this place is owned by the Mon-group, the server told me that it's just not true. This is a small business that needs the support of the Japanese-American community here in Las Vegas. So, I encourage all LV Japanese residents to come try this place out and support them.

It's places like Forequarter that make me wish "hipster chic" was a category on Yelp... really. It's so full of cool even the cuffed slim red pant and denim shirt unbuttoned like I just don't care I was wearing made me feel sort of lamesies in a sea of hip and happening. Seriously, everyone who eats there is hip. The bar is hip. The tables are hip. The plates are hip. It's hip that they have this fine-ish dining setup going but use paper napkins [1] and mismatched silverware [2]. It's hip that they make ice cream to order! [3] So hip I need to footnote this review, and that's hip. But don't fret if you don't sport swagger, the place is accessible for those that wear glasses because they have to and don flannel because it's practical. 

We arrived around 7 and were told it would be 30 minutes for a table. NBD, there are plenty of seats at the bar and a cocktail menu that'll take even the surest of imbibers time to get through. I landed on a delicious apple brandy cocktail that I snapped so you can see it and read all the deets. Just as soon as our drinks arrived, maybe 5 minutes after we arrived, a table opened up. And this folks is when ish gets real. 

Forequarter has a tidy menu of 12 or so items. They range in price from 4 to 17 bucks and all are meant to share. I think. I mean I get bored after two minutes of the same thing, so I think all dishes ought to be shared. We started with a charcuterie plate, a special that night which came with Genoa salami, two kinds of mustard, giardiniera, sliced bread and a fennel apple salad. It was amazing. I wish their was more bread to sandwich the plentiful amount of meat, but I knew we had more coming. Mushrooms were next, four kinds of wild fungus mixed with some greens and toasted bread... we'll call those croutons. ;) [4] Next up were the lamb meatballs served with perfectly cooked lima beans. What do I mean by perfectly cooked? I mean al dente; nice chew but not raw. From there we moved on to the squash cavatelli, the standout winner. Take a fun pasta, add some crispy pieces of squash, grated cheese and a fried egg and life is good. We rounded out our meal with a rich chocolate ice-cream that was pretty bomb for ice cream. It was served with a raspberry fruit leather and the best almond cookie I've ever eaten. Don't go there tomorrow for it. They rotate their desserts every night [3]. 

All in all it was an awesome trip and I'm excited to go back. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant and liked reading every option on the menu, and I can only guess as the weather cools, some warm and cozy things will find their way to Forequarter post fall. 

[1] I used to gripe about paper napkins and now I sort of feel like a. I'm wiping my mouth on the thing, do I care if it's cloth and b. I have to think it's much more green to go paper than to go cloth and use harsh solvents and water to clean. So I say viva paper. 

[2] My dessert spoon was just like a set we had growing up. I wanted to steal it, but then I thought, "I'd only have one!" Not "It's wrong to steal" but "what would I do with one?"

[3] How do you make ice-cream to order? Nitrogen. The base is made that day and contains egg, so it's more of a custard when it starts. An order comes in, nitrogen cools the custard and makes for a thick and creamy texture, and tada... delivered to your table is a cool creamy treat make seconds earlier. They aren't stuck with a bunch in the freezer at the end of the night like oh I dunno everywhere else that serves ice cream and keeps it on hand. And they can get through a base in a night (because it rocks) and swap in a new sweet treat nightly.

[4] It's ripped, it's toasted, it's bread. And their tongue and cheek play on Corey's favorite carb was noted. Bravo 4qtr.

***Bellagio has many iconic Las Vegas elements like the fountains, their seasonal gardens, the popular Cirque du Soleil show O, and high-end cuisine; these features make Bellagio a must visit to at least just take a look; however (on my visit), my room was not as nice as other upscale hotels I have stayed at on The Strip***

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Breakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11
Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16
Dinner M-Th 4pm-9pm $24
Seafood Brunch Sat/Sun 9am-2:30pm  $34
Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts,

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

Another ramen spot, this one located right next door to Bachi Burger.  Might be hard to find if you're not looking for it as signage is only on the front door.

First thing we noticed was how clean the store layout was.  Everything was nicely done and had a place for it.  The only weird spot was the bar seating.  The window to the kitchen is much higher, so you're actually facing a wall should you choose to sit at the 'bar'. 

The Husband ordered the Buta-san Ramen ($9.50) with Nitamago and Toroniku Don Mini Rice Bowl ($3.50).  He was initially going to do just the ramen but the waitress did an up sell and for only three dollars more, we got a little rice bowl.  The 'Heavenly Pork" had plenty of meat in it and the stewed pork rice bowl was very tasty.  He preferred the noodles at Shoku versus a few other ramen places we've been to in town, although he wasn't quite as impressed with the broth.

I had the Miso Ramen ($8.50) with Nitamago and Ikura Don Mini Rice Bowl ($3.50).  It's not a bad deal with the add on rice bowl and egg for $3.50.  I found the broth to be quite creamy, although I did have miso in mine.  And it was more than enough food with my added ikura rice bowl.  I had a good amount of meat in my ramen as well.

They do give you the soft-boiled egg on the side here, which I am on the fence about.  I don't particularly like it on the side because the egg is cold.  But then again, the creamy egg yolk doesn't leak into the soup right away.  I guess I could always put the egg into my soup to warm it up.

We also really enjoyed the Benishoga that's available on the table.  It's made in-house and boy, is it tasty!! The Little Guy was loving it as was I! 

Service was good - they were super attentive about making sure our water pitcher was filled and everything was fine with our lunch.  We were pleased with service.

Overall, another good ramen place in Vegas that is definitely welcomed.  We'll be back!

02.10.13 Update!
They offer frequent eater cards now!  Buy 10 ramens, get 1 free!  (Lobster ramen not included.)  We ordered the exact same thing this time around and this time they put the egg in the soup.  It did sit right on top, so it wasn't submerged in the soup yet.  The Husband's Buta-san Ramen had less broth in it this time around too and he had to ask for more.

This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their "over the rainbow salad" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the "Spencer Steak" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  

Say hi to the pig heads outside!!

I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entre was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entre alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called "Bacon Bar", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the "Dining Area", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.

Avoid this place. BY FAR THE WORST GENTLEMAN'S CLUB I'VE BEEN TO IN VEGAS! 

Wife and I went to Vegas a few weeks ago and usually we visit one of the Gentlemen's clubs we know we enjoy. The Cab driver insisted on Sapphires claiming it was the "Worlds biggest with plenty of seating". We figured sure why not. Some clubs in Vegas its hard to find seating, so when he mentioned the place was huge and seating was not a problem we figured it was worth a shot to try a new place.

BIG MISTAKE. 

After paying the $40 cover to get inside we're greeted by a gentleman with two dancers next to him almost like they're next in line for the next group that walks in the door. Seemed awkward to us. Both girls, pretty in their own regard, were not our type and I was hoping he wasn't going to try and throw them at us. 

As we approached him, he asked us how many were in our party, and I told him 4. He gave us one look and said go ahead and walk in with no other information. As we walk down to a large room full of tons of empty chairs we notice EVERY SINGLE TABLE has the word "Reserved" on it. We see there is a second room that is completely empty with the same signs. We look over to the bar and notice its shoulder to shoulder packed.

My initial guess is that they don't allow you to sit down in this place unless you pay additional money to sit in one of their "Reserved" seats, but we were not quite sure yet. Anyways, we walk up to the extremely crowded bar area and order 4 drinks. Like others have stated its about $14-$16 a drink. I saw a girl ask for some water and they gave her the tiniest bottle and it was $10. She almost flipped her lid. The bar was a mad house every one was just there standing staring at the dancers on stage. Also since the bar is perched up they could see all the "Reserved" tables with the patrons getting lap dances.

The over crowding of the Bar became to much so my wife went back to the gentleman who told us to just walk in and ask him about all the reserved tables. When she asked what the story was with those he said "Go get your entire group and we can talk about pricing". My wife again asked if he can simply explain how this all works and rudely the douche replies "Go get your group and we can talk about pricing". 

Needless to say we were done. So let me get this straight, we pay $40 to get in, then before taking 5 steps in to the place we were to be confronted to pay additional money to sit? If not our only option is to be shoulder to shoulder with everyone at the bar. And should we choose to pay for one of your "Reserved" seats, we get the pleasure of everyone at the bar gawking at us while we enjoy our personal dance?

This place is a joke. This is one of the first times I have hated my experience at a gentleman's club in Vegas. The other couple we brought it was their first time at a gentleman's club so he had to apologize on behalf of Sapphire's and tell them this is not how normal clubs function. If anything they've just experienced the worst of the worst. We ended up going to one of our favorite clubs and spent a lot of money and enjoyed ourselves. Unlike Sapphires, we spent it willingly and not forcefully. Please don't make the same mistake we did, there are plenty of other clubs that are a thousand times better than this god awful establishment.

This is what I get for being lazy.  I know there are plenty of good places to eat after hours in Las Vegas, but I decided to dine here after watching Carrot Top's show simply because I was too lazy to go find something better.  The 24 hour Pyramid Caf located on the casino floor of the Luxor was quite the popular spot when I was there as there was a constant line of patrons waiting to be seated.

I liken the restaurant to a Denny's based on its menu.  They serve items such as all-day breakfasts, salads, burgers and sandwiches and a few main dishes.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is all pretty friendly even though I noticed quite a few of the buspersons lagging in their step and just standing around and doing nothing while there were multiple tables to be cleaned off and countless patrons waiting for a spot to sit down.

After a ten minute wait I was seated.  I'm not complaining, but they sat me (dining solo) in a table for four while tables for two were available forcing groups of three or four to continue to wait for a table.  The whole seating arrangement just seemed way out of whack.  I got a nice waitress though who constantly smiled and checked up on me multiple times.

I ordered the New York Steak dinner and asked that it be cooked medium.  The dinner is served with fresh seasonal vegetables which turned out to be steamed carrots and broccoli and a choice of potato.  I chose mashed potatoes and made the mistake of saying yes to gravy.  The wait for the food was about as prolonged as the seating process.  In the meantime I was brought a basket with two warm garlic rolls and four pats of butter served cold and hard.  The bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=Ji_LeplLxwpK_0wCAN9n6g) was flavorful, but it was not fresh as the center was kind of firm instead of being soft.

My steak dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=xVshpLhrKF23IUVFmNqt2g) didn't fare any better.  The meat was unevenly cooked as half of the steak was served medium-well and the other half was well-done.  I hate well-done steaks!  I wouldn't have minded had the entire steak was medium-well since that part remained tender and juicy.  Trying to cut into the well-done meat with only a semi-sharp steak knife proved to be a task as the entire table shook.  The huge serving of mashed potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=bOshUN8Fs5iGod0KBTGG1Q) might have been okay had it not been drowned in the super salty brown gravy.  The best part of my meal ended up being the steamed broccoli.

Pyramid Caf, no thanks!  Next time I won't be so lazy!

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.

A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.

We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.

About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.

The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.

Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.

Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.

Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.

About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.

Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.

Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ

Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

***Bouchon's brunch is a good and not-too-expensive alternative to Vegas' breakfast buffets and their chicken and waffles is a good place to start***

This Bouchon location at The Venetian is open for breakfast Monday thru Friday, dinner nightly and brunch on the weekends.  I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.

Bouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.

For brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.

I went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).

They served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.

The bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.

I also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).

Service was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.

For brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).

This was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.

There is a free parking structure at The Venetian.  The free parking structure has elevators that conveniently take you to the Bouchon restaurant without having to walk through the casino.

The Sparklings is one of the newer restaurants to have opened in the southwest area, courtesy of the owners of Soyo and Oyshi, which are just down the road.  Walking in, it's hard to not be impressed with the dramatic transformation this space has taken.  I almost felt a bit under dressed with the ornate chandelier dominating the open eating area and a bit concerned pushing my stroller in with a crying baby inside. We had our choice of seating and opted for a corner spot to minimize any distractions.  (I noticed the generous amount of high chairs available, which to me encourages a family-friendly restaurant.)

With a quick glance at the menu, we ended up just ordering appetizers.

* Crispy Gnocchi "creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts" ($7.50) - This was good, worthy of making this a meal by ordering two. (Update! I actually did this the following week and it was too much for one person. It's pretty rich, and two orders to yourself is quite a bit. And my gnocchi wasn't as 'crispy' this time. In retrospect, 'crispy' may be a bit misleading. It's more 'browned' than 'crispy'. Nonetheless, it wasn't as 'browned' in the to go order.)

* Grilled Octopus "soy marinated" ($7) - Three little octupi sat on the plate along with some greens.  I like grilled octopus in general, so we liked this dish.  It can be a bit daunting for those not wanting to see the head of a baby octopus.

* Seared Diver Scallops "lemon beurre blanc" ($7.50) - I didn't realize this dish had other items on it besides scallops, so was confused by the texture in my mouth when I thought I eating scallop. I guess along with the scallops were tater tot like disks.  The sauce was a bit fruity.

* Truffle Parmesan Fries "sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce" ($6) - It came with two dipping sauces and the chunks of garlic were falling off.

* Portobello Fries "lightly breaded" ($6) - This also came with two dipping sauces.

* Roasted Beet and Apple Salad "arugula, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette" ($8) - We like beet salads, but it seemed like this salad missed a little something.  They did shave some Parmesan cheese on there, but maybe it needed more nuts?

* Clam Linguini "surf clams, roasted garlic, garden herbs, Italian parsley & white wine extra virgin olive oil broth" ($13) - We took this dish to go for my mom.  She's a big fan of clam linguine and the first thing she noticed was the amount of clams.  She gobbled up the dish and even saved the sauce for the next day.  (She said it was good, but there wasn't enough for the price.) (Update! The Husband obviously liked what he saw when we ordered this for my mom. So the following week he got an order to go!)

Service - The staff were attentive, perhaps even too attentive.  I appreciate more than less, so I can't complain too much.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so they were coming around a lot to ask how things were and if we wanted to order more.  The owner (one of the partners) came around to see how we were doing too. I appreciate when the owners take an active part in their new business ventures because it can show a genuine interest in their clientele, especially if they become regulars.  He mentioned that this was a family-friendly restaurant, which we do appreciate (and noticed a kids' menu available too).

Overall, we like The Sparklings but are a bit confused.  It's very upscale in appearance, but a mix of casual in the menu.  I think they can actually expand on the menu a bit more, and perhaps they will with time.  But for the time being, we just couldn't find anything in the entrees that interested us.  (Items ranged from sandwiches like Philly Cheese Steak ($8.50) and Shrimp Po Boy ($8.50) to pastas, salmon and meats, ie. Rib-Eye Steak ($25) and Filet Mignon ($25).

They do offer a happy hour in the lounge/bar area from 5 pm to 10 pm daily, which means discounted drinks.  Only those over 21 years of age allowed into the restaurant after 11 pm.

***Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill showcases several good starters and entrees with generous portions, but the menu hardly changes; it is good option if you have never been, but if you have been to Mesa Grill, a return visit might leave you disappointed with the restaurant lacking the ambition to challenge itself and try new things (you cannot really blame the restaurant though given its popularity as well as customers' satisfaction with Mesa Grill's signature dishes)***

I have been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill a few times and it consistently delivers tasty and well prepared food.  Unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  That is the case with a lot of Las Vegas restaurants (for example, Picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  Still, almost the entire menu at Mesa Grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.

The familiar menu has pros and cons.  What it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and true.  In addition, most guests come to Las Vegas rarely and would likely only dine at Mesa Grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  On the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; Mesa Grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.

I started with their tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale.  It is a popular dish and for good reason.  The tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  The shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though I personally would have preferred it to be spicier.

For my entree, I went with their New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Unlike the shrimp and corn tamale, this entree was incredibly spicy.  The pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  There was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).

The pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  The pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  The sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the corn tamale from my starter.

My dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  It was very similar to Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  The cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  The cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a Ralphs or Vons).  There was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.

Service was fine.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  I felt the staff could have been more attentive.

Prices are actually not that bad at Mesa Grill.  Prices are very high, but that is common with most Las Vegas restaurants.  At least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.

The dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  It is a very comfortable dining room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  There are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  Given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.

There are definitely some good (and even great) things about Mesa Grill.  They have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  If you have never been to Mesa Grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you have been already though, Mesa Grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.

Mesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace.  Like most major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both complimentary self and valet parking.

Without Godzilla's review, I would totally not even known about this new restaurant called Koraku Ramen.  As I am not Japanese, not a subscriber to their phone tree or otherwise connected to the local Japanese social network scene.  So Hoodie, aka Godzilla X, thanks for bringing this new Japanese eatery to the attention of Yelp users.

Koraku Ramen, is a small chain restaurant from California (Little Tokyo and Sherman Oaks) that finally relocated their other Nevada location to Las Vegas.  So for those of you who have visited their other locations, you guys will probably be very familiar with their menu.  As for me, this is most likely the very first time I have ever been to one of their restaurants.  The LV branch is located in the same plaza as Krung Siam, Pho Little Saigon, Quiznos and Starbucks Coffee, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View.  Currently there is no signage indicating the name (or it was not put out on my first visit on Tuesday around 6pm) and unless you happened to read a little Japanese and can kinda sorta maybe translate the little "We're Open" sign near their front door, it will be hard to guess what kind of food they might serve.

The restaurant interior is pretty simply decorated, with a giant poster of an classic Japanese movie hanging above what looks like the exterior seating area of a ramen-ya in Japan.  There are additional smaller, classic Japanese movie posters on the wall, but you will have to tilt your head back to see them. Which is cool, because I enjoy watching old Japanese movies, and it kind of reminded me of the decor of the ramen museum (Yokohama, Japan) I visited with a a group of friends a few years back.  

Seats in the booth are surprisingly comfortable, thanks to the cushy cushions for our tushies.  It is the next best thing for our arse, than a pricier Derriere Facial.  Such thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.

The menu features entrees served with rice (such as various curries, katsu, sweet & sour pork meatballs), fried rice and noodles, and 1/3 of the menu dedicated to their diverse line up of ramen.  

Here are my impressions of the food I tried on my two visits (dinner and lunch):

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was mild but flavorful, not overly salty compared to most local ramen restaurants.  Chasu is nice, but could be even more tender and flavorful. Suggested add-ons:  Wakame, 3 slices of Chasu, and Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese flavored soft boiled egg).  (3.5/5)

Pork Fried Rice:  Simply prepared. Tasty.  (3.5/5)

Gyoza:  Nothing extraordinary, but prepared well.  Has nice crispy base, and is a good appetizer.  Server recommended that we eat it with the spicy oil (Ra-Yu). (3.5/5)

Beef Curry on Rice:  Decent.  (3/5)

Spicy House Special Ramen (mild):  Pretty good portion. A lot of ingredients, even without any add-ons.  Leosdianto L. commented that it kind of reminded him of ramen we make at home, and I agree.  (3.5/5)

Nikudango (Sweet & Sour Pork Meatballs):  The sauce seems to be on the salty side, but I didn't try this with rice.  Reminded me of meatballs on a skewer, without the pineapple and the stick.  (3/5)

Service (early dinner): We were the only there, so service was excellent.  The evening crew seems to be staff by mostly Japanese mothers.  They were very friendly, attentive, and food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. (4.5/5)

Service during the lunch rush (customers were overwhelmingly Japanese ex-pats, including local business owners and social gathering of house wives. When I closed my eyesand listen to their conversation, which I can't understand at all, it almost felt like I am in Japan without the cost of flight and hours on the plane) was friendly and attentive, but took the kitchen noticeably longer to serve up two bowls of ramen. (2.5/5)

Obviously the restaurant is very new, so it is super clean, and I expect that it will be maintained that way.

Parking. Not all that much (maybe 85) parking spaces in this tiny strip mall when it gets really busy. And there are no street parking in the immediate surrounding, being on the corner of two high traffic streets.  Big city dwellers will be used to that, for the rest be patient or walk a block or two.  (3/5)

Final thoughts. Koraku, once it has been opened for awhile and worked out most of the new restaurant kinks, it will be a respectable competition to other local Japanese restaurants that primarily serve ramen and curry.  Ramen combo deals (ramen + 1/2 order of fried rice or curry rice) is a good value for the Hungry-Man (R) and Hungry-Woman (patent registration pending).

P.S. It was great running into Mike C. and James I on my first visit.  Thanks for inviting me to join your party.  You guys are cool!

P.P.S.  Now accepting cash, credit and debit, gold and silver coins, and I.O.U.s from your pals.

3.5 stars.

After an eventful first day in Las Vegas; a day where everything that was planned seemed to fall by the wayside due to timing, Brand Steakhouse saved the day.

After our original dinner reservations at PRIME fell through due to timing, we decided to give the Brand Steakhouse downstairs a try.  Despite many reviews talking about the lack of quality restaurants within the Monte Carlo and they do not recommend this place, I decided to heed the advice of one my co-workers and give the place a try.  We originally made reservations for 6:45 but decided to pop down around 6 to see if anything was available beforehand.  I am glad we did because the place was relatively empty and we were seated immediately which saved us time and allowed us to not rush as much to ensure we made our show on time.  

Our server John was great, real down to earth, helpful in making suggestions and telling us of the specials for the evening and staying on top of everything.  We aren't drinkers so they quickly ushered away our unused wine glasses and our iced teas and water came out quickly.  Being as this was not the intended restaurant I went in with no knowledge of the menu but quickly settled on the 8oz. Filet Mignon (cooked well done) and a loaded baked potato on the side.  Yes; I know, well done and Filet do not go together but I don't like the pink and bloody steaks and am often told my steak more resembles a hockey puck or shoe leather as opposed to actual meat.  Well rest assured, Brand cooked the steak well done and it was still full of flavor and absolute perfect for my liking.  This to me is the surefire sign of a good restaurant, being able to adapt to a customers wishes and still deliver a great product.  I know a few other restaurants who could learn a thing or two from this place.  Both the steak and potato were delicious and quickly devoured.

My wife, who tends to eat much lighter and healthier than I, went with the crispy chicken.  This came sitting atop a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and she seemed to also really enjoy the dish.  We decided to go with the New York Cheesecake with berry compote for dessert.  This was quite a large slice for the price and being as we were sharing it, the size was quite adequate to close out the meal.  The food, service and ambiance were all amazing and for the price this place would be hard to beat on the strip.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert our bill was $113 bucks and after a generous tip we got out having spent significantly less than we would had if our original plans did not fall through.  I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back here again.

I was very VERY VERY underwhelmed by this place. Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. 

Yes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.

The Good: 
Bangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.

Stir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.

Watermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called it

Kalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.

Gelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.

Cheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portions

BACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.

The OK:
Prime Rib au jus
Blue cheese
Cream corn with red n green peppers
Most of the deserts

The unimpressive:
Angry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oily
Linked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interest
Fried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)
Gnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the past
The asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one out

The five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derrire!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.

The service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.

In summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...

One last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. Bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!

A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSg

Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a "waiting area".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA

After about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the "bier garten".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.

SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.

Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.

As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an "Oom-pah-pah band"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbA
They starting with "roll out the barrel" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!

FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a "lemon martini" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly "disappeared" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!

DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the "sauerkraut cake" (A chocoholics dream!).

If you come in not really hungry and you end up eating a lot more than you wanted to then the place has to be good, that's exactly what happened to me.  Let's just skip straight to the food. Going from what I took a picture first: 

Salmon Skin Handroll and Something Wrong #69 Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA 
Ever since Blue Fin Sushi turned me into a Salmon Skin Handrolls junkie I gotta have it every time I do AYCE sushi, if it's offered. It wasn't that bad; it was missing the crunchiness, but did the spot. The Something Wrong #69 was probably one of my favorite rolls. It's a shrimp tempura roll, which I usually a fan of, topped with spicy soft shell crab, tuna, salmon, white fish, and a spicy garlic ponzu. I devoured everything in that picture on my own. Sorry for not that great of a pic but the real stuff looked and tasted delicious.

Oysters - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#2sMNzctANegqVqvPkGG0lQ 
It was one of the items you could only order one of.  Honestly I love oysters but because I was only limited to 2 I don't think I had enough to like it too much. I inhaled them and don't remember the flavors.

Who's Your Ex-wife and Shrimp Tempura -  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#wyCtws-hZWHCkw_c3C1EUw 
Now the Who's Your Ex-wife is my kind of eats. I don't remember what exactly it was but I think it was a stuffed fried jalapeno with fish. I kind of wished I went back for seconds so I could've remember more but I liked it a lot cause it was spicy and delicious. The Shrimp Tempura was not bad just know that 1 order is just 2 pieces not your usual handful else where.

Spicy Garlic Edamame - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#cwzi6JqmNpr2L7IMg3KDlw
No one usually make um like this but I enjoyed them, though I didn't fill myself up on them because I was eating sushi. I'd order um.

Now for the other items:

Screaming O Sashimi - Why not!? I'm always a fan of the sauce as long as it's not too sweet. It was made right to my liking.

Nigiri - Not a great selection but I liked the garlic tuna, hamachi, cajun albacore, and sweet shrimp. Didn't care for the tamago or uni. A lot of the pieces were smaller than I'm use to but it's AYCE so ordering more is fine.

Apps - I liked the Golden Scallops and whatever I already mentioned. I ordered and really wanted the baked green mussels, agedashi tofu, and calamari rings but never got them.

Rolls - Well there's too many I liked so I'll say that there's an awesome selection of spicy, baked, deep fried, and shrimp tempura rolls. Should there ever be anything else!? Some honorable mentions Burning Your Ass roll, Fat Ass roll, Taste Like My X Girlfriend roll, Stacy Mom roll, Sexy Time roll, never mind I just started being immature.   For those try to cut back on rice there are a few no rice rolls.

The customer service was very friendly and brought food out in quickly but struggled keeping track of everyone's order. Jjanga is funny and loud great for kids. Anyways I'm still a fan for mostly everything so I'll be back.

Mr. K has covered most of the bases in his FTR, but there were a couple of things I thought I would add... 

The green chile beef is every bit as good as the red. We sampled both, as well as the beans (we choose Pima style which is the smashed version of beans rather than whole). All were very ample portions and exhibited crisp flavors. We all agreed that each could use a little salt, but after some discussion and a few sprinkles we came to the conclusion that actually it was preferable to season your own to your liking. Too often, we had all been served items which were over seasoned and quite frankly, there isn't much you can do once that has happened. This way, we each were able to make adjustments as desired. 

The bread itself seems a little more tender than TFBH. It also seemed a bit larger. That being said, we did each have the "full" version of the tacos, so the "half" may be more along the lines of what you might get elsewhere. Prices also seemed to be approximately $1.00 - 1.50 higher than TFBH, for the full portion. 

Some other items on the menu were both surprising and intriguing. I'm definitely going back for the Blue Corn Mush (I would have ordered it today, but I had already ordered my taco and was sure I couldn't handle both). I've never actually seen this on a menu off the reservation, so that in itself is enough to make me a repeat visitor. They have a few mutton and lamb selections that are obviously more on the authentic side. The mutton rib plate is served with sauteed squash and diced green chiles along with a navajo fry bread and drink ($11.99). The people at the next table had one of these and it was a large plate of food which they clearly enjoyed. There is a grilled lamb stir fry and also a lamb sandwich to round out the native selections. The sandwiches and burgers are a definite twist on the common offering. Sandwiches are served either a tortilla or fry bread and come with such toppings as eggs/bacon/onions/fire roasted green chiles, eggs/grilled spam, or two burger choices. Lastly there are the stews... yummo! They have the standard red and green, but also offer up a monthly special (this month was a very tasty vegetable style). Stews are served in two sizes, which is particularly nice if you are sharing items. 

The decor is certainly nothing that stands out; the chairs and tables are a mosh of options, but it is clean, and the staff is very friendly and patiently answered questions. They have one high chair for those of you with little ones. It is a small place, so if you go during peak hours expect to wait for a seat or take your food elsewhere to eat it, as it fills up quickly. 

The final distinction is that the SH is open on Sundays from 11:00 to 5:00. So if you are dying for some of that unbelievable fried dough on the morning after a long night out and had to previously wait until Monday, this could definitely be a saving grace. 

It's great to have another option and I truly hope that they will build a following in the Central Phoenix area.

Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.

They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.

For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.

Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck. 

Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike. 

The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats. 

The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup. 

For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.

Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed. 

However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.

Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

Once upon a time there were 3 bunnies... very hungry bunnies. Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat. It was seven hotels to be exact, actually, as they were on mission to complete...  *insert deep, booming voice* THE BUFFET OF BUFFETS!!!

And complete it they did! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ?select=cicuGUx9tyF5o88Ykc_0uA
I write today to tell the tale of the 3 bunnies' eating adventure on Easter weekend 2011.   

* SATURDAY *

Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo) - 12:50pm
- Officially got our wristband passes here + thus began the adventure. Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      

Lago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm
- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn't  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    

Le Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm
-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, crme brle, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  

The Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm
- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! 


* SUNDAY *

Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am
- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  

Flavors, The Buffet (Harrah's) - 11:30am
- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)

Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm
- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the "Asian noodles" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don't waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  

*****

Strategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). 

Priced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us 

   $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) 
+ $48 (1 extra BofB pass)
----------
   $261  

Split between 3 girls... that's DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn't a big deal.

And then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!

After how many failed attempts, I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my "to try" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. 

Time to get our glutton on, that's what!

I always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.

There's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. 

Offering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!

I finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.

Ending this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. 

If there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, "My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   

Bottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.

I had decided that I was not giving in to the "Pig-themed" restaurants.  I mean "Pig", "Pork" and "Swine" restaurants are popping up everywhere!  But I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore P&P, it would pop-up on all of the foodie sites that I check around Phoenix.  So, for several months, I scoped this place out... checked out this restaurant online and with daily drive-bys in my daily commute.  I finally decided 2 months ago that I needed to check out P&P.  I was sold, food-whipped on my first visit and I've been every week since.  They source all their veggies locally.  They make as much as they can in house from the meats on the chacuterie tray to the pickled veggie/items that appear on every dish.  They even bake their own bread!  I fell in love y'all, with a Pig & Pickle.

This restaurant is in a nondescript strip of shops.  I could not tell you what stores exist adjacent to P&P.  It is off the well "beaten Scottsdale Rd" path, and yet, the food is exciting, relevant and has a depth of flavors that is unbelievable.  I'm a fan of P&P and once you give it a try, I think you will be too.

I have tried a few things on the menu, let me start with the crafted cocktails - pricey, but still yummy and worth every penny.  They carry premium spirits and they make just about everything that goes in those crafted drinks from scratch.  If you don't want to spend $12 per cocktail, they have a wonderful HH menu with $5 cocktails from 4-6pm. Satly Dog: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aG_8tn9ZxqvTDDwRB-tfhA#wshXHwfqyLloLxHV7g86eQ 


The star of P&P is the food.  I have tried several things on the menu and I'm happy to say that not one thing was even remotely disappointing.  Everything that I've been served there was 4 Stars and above.  My favorite item thus far was on the new brunch menu.  P&P started serving brunch this past Sunday.  After church, I stopped in and ordered the Bloody Sconnie and the Bacon, Andouille Sausage and Aisago Cheese Fratta.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=f-ez6J4BhI4U2Gk_Brvr7Q&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA  An extremely delicious dish that is really more like a crustless quiche.  This dish has a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) kick to it.  It is not for the people who can't handle spicy food.  This dish was excitingly delicious.  

My 2nd favorite was the braised pork belly http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=od8GMSNVUu4fAT3H1IoqcA&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA   The braised pork belly sat atop a delicious mound of mashed turnip bottoms.  The pork belly provided the right amount of saltiness that was balanced just right by the sweetness of the apple butter.  The arugula top the creation was just the right amount of earthiness to pair with the turnip bottoms.  I love all the flavors.  But as I told my mom, it was almost like eating a southern meal that contained ALL these ingredients, but prepared somewhat differently!    

During Happy Hour, they offer a chacuterie plate http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n62C4gnnQkajkiORQ-tpaw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA that is HUGE for the $5 that they charge!  In this pic, the chacuterie included bacon butter to spread on my homemade pretezel bread.  YUMMY... YUM is all I can say!  

To top it off, they have the nicest guys working behind the bar.  I mean... honestly, part of what makes my day when I go into a place like this are cute guys who can mix a drink and order up some food for me to eat.  Clayton and Scott are awesomely attentive and I just love sitting at their bar!  

My to try list (because I trust everything on their menu):
Shrimp and Grits
Braised Duck Leg
Croque Madame
Salmon Tot - 6/30/2013 - 4star. 
Pork Shoulder Tostadas

Each 3rd Monday of the Month, join them for Beer Dinner 6:30pm.  I'm hopeful they will have other events in the future.  I think their crafted cocktails would be a great thing to center an event around.

Oh gosh, they have free wi-fi too!

This is a gem in Scottsdale/Old Town.  Eat, Pig out and Enjoy!

I have this horrible affliction where I have to go to new restaurants when they open, I'm  very impatient. And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. 

I'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. 

The Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. 

The Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. 

The Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. 

The Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). 

All in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.

***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***

In terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).

There were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.

In terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.

There was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.

The breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).

The chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.

The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.

The eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.

In addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.

Service was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.

The price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.

The dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.

The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.

I know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.

I picked a good night to try Sabatino's. I called in to see if they had any specials going on and since it was Monday, The girl on the phone suggested the "Monday Special" to me. Mondays you can get a large cheese pizza (dine-in or carryout only) for $8.99 (regularly $12.99) plus tax and $1.50 for each additional topping. I thought that was a great price to see if I would even like it or not so I ordered a "Pepperoni Pizza" for pick up. The ordering process was easy and I appreciated the great customer service the girl taking the order gave and going over the specials with me.

When I arrived the place was full of people so I took this as a good sign. The inside isn't very big, but clean and cozy. I walked over to the cash register and was greeted by a nice young girl who rang me up and went over the weekly specials with me while my pizza was being boxed up. She also gave me a menu to take home and look over. It wasn't too cold of a night so I asked for some paper plates so hubby and I could eat our pizza at one of the many tables I noticed outside on the way in. Plates, pizza and now drinks in hand we headed outside.

When I first opened the pizza box it didn't look that appetizing, but we all know looks can be deceiving and that was the case this time. The sauce on the pizza is really what stood out to me. The sauce was just tasty! The cheese, crust and pepperoni were good. I had some that was left over for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good, even cold! I will be back to try other menu items!

Pizza sizes are medium (14"), large (16"), extra large (21") and Sicilian. 

They have over a dozen lunch specials, but here are a few:
-slice of cheese pizza and a side salad for $4.99
-slice of cheese pizza and 1 garlic knot slider for $5.99
-2 slices of cheese pizza for $5.99
-any regular sized hot or cold sandwich and fries for $8.99
-spaghetti with marinara and garlic bread for $4.99

All lunch specials include a drink! Lunch specials are currently from 11 am - 3 pm.

They offer delivery with a minimum $12 purchase and deliver pretty far out so call and check to see if they deliver to you.

If you are looking for an affordable family meal you might want to check out their "all you can eat anytime" deal. It costs $7.99 and includes cheese pizza, any pasta with marinara, and a side salad. I am assuming when I walked in and saw so many people, that they were taking advantage of this deal, but who knows. 

Tuesday and Wednesday if you buy any entree, large or extra large pizza at regular price, you get a 2nd of equal or lesser value for half off. Dine-in or carryout only.

After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.

The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. 

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.

Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. 

Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. 

Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. 

They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar.

After reading so many reviews on the positive and negative about the place I just didn't know what to expect.  My opinion after chowing down there is that there's a lot to love about the place and a lot to be... What's the right word?  Annoyed at...

Maybe we'll discuss the positive first, the food!  Let me first explain that I hardly EVER order chicken at a restaurant.  Usually it's never cooked right.  Sure I order wings here and there, but never as a main dish.  It's usually too dry.  I hardly even eat chicken at home, I can't cook it right either!  So going to a BBQ place while dieting creates a lot of challenges.  One is that the BBQ chicken (non-fried) was the best option.  So I was nervous, real nervous.  But let me tell you... It. Was. Awesome!  So tender and juicy and flavorful.  Best chicken I've ordered in a restaurant EVER!  I was in cluck cluck heaven!  

We went hog wild (funny, right?) and ordered every single one.  When in Rome, right?  So let's go down the list.  

Cornbread: Okay, but a little too grainy for my taste (and $3 for one slice!!)
Potato Salad: Okay.  I like Potato Salad with crisp not mushy potatoes, and they were but the taste just wasn't there for me.
Mac n' cheese: Good.  It was incredibly creamy and tasty, but not the best I've ever had (Kelly's, Six Penn Kitchen, etc.).
Coleslaw: Okay. Vinegar based, which I usually dig, but again, just wasn't the best I've ever had
Baked Beans: Delicious!  I loved the taste!  Bacon, perhaps a little sweet Maple Syrup or Cinnamon?  Whatever, it tasted awesome!
Greens: The winner!  It was vinegar based as well and bursting with flavor.  Toss in some more bacon and bam, best of the night!

The food presentation is pretty cool too.  They just bring out everything on a big metal try and every side comes in a different looking pan it's probably cooked in.  I loved the BBQ too because again, the magic ingrediant, it had a ton of vinegar flavor!  Good thing they had extra sauce on the table because I doused my chicken in it.  

The bad.  It's WAY overpriced.  The food is simple but good.  The meats are $12-$22 for half and full racks and the sides are $1-5 on their own.  Why the high price?  Do you want to be upscale BBQ?  Does that even make sense?  Upscale I imagine has a totally different environment to go with it.  The sad thing is, it's pretty good so I bet they won't lower prices.  

The decor is minimal and simplistic.  Red gingham walls and long picnic table seating.  I wouldn't mind the picnic tables if they were a little skinnier.  It's true what everyone's saying, it's hard to hear the person across from you.  Also, if it's busy and there's a wait, people at the front are standing there with no tables to put drinks on while they wait and pretty much starring down the people sitting at the tables right in front of them.  It's just awkward and I feel like they need some high tops up front or some bench seating.    

If they lowered prices, I'd probably throw on another star and be back more often.  Because of that very reason, I probably won't visit often, even though I did enjoy it.  Time will tell....

I don't go out much or get to.. to say the least, but Sage.. saved me from every aspect of isolation of a homebody. Nestled in Aria Hotel, on the casino level by the front desk, adjacent from Julian Serrano. The array of deep, neon hues of purple awaits as you walk by the bar and into the main dining room. Three words to describe the ambiance: Sultry, sexy, and sooooothing. The bar and lounge area is quite inviting. I wouldn't mind at all having my meal there. 

My classy date and I were greeted by a kind, smiling lovely hostess named Alexis. I appreciate that so much, since the warm welcoming gives a great start to a wonderful dining experience.  We were then escorted in by the assistant manager and even pulled out the table and chair for us. My Oh my it just gets better and better!!! 

This was my first time trying a Signature Tasting Menu and honestly, I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be able to share this experience with someone that loves great creations of food as much as I do. *Sigh I'm so happy... We tasted everything, shared everything, and that in itself meant Everything to me. 

The 1st Course: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE 
w/ Pickled Mustard Seeds. Crushed Caper Aioli , Slow Poached Egg, & Crispy Chocolate  -Extraordinary. By far the best beef tartare I ever had. The presentation itself was breathtaking and simply a work of art. Once you mix the egg with beef, the texture is ever so creamy. After my first bite, combining everything even the piece of thin, airy chocolate on top of a tasty olive oil infused, crispy brioche toast. I was singing.. Isn't she lovely... yeeeeees. All the ingredients, solid flavors were bursting with surprise in my mouth. It's nothing like I ever tasted before. If this is how it feels when you fall in love... I'm deeply in love.

We also went all out and substituted for yes..... the FOIE GRAS BRULEE!!! The soft, slightly salty brioche muffin contrast with the richness of the foie gras.. make whoopie by eating this. A very sensual dish. This hypnotizing flavor is all new to me..  dizzy in love again.. perhaps that was the champagne?! Reggie, our sommelier was informative and great. 

The 2nd Course: BACON- WRAPPED RABBIT      
English Pea Ravioli/Nueske Bacon, & Sweet Onion Sauce - Vibrant green colors.. gave away this freshness to the eyes. Beautiful dish. Every single element in this entree were magically paired to one another. It was as if you were eating your favorite song. Rabbit.. oh Rabbit.. I love you... Damn it.. I do. *hitting the dining table with my fists... gawd I want more and more of you. Addicted..

MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS 
Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms, & Salted Caramel Reduction -My favorite seafood.. Scallops! Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and oh so damn succulent. Forget day dreaming.. I fantasize about this dish. Can't get enough of it. I want this dish and I want it Bad. Delicious!

The 3rd Course:  We both ordered... 48 HOUR BEEF BELLY  
Shaved Purple Asparagus/Ramp-Sorrel Puree, & Pickled Ramps/Toasted Almond - Very rich and the depth of flavor is endless. Extremely tender and effortlessly melts in your mouth. This isn't for the faint of heart, but for a heart of gold due to the luxuriance of the meat. Happily satisfied :)

The 4th course: GIANDUJA PAVE 
Olive Oil Ice Cream, Hazelnut Crunch, & Basil Jam -Odd combination, but it was the best ending to such an amazing, memorable dinner. Again, everything I tasted was like a stimulating, new fairy tale story. It made such a profound impact of how I felt at that present moment and I could say... I could have fallin' in love. I never knew food could alter the way I feel and gosh darn it... I felt So beyond special. I never smiled so bright. My tummy was beaming! 

We were also offered complimentary breads in the beginning of sourdough or bacon bread. Bacon, by far was it for me and the whipped, creamy butter with sea salt .. yes another smile on this face. *sigh We also did the wine pairing with our Tasting :) I could cry out of joy from this experience. Pure bliss... Maybe since the flavors and simple ingredients were like traveling and exploring a new country.. a first for me. I was just stunned and even turned on by how delicious this restaurant was. The dim, cozy decor, and colors makes this ideal for a perfect Romantic date. I seriously couldn't be more pleased and happy. I love the fact my date has great taste in food and loves exploring as much as eating. Great company and great food can definitely lead to great things ;) The service was exceptional, top notch, 5 solid stars... The GM, Robert was ever so personable, funny, and kind by checking up on us throughout our evening. Our servers, runners, bussers, all worked smoothly together and made this one of the best dining experience I ever had in my entire life. Thank you. That being said.. This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I can't wait to go back.

There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.

I was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.

The heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the dcor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.

Three menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.

My bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.

The roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  

It took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.

Fine Dining while watching the open kitchen here was one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. We had made reservations for the L'Unique menu which was designed for people who wanted a complete meal but had limited dining time (such as before a show). For $59.00, we got to enjoy a fantastic meal of an app, entree and dessert- all served within about 15 minutes. 
Started with a bread basket that i'm sure would make Anthony N's bread basket notes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=wcB4tCCHDP-MVZgumBWRIw It was served with 3 kinds: baguettes, country rolls and croissant rolls. The croissant was my favorite. They give u generous pads of butter and will give u extra bread- so eat up! You will be hard pressed to find better bread baskets. 
For the L'unique menu, we got to choose from two different items for each part of the meal. Between the bf and i, we got to try all of them. 
My dish: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=WtpRh5soYH-ievHYOznn7g
Everything was beautiful and tasted amazing. They gave a pretty good amount of lobster with the sole and the sauces and vegetables were perfect. The salmon and tuna tartare was yum and tasted very fresh. The dessert was light and delicious and so very pretty :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=_t-FoXFZtmghxSyON9UZzg
Dude had the flank steak (cooked perfectly) with buttery mash potatoes, asparagus and the lemony berry dessert. Dude dislikes veggies, but he loved every bite of his meal.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=IDFSuLaOxP67CEmLH10DuA
The best part of this experience is watching the chefs making these beautiful dishes. Every chef had their special tasks in making each dish complete to perfection. We even saw a chef using tweezers to carefully place pieces together of a salad. Although the chefs and servers move swiftly to try to complete your meal in the promised 15 minutes, you never feel rushed or see anything done hastily. Our waiter checked on us just enough times to make sure everything was great and took the time to make conversation as well and answer any questions we had. 

Dude is a notoriously slow eater, and i had surprise tickets for him to see the Jabbawockeez after dinner. While he was busy taking photos of the decor and watching the chefs- i was afraid we were never gonna get to the show in time at the rate he was going, not even having touched his bread yet. But as dinner was served- to see his reaction to finally finding a vegas hotel restaurant that he truly enjoyed (he always complains they r never great)- from him watching the chefs, to enjoying every morsel on his plate, was well worth the price and nervousness!!!

*if you want the Ultimate Robuchon experience, go to his restaurant next door.  (inside the MGM)

I had eaten at the Earl of Sandwich on the strip a few times and liked it, but never new we had another location at the Palms. That was until I got a coupon booklet in the mail for a variety of places at the Palms, Earl of Sandwich being one of them. I signed up for the Earl of Sandwich e-club after the first time I ate at the strip location and for my birthday this year they sent a coupon good for 1 free sandwich and 1 free drink, no purchase required. Score! Since I had the coupon from the booklet at the palms with a BOGO and the birthday coupon this seemed like the perfect time to try the location at the Palms and eat for almost free. :)

This Earl of Sandwich is located in the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino, between Chronic Tacos and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It is open 24/7. The one thing I noticed different about this location from the other one on the strip is they have no inside seating. You have to find a table (not many) in the middle of the food court. Also, the "order here" and "pick up here" lines are very close together. While placing my order I had to move out of the way and stop placing my order twice so that other customers could get their food. They need to really make some adjustments as far as where people should place an order and pick one up. 

The girl at the register who took my order was very friendly and polite. She had trouble getting one of the coupon codes to scan and after she asked the manager for help several times,  was finally able to get it on her own. I felt bad that the manager was ignoring her and talking on her cel phone instead. They had a promotion going on called "Dine with the Royal Couple" that offered 2 sandwiches not regularly on the menu. The 2 sandwiches were the "Avocado BLT" and "Pastrami Reuben" both priced at $6.99, but I used the BOGO and ordered 1 of each. I left off the kraut and thousand island dressing and just requested mustard be put on it. I usually would love having the sandwich the way it came, but hubby doesn't like the other stuff so we just customized it a bit since we were sharing each sandwich. The Pastrami Reuben was very good, but skimpy on the meat. Hubby would have to eat 2 of these to get full. The Avocado BLT was also very good except some bacon pieces were too fatty while the other pieces has great meaty flavor. The bacon was cooked fresh so kudos for that. All the sandwiches are made fresh to order here. They were generous with the fresh avocado too. So for the free sandwich from the birthday coupon I ordered a "Full Montagu" priced at $6.49, but of course the awesome coupon took care of that! The Full Montagu has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato and mustard sauce. I had them leave off the lettuce. So with everything I said was in the Full Montagu you would expect something pretty big right? Nope! This sandwich was very good, but again just too skimpy on what they put between the bread. With the coupons we did get full though! I do like that the sandwiches are generally under $6.49 so even if hubby needs to order 2 to get full, it really isn't any more in price then ordering a burger and fries at a average restaurant. 

Earl of Sandwich also offers a variety of salads, wraps and artisan soups (soup selection changes daily). They also have sides like coleslaw, potato salad, pasta salad and chips. Breakfast is served daily until 11 am and they use fresh cracked eggs! There is a kids menu and when it comes to dessert Earl of Sandwich has a lot of tasty looking sweets, including brownies made with Ghirardelli chocolate.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100

Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!

GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.

We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.

While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.

I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.

Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.

They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.

What we ordered:

--BREAD--
Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!

--DRINKS--
PIMMS CUP: 
Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.

WYDERS PEAR CIDER:
The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!

--STEAKS--
BEEF WELLINGTON:
So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.

KOBE FILET MIGNON:
My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!

--SIDE DISH--
TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:
I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!

--DESSERT--
STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!

Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!

First off, I should mention that I'm not the biggest fan of savory items baked in a crust, ie empanadas, pot pies, etc.  But I couldn't ignore my fellow Yelpers checking into this less than a month old establishment over on the Eastside and the raving reviews.

Thanks to all the Yelpers who reviewed this before me, it definitely helped knowing exactly where they are located.  And where's that?  Commercial Center - Lotus of Siam and Green Door fame.  They are located next door to Komol, so keep driving and you'll find it there.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  But we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar/counter seating with large and small tables around.  Because it was Superbowl Sunday, the place was empty so we had our pick of where to sit.  The waitress was so happy to see us come in since previous Sundays bring in a good lunch crowd.

We started off with the Oven Chips with added Garlic "Hand cut British style chips, cooked in the oven, with cracked pepper and sea salt." ($3.75)  It came out piping hot with ketchup on the side.  

The Husband was immediately intrigued by the soups and went for the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton (Cup $3.50). It came with homemade bread and butter.  We liked the blue cheese flavoring in the soup and the dense bread that accompanied it.

The Husband chose a Signature and Traditional Pasty - The Oggie "Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup." ($8.50)  He asked for a side of HP sauce too.  I got a little taste, but ultimately the Husband devoured all of it.  It's a pretty good size and for someone who drank most of the soup and finished the whole pasty, he was full!

I chose a Premium Pasty - the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) "Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes.  With a side of mint-yogurt dressing or tahini." ($9.00)  I'm always skeptical about getting chicken breast because of how dry it can be.  This was not the case at all!  It was super moist, tons of flavor, and just really good.  I ate half knowing that I would be hurting if I even tried to finish the other half.  (I did eat the other half the next day and it was just as good! The toaster oven couldn't heat it fast enough for me!)  What I really liked about their pasty is the ratio of filling to crust.  There's a lot of delicious filling and the crust isn't excessive or dried out.  Ultimately, just really good.

I took a quick peek at their dessert menu and was bummed out that I was too full to order anything.  In retrospect, perhaps I would have split one pasty so I could order a dessert pasty too.  Nonetheless, we came back about four hours later and picked up a Strawberry Pavlova "Homemade crisp meringue shells, filled with freshly whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi fruit and grapes.  Finished with raspberry coule." ($6.00) to go.  It wasn't the most exciting to look at when you take it to go, but it was nice.  Next time I'm going for the Apple Caramel Pasty, Shirley Temple's Pudding, or Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding since those seem a bit more unique.

They offer a pretty extensive beer menu that had the Husband wishing he could sit awhile and have a drink.  Happy Hour is all day on Sundays from 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 12 am on the other days, which means $1 off beer and wine.  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays also offer a special on the the certain alcoholic beverages.

Overall, we are liking the pasties that the Cornish Pasty Company are offering and are happy to see them in Vegas.  We only wish they weren't so far away on the other side of town from us!

Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large "Onion Loaf" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the "Chopped Salad" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes" and "Lyonnaise Potatoes" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the "Key Lime Pie" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing "lime" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)

4.5 stars!

Today was my second visit, and I like this eatery!   The ambience is laid-back, despite the gorgeous marble bar counter, distinctive winery flourishes (I looked for beer taps,  but didn't see any), including cut-out kegs doubling as decorative shelves, and one flat-panel TV (this isn't a sports bar). Matt and Shawn (the latter had been the former manager of neighbor Four Peaks) are gracious as  always.  Chef Indy remembered me from my first visit, as the guest who ordered the spare ribs without the BBQ sauce and the chocolate bread pudding, which he made a chocolate ganache especially for me, because I couldn't have the regular chocolate sauce laced with corn syrup.

This afternoon's dishes all tasted terrific, and I enjoyed the textures:

Calamari app- Menu says $10, and 3.5 weeks ago was half-off during happy hour.  Menu still lists the price at $10, but my receipt said $9, with $2 off during HH.  Loved the crunch!  The calamari was prepared just the way I like calamari to be, and I know Mom would love it, as well.  The accompanying garlic aioli and marinara were great, as well, with the aioli being a little saltier than I'd prefer.  My only gripe is that for $9 original price, I didn't get a lot of calamari, so I'd only order it during HH...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w#Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w

Twisted Burger- $14, and comes with house fries.  Matt had told me about TR's mac 'n cheese more than three weeks ago and said that he could sub it for the fries, if I wanted.  The burger came with brie, perfectly-crisped thick bacon (!), arugula, and tomato jam, which I'd asked for on the side.  It's made with sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine and sugar reduction.  It added a definite sweetness to the burger and complemented it well, but for someone with inflammation issues, I'd skip it next time.  (Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, is one of many inflammatory foods.)  The mac 'n cheese was DELICIOUS!  Today's preparation consisted of cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and a little bacon.  I had to stop myself from eating too much!  Again, this dish is a little pricey for me, especially since I can't have the tomato jam...  The great quality of the mac 'n cheese kind of makes up for the price, just a little.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ#SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg#AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg

Double Chocolate Lava Cake- $8, and usually comes with vanilla ice cream, which contained corn syrup that I can't have, so  Chef Indy (sp?) offered to whip up some fresh heavy cream and granulated sugar.  He also offered to make a caramel sauce when I asked if instead of whipped cream, I could have some creme anglaise.  He wasn't sure which of the two I wanted, so he decided to give me both!  After the first bite of one lava cake, though, I knew the whipped cream and the caramel sauce were not needed.  This dessert should be called Better Than Sex, and really, what better metaphors for sex are there but volcanoes and lava, eh?  And boy, was this dark chocolate lava hot, thick, and decadent!  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  ;)  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the lava oozing out... I couldn't stop eating to take other photos...  If only there weren't other people present, I'd have licked that plate clean!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw#fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw

Btw, Thursday night is Ladies' Night, which means happy hour* deals ALL DAY for women.  Also, live music entertainment is held from 6p to 9p.  I enjoyed it, and so did the other women who filled up the main dining room.

*Happy hour deals changed since my last visit three and a half weeks ago.  It used to feature half-off appetizers, but now it's just $2 off the apps.  There are wine specials, too, both by the glass and bottles.  If you feel like splurging, try the Sexual Chocolate by Slo Down Vines, $45.  Very good!

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

LOSING!!!

This is not my favorite hotel on the strip. Is it full of history with old rooms that smell? Yes that is the smell of History. Come on Sinatra has a suite here. I am sure there are things in this hotel we do not want to know anything about, so sometimes it is better to just hold your nose & deal with it.

I have only stayed at this hotel because of work. I would never personally pick this place ever.

When I check-in, I asked for a Humidifier and I was promptly told, "the Riv does not have any". I informed the check-in agent that I stay in Vegas 3 times a year & every hotel has humidifiers. She promptly told me I was wrong & she questioned what hotels I stayed at last. I informed her and she said, "That is hard to believe because one of the hotels I mentioned was a sister property and they do not have humidifiers!" I looked at her and said, "I am sorry because they gave me one for a week!"  So frustrating! Why are you arguing with me?

Two days went by and I was about to go to Walgreens to purchase a Humidifier. I decided to call Housekeeping and just ask. The Manager in Housekeeping said, "I wish you would have called two days ago because I think I am out of them!" I was so mad that I actually listened to the front desk. I should have just called two days ago. The Manager was so sweet because I asked her to call me back within the hour because if I did not hear from her I would go and buy one. Five minutes later there was a knock at my door and I was handed a humidifier.  That was 5 star service but the front desk not knowing or even making an attempt to get me a humidifier was 0 stars.

My dry cleaning was suppose to be in my room by 7pm the night before. As I was getting ready in the morning I noticed my dry cleaning was not there. I tried several times to call the Bell Hop, to inquiry about my dress shirt but no one ever picked up the phone. So I decided to pick up my shirt myself & went down on my way to work. I informed the Bell Hop my shirt was never delivered. He then looked at me and said, "Did you look in the closet?" I honestly wanted to biff myself in the head and say, "I wish I had a V8!" I looked at him and said, "Really?" He then went to look for my shirt but made sure to tell me that he probably did not have it. Guess what? He had my shirt. Then he had the rudeness to say, "I am going to need to see your ID!" I looked at him and said, "What are the chances that I gave you my last name, my room number, color of shirt and that it wasn't delivered to my room and it isn't my dress shirt???" He said, "Well I have to be sure!" I said, "Just be sure you are making me late for work and I now have to get dressed in the Lobby bathroom now!" Honestly what is the deal with these guys! Are people stealing dry cleaning in hotels?

I also had to leave notes around my room to inform the maid not to touch my stuff. Please do not move my toothbrush and various bathroom stuff. Is it really necessary?  The kicker was the day I walked in and my room was not made and it was 7pm at night. I called the manager and he said, "I see your room has been marked off as cleaned!" I told him to come on up or I could email him photos. He asked if he could send up the maid now and I said, "No! I am in my room & I am good!" Five minutes later there was a knock on my door from the maid who insisted to come in and clean my room. I had to tell her that I was good & did not want my room cleaned. It was more principal. Don't check my room off as clean and then not clean it.

The kicker is this. I decided to go green & check-out from my television. It then asked me to find the keyboard in the room to type in my email to send me out a final bill. I then opened every drawer in my room to find the keyboard. I then called down to the front desk and was informed that none of the rooms have keyboards. Really? Why tell me to check out from the room & I can not get a bill emailed to me. The front desk manger promised me to email me my final bill. It has been 7 days since I have checked out I have not gotten my final bill. I called after 24 hours and had them email me again. No email. I have in fact called 5 times & I have them send out emails to two different email addresses. Guess what? No email. 

I also had food here once too. I had one of the pre-packed salads from the coffee shop. I opened my salad only to find wilting lettuce in the container. So gross! That was the first & last time that I ate at the hotel. If you stay here you are going to be taking cabs down the street or walking to get to any decent restaurants. There is nothing to do at this end of the strip!

I am hating this review right now because I am taking a big deep breath & reliving this lack of customer service at the Riv! This hotel is not a Five Star Hotel. My room was suppose to be non-smoking but it still smelled like smoke. I guess after 58 years you will never be able to get the smoke of the walls!

I saw a lot of mixed reviews on Burger Bar (both for this location and the one in San Francisco), but I was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on Top Chef Masters.

It actually took some time to find it.  Burger Bar is not located in Mandalay Bay but Mandalay Place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  It was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  When Burger Bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.

The atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  The atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  The dining area was not that big.  Seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.

The focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  While it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for Las Vegas.  Many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in L.A.  At Burger Bar, there are a few pricier burgers and burgers can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.

I went with the American Kobe Beef burger.  The burger was about small-to-medium sized.  A lot of burger places like The Counter and Father's Office definitely have bigger burgers.  The bun (which can be customized) was nice.  The tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  I got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade Dijon mustard.  The meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  It was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.

I ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  Skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  I liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  Since they just opened the restaurant, I was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  I've definitely had my share of food in Vegas that was served cold, but I would think this place would have a higher standard.

The milkshake was expensive but good.  It was a chocolate and Nutella milkshake.  It had a good flavor and consistency.  It could have been a little colder.  It was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  It was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  While I liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.

The waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.

There is a lot of bad and overpriced food in Vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  Burger Bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the Vegas restaurants I've tried.  It also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  Still, if you go to one of those cafes in Vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.

I probably would not make a special trip to Burger Bar, but if we were around Mandalay Bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, Burger Bar would definitely be a place I would give another try.

Final Note: For me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  Chef Hubert Keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  He was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).

Alright, now were getting to the good stuff. 

And by "good" I mean un-fucking-believable. Yea, I said it. Unreal. Never have I wanted to pick up and move to Vegas so much in all of my life, but I'm thinking about it after the dinner I had at Sushisamba's new ultra lounge, Sugarcane. This is an incredible statement for me because for one, I can only take Vegas in small doses, and two, I despise the heat. So having said that you can believe me when I say that I love absolutely everything about Sushisamba, the Brazilian/Peruvian/Japanese fusion restaurant at the Palazzo. 

Where do I begin?

Oh yes, Holy Mary Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven...

A friend of mine is the Publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, Sugarcane. She hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. Upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. As we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the DJ booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of Sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. I"m gonna do my best to do it justice but I would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...

The walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of Samurais and Japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. The DJ that night was Claudio who I wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. There are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. 

The food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. Our waiter Anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. Of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so I guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. Our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (I forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. We ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. 

Our table decided to order the signature Sushisamba 7-course Omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. Anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. Our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the Kobe beef carpaccio with wild mushrooms, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was AMAZING! Next up was the best snow crab I have ever tasted, filet mignon, duck, Chilan Sea Bass (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (I forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate I've ever seen/tasted. Just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. A stand out roll was the Kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what I can remember) a spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado center. As we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, Anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with Japanese-style sesame rice krispies, Japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. There were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caramel topping. 

Do you see what I'm talking about?????

Here's the rundown....

Party of four:
First round of cocktails (on the house)
Several cocktails to follow
Bottle of premium sake
7- course Omakase dinner for four ($70 each)
After dinner cocktails
Divine dessert platter

Total bill: Approx $600

Not bad I'd say. Not bad at all. 

All in all, I plan to go back to visit several times over. Anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. This dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. 

Sushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the DJ. You rock my rock-n-roll world.

The only thing that could've possibly made my meal at The Estate House any worse, is if we had to pay for it...

My bf and I stopped by for a drink on the night of their grand opening about 2 weeks ago... it was beautiful and the staff was pleasant; many of them my bf knew from previous workplaces.  So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!

The meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  

Although Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...

The menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.

One thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with "Warm Camembert," toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  

So, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...

So, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the "Estate House Fruit De Mer" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  

We basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!

Fortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.

The Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.

* Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. * 

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef "devil dawgs" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.

Let me apologize for not writing during these past few days...  sori!
Here is the reason...  I knew I was going to Vegas, I understand that my next one is my 100th review, therefore, I had to review one of the much better places to make my 100th review shine!  There's no other place better than City of Sin to scout out all the awesome eateries so that is why I've delayed my review for the entire weekend.. again, sori!  I do hope you all understand...

So... 100th one... what should I have...  Buffet of course!  Didn't get the chance to check out Wynn again (it's been a long time), but at least I end up at Rio's famous Carnival World Buffet...  So here it goes...

First of all, the name of the buffet has the word "World" in it... I bet you wouldn't expect it but literally, the selection is as big as this world!  Last time I've been there I remember the food lineup were as long as Walmart on Black Friday!!!  But now... it seems like the line is actually as long as Best Buy on Black Friday!!! (For those who has done the BF thing will understand my reference, good luck by the way if you are going this year!)

Focus Henry Focus!!!  Ok... so... damn!!!  The selection seem to be longer than before... so let me tell you how this great wall of buffet is set up!  

Starting from the left, you got like 8 different styles of pizzas, some condiments for burgers, bunch of seafood delicacies, crab legs & crab claws, deep fried seafood, mash potatoes along with the carving station, roast chicken, Mexican food sections such as taquitos, flautas, quesadilla, mole, carne asada, more mexican condiments, etc., The Bar (for some real fun drinks not ice tea or coke), Fresh Noodle station with pho, egg noodles, soups ranging from egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, etc. fish balls, pork balls, beef balls, more chinese condiments, chinese food such as chow mein, stir fried veggies, some meat dishes, dim sum, sweet bbq pork, roast duck, Italian/seafood, lasagna, meat balls, blackened catfish, broiled salmon, salisbury steak, country fried steak, , corn, pork chops,4 types of hot soups, salad station, fruits, cold salad related sides, wall........  Whew.... I'm terribly sorry for the EXTREMELY LONG RUN ON SENTENCE, but that is the best way to describe this unworldly buffet line!!! It is literally that long!!!  And let me tell you, despite all the descriptions, I probably missed like 30% of the food on that great wall of buffet!!!  It's absolutely ridiculous that they expect anyone to try all of their food here!!!

Ah ha!  That's when I come in!  Agent H on the job!

So I had to get very small portions and was actually able to get one of each samples from the plates on display... OMG was I full!!!  I swear I will never do that again!!!  Rio I hate you for doing this to me!!!  You leave all this deliciousness out there just so you can see me suffer!!! WHY???  (But I thank you for the yummy food!)

So enough with the descriptions.. I know if I continue on this post 5001 character is not enough!  So here's my assessment and evaluation of this monstrosity that they called a buffet line.  

Everything was actually decently made!!!  I pretty much enjoyed every single thing there with the exception to the following...  (you definitely should read this and skip them because I suffered to get you this piece of important info!)

Things to skip:
**Sushi -- hard cold rice, not fresh at all
**Veggies -- waste of stomach space
**Noodle soup -- This is an iffy... I loved the soup but was way too salty, maybe Mr. chef there can add some hot water or something? It's quite salty
**Salmon -- Not sure how but they overcooked it... pretty dry and hard
**Corn Chowder -- nothing special, again takes up space in tummy
**Dim sum -- maybe it wasn't fresh when we got there but looked stale and old... very uninteresting.......
**Fried fish filet -- Dude, these patties are from the supermarket!  (Van De Kamps)  Not tasty at all

Do try everything else!

Now... they still have dessert!!!  AHHHHH!! I can't take this anymore!  All this food and now a dessert island station right by the exit!!! 

Sure I'll take some yummy treats please!

Gelatos! Gelatos! Gelatos!  Tried all of them and here are my favorite and least liked choices...

Dislike:  Coconut---way too sweet
Right in the middle:  Vanilla Yogurt---pretty tasty without that much sugar
Favorite:  Sugarless Chocolate---WOWzers!  Taste like chocolate without the sugar!  Rich, Creamy, and absolutely amazing for being sugarless!  Where you've been all this time???

Other desserts were on my notable list too such as bread pudding (I heart bread puddings with Whiskey sauce), cheesecake cup, and the best dessert would have to be the super eggy flan!  Extremely enjoyable!

So now... can someone wheel me out of this place?  Get me out of here before I say... Yes... I would like to see what else they got... maybe another ice cream?  maybe another cake?  Maybe this is one of Sin City's absolute best?  Just maybe...

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.

So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!

COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)

So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!

So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...

Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)

The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!

Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)

The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...

Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)

Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!

Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!

One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...

So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!

Wickedly Awesome!

Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?

I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other. 

I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.

I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 / 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad. 

Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?! 

On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.

A few notes to St. Francis operations.
Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.

Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?

Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.

I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.


Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.

We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.

Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our "Roasted Jalapeno Poppers" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. 

"Just Fries" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. 

"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it. 

"American Burger" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. 

"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.

I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with "Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom" to which I replied "did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food" and he just said "I'll take the fries off" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.

I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes" were just average. The "Cheese Bread" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The "Carmalized Bananas" were actually very good, but the "Crispy Polenta" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the "Papaya Cream" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.

I saved my 700th review for something righteously outstanding. We decided to square in on something difficult for us to get to normally for our staycation time and this was the one place I was I really wanted.

The space is modern and vibrant and it was a lovely day so we sat outside. They had a white peach pomegranate ice tea that is a must order. It's fruity and refreshing. 

After much back and forth on several attractive sounding dishes and suggestions from our waiter we decide on our lunch. While we waited, he came back with a little amuse bouche of sorts. He wanted us to try some of their very popular curry soup and it was quite nicely spiced and complex. Promising for our food to come.

He brought a few bottles of hot sauces to the table that were favorites and explained each one. A place of my heart - I love things to be more spicy as of late! 

Short rib sandwich was a beef dream. The braise on them was done right and it was tender and juicy and the jalapeno bacon was smoky and really nicely crispy contrast and their ciabatta bread was good and held up to the meats. I threw on some Scotch Bonnet hot sauce on this was it elevated it perfectly. Sweet potato fries were really light and crispy, more like chips in that addictive keep dipping in the chipotle mayo on the side and popping it in your mouth sort of way.

The "bowl of the day" was spiced chicken and chorizo bowl with roasted corn and chilies. This was such a hearty portion we could not finish. Lovely spice and I like that the chorizo was crisped up on the edges. This went well with the mango hot sauce on our table and was such a addictive combo. Being Asian I've cooked up just about everything and ordered everything with rice that it's hard to make me think it's the best thing on rice since white on rice. I loved this dish and reminded me of what my carribean creole neighbors mango gumbo fed me as a kid. Gah, nostalgia gets you every time. 

Since it was our first time there,  our server got us a small slice of their carrot ginger cake to taste. We were full and didn't think we can take more than a bite, but we had to eat it. It was moist, had a very nice balance of spice and the frosting was not too sweet. The raspberry and mango sauces and fresh berries on the plate were perfect accompaniments. I love carrot cake and haven't had one make me smile in a long time. My little heart is pining for some right now. I want a whole cake - none for anyone else. 

Service here was amazing. Our server Lorenzo was so upbeat and friendly and uber attentive to little details. That's what puts this place over the edge for me was all the small things which is such a rarity. Since it was our first time he told us the story of the place and food, took his time running through the menu populars and his personal favorites when we couldn't make a choice. It's rare that a place goes beyond to make your first time special and wanted us a bite of their star curry dish, try some of their banging carrot cake, brought us favorite hot sauces that pair well with what we ordered. It adds a depth of warmth and thoughtfulness that normally is reserved for regulars and even then is lost on many establishments. Something I expect from  ungodly pricey places, but isn't always delivered. Drinks were always topped off and we were checked on in a very present but not overbearing way. Also when we were handling the check, our ice teas were still to the top and he asked if we would like to take them in to-go cups with us and since it was delish of course we did. It was a nice touch. He also showed us their dinner and brunch menus and hoped we enjoyed everything and come see them to try out their other menus. 

I have been stingy with 5 stars, and almost never give first visits a 5, but this IS as good as it gets! One of the better dining experiences I've had in this city. Vibrant, exciting food, lovely atmosphere and thoughtful service. I put off going because I never have a reason to be in this part of town, but with a experience this strong this IS the reason to come out of the way here, and come back fast. It may even have to be this weekend.

"A feast worthy of Gods"

Baccarnal Buffet in Caesar Palace is consider the best buffet in the Las Vegas by most food critics   It rated highest in trip advisor and yelp for a buffet restaurant in Vegas.  I was only going to eat Buffet once in this trip, so I decided must try the best there is available.  My review is based on late breakfast and lunch during a non-holiday weekday.  Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip.  

Admission Price
*Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99
*Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99
* Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99
* Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends 
* Holiday expect to paid $10 more.
* Total Reward Card Holder gets $1 off.
* Price not included the 8.1% sales tax.

Atmosphere
The interior is similar to those of mid-level restaurant, they claim it cost 17 million that might not felt like it perhaps they included all the equipment and kitchen tools in to the cost.  There is a lot of seating, but do not count it those do not mean anything during dinner and weekend which can get full very quick.  The dessert section is separate counter from the rest of the food.

Customer Service
We got assign an individual server, at first she was helpful but quickly kind of forgot our table.  This was not during a weekday lunch so is not busy; there is was still several table empty.  Imagine in dinner or weekend, the service might be worst. The nicest thing is that they did not enforce the 2 hours eating time limit as they normally do in a busy time.   During peak hours, you would need to get an estimated waiting time in a kiosk machine, 

Beverage
You can to choose variety of juice and coffee.  Some yelper was right that the juice they serving were no longer freshly squeezed, but instead are concentrate and probably are pre-made package.  At this price tag, they should had keep the fresh juice instead of during the cheap way.  I was told that the Mexico Section would had fresh juice and Hocharta but never came out.

Breakfast
The item in the breakfast was the best part of the hot food section I think.  The typical American favorite food like Scramble Egg and Fried Chicken are just perfect in term of texture and flavor.  The dim sum was disappoint, it tasted like those cheap takeout place. 

Seafood
At this price they don't had crab leg for lunch, I heard Aria is the only in the strip serve cheaper.  I can settle with no crab leg as long the other item in the seafood make up for it.  However, it failed to impress me at all.  The got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, looks good but tasted plain.  Probably the worst jumbo shrimp I've tasted.  The oyster was small and wasn't much flavor either, lack freshness.  The smock salmon was not that great either, they got three version and all were no good.  Sushi was ok, I like the sushi rice it was authentic one, however the tuna wasn't good.  But salmon was alright.  There was no specialty or hand roll here.

Noodle Section
Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think.  They use pre-packed noodle, not even the good kind.  I try their Ramen, they use nissin kinds of noodle.  The broth was supposed to be Tonkotsu it tasted more like Shoyu.  There was tiny slice of chashu.  If they wanted to had this type of item, better get it right.  The pho was slight better but still no even close to the real Pho you can from any shop in L.A.

Meat Section
I tried their sausage and beef ribs, it was mediocre at best.  The person that cutting the meat is cool with smile.  There was no lamb chop for lunch, but they do serve prime ribs. The best food in the hot section were the sliders, those were mouthwatering.   I should had get more of those.  I think the burger were prime meat it was extreme flavorful.  Actually, it tasted better than the Gordon Ramsey Hell Burger, which later I eat that night.  The made to order taco wasn't good.  It tasted like king taco and other cheap taco place.

Dessert Section
They dessert has variety of food but nothing really won me over except one item.  Their made to order crepes were the best dessert easily. Fresh and with the right texture, I added the ice cream which was heavenly match.  Their Crme brle was too watery.

Fruit and Salad
They were pretty good in general, Large selection of salads.  You won't get disappoint here.  Just wish they were more fruits.

My 2 Cents
To be honest I am debating giving this 4 or 3 stars, I ended gave a four since there few dish were excellent and the best I had (Sliders, Crepes, Fried Chicken) .  But many other dish were average and even bad..  The price is the problem, they need to better quality and included more crab leg or lamb chop to worth the price.  I didn't get any food sickness after eating here over 2 hours which is a good sigh that the food is prepare it right.

I purchased a yelp deal ($12 for $20) a while ago and attempted to eat here close to a month ago, but the power was out so the girl who was inside said she wouldn't be able to serve us since they had no power to cook with. Bummed since I had this place on my radar due to all of the positive yelp reviews and the the food sounded good, I understood and figured we'd just come back another time. Fast forward to a few days ago when hubby and I decided to give this place a try again. This time the power was on yay! Walking in it is confusing because there is no sign saying to seat your self or to wait to be seated. After standing there for a few minutes and seeing no employees I decided we would just seat ourselves. There were already a couple other filled tables, so I figured the employees might have been taking care of their orders in the back and it turns out there was just one girl working the whole floor and one cook in the back. Once she noticed we were there she did check on us often and was very friendly. Inside has mostly purple walls and bright red booths. It's obvious they are going for a Mardi Gras theme, but it could have been done better. Most of the decor has signs on it that say "for sale" since they are closing at this location.

I ordered what was probably the most simple thing on the menu, but it was what sounded good. Priced at $6.95 (regular size) I ordered the "Royal Street" and priced at $2.95 the "Bananas Fosters Rue Royal" for dessert. 

My sandwich came with a side of Cajun Fries and Coleslaw. The coleslaw was crunchy and had just the right amount of dressing tossed in it so it wasn't dry or soggy. The problem with the coleslaw though was it had absolutely no flavor at all and after three bites I put it aside. I was surprised at the side of fries since the menu said it came with a side of "Cajun Chips" and after seeing the pictures on yelp, I was really looking forward to trying them. Now let me get to the fries. The fries were absolutely perfect! The fries were cooked just right and whatever seasoning they put on them tasted really great. I wished I had no coleslaw and all fries. I don't know what the Cajun Chips tasted like, but i'm sure the Cajun Fries I had made up for it. 

The sandwiches come in regular and large sizes. The Royal Street is a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich. If you want your sandwich "dressed" you will get the addition of lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and pickles. Since I ordered a grilled cheese I wondered how that would turn out, but our server said it was one of her favorite sandwiches on the menu and it is really good with the additions, so I went for it. I have to first say that I really did enjoy my sandwich and would totally eat it again. Now let me say that the sandwich just wasn't what the menu described. There was nothing grilled about it. The bread was extremely good. I mean the bread was so soft and tasty and still held the fillings in nicely. I did order a grilled cheese though and the bread had no grill marks and there was nothing crunchy about the bread. The kids menu even mentions that if your kids have a hard time eating crunchy bread to let them know, but a kid would have no problem eating the bread on the sandwich I had. I also kept hearing the microwave going off and the door opening and closing and when hubby asked me how they got the cheese on both pieces of bread melted if they didn't grill it, the whole noise of the microwave came to my mind. I don't know that's what they did, but the sandwich wasn't at all a grilled cheese. 

When I ordered the Bananas Fosters Rue Royal for dessert and I heard our server tell the cook the order, I heard the microwave start up again. I think they were heating up the bananas maybe. This was a decent dessert. I wish there was more bananas it it, but hubby and I both enjoyed sharing it and there was a nice big scoop of ice cream in it that was perfect for sharing. 

I asked our server about the chips/fries switch up and she said that they signed a 6 year lease, but wont be able to stay at the location they are in because the whole building will be coming down with the expansion of the freeway. She said that the owner is unfortunately going through some health problems right now and between that and moving locations (if they can find one she says) some of the menu isn't available right now. If you are craving alligator or Cajun chips you are out of luck. They wont be serving them and some other items until they figure out where and if they are moving. The girl was very nice and like I said I did like my food aside from the coleslaw, but it would have been better for the server to let us and every customer know what is and isn't available on the menu so they aren't disappointed when they get something else on their plate or have to pick something else to eat and look over the menu again. I hope they do find another location and work out the kinks because I'd try them again in the future.
