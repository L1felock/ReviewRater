OMG! I'm hooked on the fried pizza. Don't judge. It's DELICIOUS! 

When we were in southern Italy a few summers ago, we enjoyed panzerotti -- blurring cultures for the sake of description: they taste like a fry bread empanada filled with tomato sauce, basil and loads of cheese. 

I found recipes once I returned but, truth be told, I suck at frying. 

Imagine my delight when I saw the fritta ($12.95) on the menu at Pomo! 

Quadruple that delight when a "panzerotti" no less than FOUR TIMES the size of what I had in Puglia was delivered to my table! 

With each bite, the rich flavor of the fried crust melts into the sweetest tomato sauce in the Valley, complimented by a burst of basil and stretchy, milky cheese!

My heart HEARTS Dr. Battersby. And, well, so does the rest of me. What? A doctor who actually spends time with me? A doctor, seemingly, genuinely concerned? A doctor who takes my blood pressure and doesn't leave it to the nurse? I was a bit nervous upon entry, as the waiting area, is, well, it's kinda ghetto. Perhaps not ghetto. But sort of like someones basement TV room. But it's the nurturing that counts and Dr. B is the man! He wrote my prescription for my soaring blood pressure (hey, it's genetic! BACK OFF! I'M NOT A STRESSFUL PERSON!)...Oh damn, I need a cup of chamomile and a foot massage. Rickie!!!!

I really like the pedicure at Furama, and they're the only salon I let put glitter polish on my piggies.

Sometimes their state of the art massage chairs alternate between goosing and squeezing my bum.

Sometimes, when you order the callous removal, they grate a hole in your foot with that cheese grating tool, and sometimes they don't... but the pedicure is so good you'll be back.

Their tagline should be: Furama Nails - So good, you wont care when we cheese-grate a hole into your foot.

I have now attended a few events at Wrigley, or "The Mansion" as I like to call it. 

"What are you doing tonight?"
"Oh I am attending a little soiree at 'The Mansion." 

I want to live here,,,and be Batman...maybe Iron Man, I haven't decided for sure. 

Go here. Be Tony Stark, or Bruce Wayne for the night.

There is something indescribably awesome about donning the pocket square and having drinks and socializing in a friggin masion.

The drinks tend to be pricey but if they weren't I don't know if I would feel nearly as cool being here. 

When I live here I will throw crazy UYEs so you should all be prepared to dress the nines and party all night.

Rooms at LVH are inexpensive, additional amenities are very much the opposite (wireless is thirteen dollars a day, a single quart of Crystal Geyser is four), rooms are clean and pleasant, et cetera, you can read about that stuff in any of these reviews. 

More important than any of that is the sheer amount of nipple slippage going on outside. If you are lucky enough to have a room facing the pool, park yourself in front of a giant picture window 'round happy hour and check out the free boob show*. 

Three stars!

*or maybe show a little restraint and don't act like a huge creep/me. Whatever floats your boat.

I was unimpressed today with this do it yourself (DIY) car wash. 

It was a nice touch having a credit card accepting swipper to go with that Quarter eating dial apparatus that starts at $1.75

However the water pressure is low and the "Spotless" setting is sadly all but ineffective.  In a hard water area like greater Phoenix, you would think they could get this right.

Ok, so now that I have your attention, let's talk about Cafe Teaze. It's a cross between a boba shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop, to some extent. What the knockout for me is their plain milk tea, it is extraordinary. The tea flavor is unmistakably noticeable without being overwhelming. Cafe Teaze unquestionably makes some of the best boba in town. Soft on the outside with a slight chew on the inside, it is carried out to magnificence!

Truthfully, The boba babes in their bikini's and lingerie's are another reason to pop in this budding enterprise. Not only do they look terrific, but they are welcoming and attentive. But please everyone, don't be a male copulatory organ and just come here just to look at the girls, order something like a drink or some food, it's still a business!!!

So in conclusion:

Knock! Knock!
Who's There?
Teaze.

Five reasons to visit The Library strip club:

1. Ok it's a dive bar, but topless.  Nice twist ;)
2. Gotta love the sense of irony they seem to have.  There is a row of bookshelves on each side as you enter.
3. The numbers: $10 cover, $6 beers, $8 mixed drinks, $20 lap dances 
4. The girls are ok, sort of like Chili's waitresses, cute but certainly not breathtaking
5. East Side represent, 95 and Boulder Hwy.  If you're staying downtown or coming from Arizona it could make for a pleasant diversion.

Oh and #6: Where were you?  I was at "the library" baby, just catching up on some motherflippin' Dostoevsky.  Crimes and punishment indeed.

Or in this case, "NO MORE DANGLING ELECTRICAL WIRES OVER MY DESK BECAUSE THEY ARE FREAKING ME OUT!"

Yeah. Something like that.

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

This beautiful preserve in located in the middle of one of Gilbert's extensively developed residential areas and is designed to be both a wildlife sanctuary and a groundwater recharging area.  It's a great place to hike, bike, or just stroll and enjoy the tranquility and the beauty of nature. A trail system loops around Water Ranch Lake and seven ponds, and the availability of water results in the maintenance of a more lush vegetative community than you would expect in this region. The lake, ponds, and abundance of vegetation also provide habitat for a lot of wildlife, and indeed this is a bird watcher's paradise. There are picnic areas and restrooms, and children can play in the play area or dig for "fossils" in the Dino Dig area. My friend and I are thankful that the preserve allows dogs (as long as they are on a leash) and even provides "mutt mitts" for cleaning up.

By far my favorite place in Vegas to see a concert. With the "beach like" lighting and palm trees, mixed with the surroundings of city center this venue is truly the best of both worlds. Ive seen numerous shows here such as Death Cab For Cutie, Foster The People, and Ben Iver. And those I can honestly say were 3 of my favorite concerts ever. How do they have a concert in the pool you ask? they drain it of course :) Also with amazing backdrops for photo opps, you cant go wrong with this place.

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem. 

The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, "It's the best Jerry, the best!" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia. 

If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food.

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

The store is huge with racks upon racks of earlier / last season items straight from the racks of Dillards. This center and the one in metro center mall both receive merchandise from all southwest US dillards stores, according to one iffy sales representative.

I scored with a 5 discounted Murano, Calvin Klein, and Perry Ellis shirts, 2 or 3 sweaters, a jacket, a pair of dress pants, 4 packages of new mens "under garments", and a pair of dockers shorts for about $150 after tax. A bargain shoppers delight - you just can't go wrong!

I've been to a few Tommy Bahamas over the years, mostly on the west coast.  Their clothes are of a very high quality and trendy.  Particularly if you you are walking off a beach or are in the island setting. That is not a snarky comment, but a statement on their style and appearance.  I like the look very much and was surprised that they had an outlet store.

Virtually everything in the store is marked at 50% off, see photo. I also liked the steel drummer playing as you come to get you in the mood.  Very nice!

I had a very immediate need to print something that someone had emailed to me and I was too far away from home to go back there. Here's FedEx/Kinko's to the rescue!

Sign in to their workstation with a credit card swipe, bring up the email, print the email, sign out. $1.32 and done. I didn't have to wait in line and I didn't even have to deal with a clerk.

Note: I do not suggest that anyone ever use one of these public "kiosk" machines to access your email account. Instead, create a "throwaway" mailbox and forward and sign in to that one. This is how hackers get access to your mailbox - by capturing the letters you type on a public keyboard! With doodads like this: http://www.amazon.com/Keyllama-4MB-USB-Value-Keylogger/dp/B004ZGXU48

Much creamier, smoother, denser & better tasting than Luv it custard. But it started to melt pretty quickly after receiving it from the front cashier. 

Got the caramel pecan concrete custard very creamy. The pecans were yummy & gave it a great texture to the custard. It was a bit on the extreme sweet side. 3.5 stars

Chocolate malted walnut was pretty good but the malt gave it a funny taste & the walnuts were not fresh. 2.5 stars

Lime rickey was yummy tasted like a lime & cream popsicle.

Overall taste: B - (can be a too sweet...after a couple bites, I was on a major sugar rush). -1

Service: A (helpful) 

Inside decor: A (very kool with all kinds of 50s memorabilia)

The Heard Museum is probably one of the best we have ever been in!

The history of the indigenous First Nation people in North America is both sad and very compelling.  And, the collection the Heard family has assembled and the museum has added to is incredible.  Yet, it's the little exhibits that move me the most.  I am still brought to tears whenever at the end of touring, I come to the hand crafted dolls of the US Marine WWII Navajo code talkers raising the American flag (See photos).

On our most recent trip here, we enjoyed the Barry Goldwater Bolo Tie exhibit, and  listening to the tour guide of First Nation peoples in Arizona.

BTW, the best deal is becoming a Member of the Heard by showing your AAA card.  It's a small discount but you get their magazine and newsletter.

There are three free tram systems that operate on the west side of the strip. They're a great alternative to the $5 a ride monorail that runs on the east side. Working north, you can get from Mandalay to Excalibur. Get off at Excalibur and cut through New York New York. Enter the Monte Carlo and jump the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram. I think this one is the more impressive of the trams. While you're waiting for the Monte Carlo tram you can ogle people lounging around Monte Carlo's pool. 

Beat that Toronto Transit!

After getting off at the Bellagio, you can cut through Caesar's Palace and get to the Mirage. At the Mirage you can board the third tram north to the pretty damn ghetto Treasure Island. And from Treasure Island you can then cross the road to the Fashion Show mall.

This is your typical Barnes & Noble's large footprint store.  I am unsure if this is their largest store, the one in Chandler Fashion seems larger.

Barnes & Nobles suffers from the same affliction as Best Buy.  If Best Buy is Amazon's showroom, then so is B & N.  The book industry has changes quite a bit over the years, due primarily to the internet.  Gone are the Borders of the world, a friendlier and easier to maneuver store.  But if you are looking for volume and sheer size, this might be the best place.

We have been coming to this B & N for the last five years.  All the employees are very helpful, and Four Stars in my opinion.  It's convenient for from my office and it seems as if we're in here at least twice a month on weekends.  

I know at this point,  I am tired of the Nook sales pitch as you come through the door.  At some point, I'm sure Microsoft will just buy the other 50% they do not own and that will end it. Hopefully.

So in summary, this Barnes & Nobles is Thee Stars, A-OK.

At 10:30pm i was craving this : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=t-ZAZpB7Uu2tdh_Wl2VRuA
Creme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.  If i stayed at the Bellagio or Aria, i know i would have a dozen check ins stocking up on breakfast pastries, chocolate snacks and late night desserts! Danger!

We stopped here for dinner before catching the performance of HAIR at the Herberger Theater with Amanda B. and her sister. This pub / restaurant has a quaint laid back atmosphere and quite a few brews on tap Guinness, Bass , etc; I chose a pint of Smithwick's to accompany my dinner. 

The menu has traditional Irish fair like Corned Beef, Sheppard's Pie, as well as burgers, salads and sandwiches. I went the safe route and had a Swiss Cheese Mushroom burger which went well with the pint I ordered. I liked the fact that the burger was 1/3 pound and had a decent flavor. 

Seamus' has a great downtown location, half a block off the light rail. The majority of the menu is priced under $10 and quite an array of offerings so everyone should find something they like.

Visitors who don't hike a lot and who are just looking for a casual and a good workout hike, read this. I repeat, read this. This part of Camelback Mountain is for you. Only do Echo Canyon if you are up for hoisting yourself up with your hands and climbing boulders. This hike doesn't have that. This hike is simple hiking up a mountain. It's best to wear hiking shoes to help with traction, but the most strenuous part of the hike is getting a stair master workout with climbing up over small rocks. Parking can be tough so it's best to go during off hours or park further away and walk. Dogs are welcome and on a clear day, the views are nice!

Never one to jerk you around and spring up "surprise service" charges,  he's a man that's good on his word. Plus he's hilariously amusing and wears too much orange.

Ultra Roof and Exteriors is licensed to do both residential and commercial roofing and they do both well. Joe is knowledgeable, patient, and knows his trade inside and out.  So if your roof is fixing for, well, a fixing, call Joe!

As a Minnesota native I've had the pleasure of seeing my Vikings reach four Super Bowls. Well, I didn't see them in the first one, cuz I was barely an embryo at the time. But I was glued to the screen for three of those championship games. 
We lost the first one. 
And the second.
No shit. We lost the third.
Fourth times a charm though, right? In my best Whitney, "Oh hell to the NO!"
Zero for four. Just like Mclean Stevenson sitcom career. 

So Cardinals. YEA! Kickass and Woo Freakin' Hoo Baby! I'm stoked for the big game. How ironic it could be that the 2nd most losingest franchise in all of sports history (second only to the Cubs) may give me the joy of my first Super Bowl win.

OH MAH GAWD!

Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.

So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.

Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them! 

Their website touts "We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!" It is OBVIOUSLY true.

I love The Tamale Store!!!

Book & Stage is a small bar near the lobby of the Cosmopolitan. After spending 3 nights at the hotel and hitting the bar a couple times, it was a-ok as a hotel bar, but there wasn't any live performances in the evenings, the book portion is small, and there are better bars at the Cosmopolitan. 

The bartenders are nice and all ... like most drink slingers in Las Vegas. No complaints about the service; however, both visits we left and headed elsewhere cause the place was practically empty. When there aren't any live performances on the small stage, then perhaps the niche Book and Stage fills in as a quieter bar choice than other Cosmopolitan hot spots.

An exclusive restaurant in a restaurant serving outstanding teppanyaki.

No knife juggling.  No onion volcano spewing fire.  No shrimp tails flying through the air.  This is about modern Japanese teppanyaki made with the freshest, highest quality, visually stunning ingredients.  No "ugly" produce; a perfectly formed, evenly colored eggplant, baby bok choy with no holes in the leaves, you get the idea.

To start, the spicy octopus is incredible.  Lightly grilled with slivered jalapeno peppers, sweet, spicy, tender.  Borrowing from the menu of barMasa, the otoro with osetra caviar, absolutely phenomenal, the salty, brininess of the caviar enhancing the fatty fish.

Australian wagyu for mains.  Two cuts (fillet or rib eye), both approaching A4 quality.  The fillet is well trimmed, the rib eye, less so,  If you like to savor the fat around the edge of your steak, this cut is for you.  Tender, juicy, cooked to temperature, served with a spicy cilantro verde that brightens and intensifies the sweetness of the beef and a spicy red chili and soy that brings out the savory, beefy flavor.

For sides, it's hard to pass the maitake with truffle butter.  An umame explosion that works well with the beef.

Finally, the wagyu fried rice (a filler) is different and over the top.  Black and red rice are combined to create a nuttier flavor.  Fat from the wagyu adds richness, onions sweetness. 

Service is excellent with two servers assisting a single table.  

The restaurant shares the same outstanding sake list as barMasa.  Vegas resort pricing.

While not up to the standards of Michelin rated teppanyaki restaurants of Tokyo, Tetsu delivers a solid, authentic experience at a far more reasonable price.

When "discount outlets" started appearing about 20 years ago, they were great!  Now, not so much. 

In the beginning, it was a great way for stores to get rid of their overstocked merchandise. Now, they have just added extra lines just for this distribution channel.  See my review of Coach Outlet. http://www.yelp.com/biz/coach-factory-outlet-glendale#hrid:aIViAW1uXVxHIBB12qoIAA

Polo is no exception. Men's button down Oxford shirts are advertised as $64.99, less a special store discount of an additional 30% off. I have never been here when there wasn't a special store discount of 30% off!  

Okay, so about $46 or so. Both, Dillard's and Macy's have nearly the identical discounts and pricing. Second, rather than the heavy duty 100% cotton Oxford shirts, they are now carrying a lighter weight blend for similar prices. A knock-off if you will of their own product. Wow!

So why shop at an Outlet, when your favorite major retailer can meet or beat these prices?  

In the future, I will take a pass.  Sorry!

Vanguard has been at the forefront of the low cost/ low management fee mutual fund movement started by John Bogle some forty plus years ago. 

Bogle's philosophy was based in part on the concepts put forth by the University of Chicago Nobel economist Harry Markowitz. It stated that the stock market was truly efficient, and therefore impossible to outperform through stock selection.  Instead, Vanguard offers an Index approach to overcome this conundrum.

Today, the equity markets have embraced the Index fund movement.  No longer is Vanguard just Index'er, but have grown to include ETFs and annuities as well.  Though headquartered back east in Pennsylvania, their Scottsdale complex is huge.  I've found it equally impressive driving past there at 6 am and seeing the entire parking lot full.

As Harry Markowitz proved, it is was impossible to outperform the market by timing your purchases of stocks, so consider an index instead. Yes, I am a fan.

Quality ramen with a twist.  A newcomer to the ramen scene.  This time on the East side.  Ain't nothing wrong with that.

Noodles - hardly seasoned but chewy.  Check.
Chashu - tender porky goodness.  Check.
Salt, soy, miso, spicy broths.  Check, check, check, check.
Ramen that showcases it all - very flavorful "Fukumimi" (tonkotsu topped with everything).  Check.

So what sets it apart from the big boys, Sora and Monta?  Tantan Men; a simple, almost naked bowl of noodles swimming in an exceptional spicy sesame broth.   The broth is so intense, you can't see the noodles through its mustard yellow liquid.  Tender baby bok choi breaks the one dimensional texture.  Thanks you Godzilla X for bringing this elixir to my attention. 

PC Tip:  While manners dictate you should drink all the ramen broth,  those with a weak constitution or first time connoisseurs should make an exception for very rich and spicy tantan men.   Just sayin.

Excellent chicken karaage (crisp with the hint of ginger flavor).  Good curry rice (strong with bits of tender pork).  NO GYOZA.  NO TONKATSU.

A very worthy addition to Vegas' ramen scene.

I think this place is the real reason that Jude is sad.  

I wanted to like it, because I love the Beatles and adore pretty neon lights.

BUT - the free promotional drinks that lured my friends and I here were hosted by Pink Vodka - a liquor that, although beautifully bottled, is disgusting and tastes like rubbing alcohol.

The drinks weren't pink, but I noticed my toenail polish was when I bent over to throw up the cheap vodka later in the evening.

My standards are pretty low, so to NOT meet them really says something.

To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy.

If you have been lucky enough to go to a Broadway play in New York, then you might recognize the Herberger a close cousin. 

We really enjoy this theatre and have been here many times. It's so much like a real Broadway one in setup and size, but only nicer and updated.  The seats are large and there is no bad one in the house.  

I would highly recommend you signup for the Arizona Theatre Company's email blast.  Or if you can afford it, their season packages aren't too expensive and are quite reasonable.

Just like in the Goodwill commercial! I swear! You've all seen the commercials right? The customer arrives, ask where, oh, a power drill would be...Goodwill employee says in the tool section and points. Then we see the giddy customer trying on hats, sipping air from a coffee mug, settling into a recliner and finding a backyard croquet set. 

Upon check out the same employee asks "Did you find what you were looking for?" Cut to the giddy customer with a cart heaping full of Goodwill goodies...or as I call them...Goodwillies...and he replies rather happily, "Nope!"

Rickie and I were looking for a bicycle. Did we leave with a bicycle? Nope. But I scored some fabulous seemingly brand new throw pillows for ten bucks.

Although we didn't stay in one of the rooms at Wynn, we spent a lot of time there. Le Reve was spectacular, Okada was amazing, Blush was swanky, The Buffet was decadent. All the staff we encountered was wonderful and friendly. Whether it was waiting in the buffet line, or sitting out by the valet while waiting for a friend to pick us up, we were brought water while we waited. If only they offered us cocktails as well, I would give them a 6th star. 

Wynn glows like gold in the sunlight and makes a bold statement at night. It's amazing that Steve Wynn was able to design it, being nearly blind. Yeah, maybe some of the decor is flashy and colors clash, but it must be hard to dictate colors and patterns to him.

Luxurious and glamorous, you wouldn't expect anything less from the man who transformed The Strip.

As my first venture out after being diagnosed celiac I was not disappointed with their gluten free items! Walking into Greens & Protiens has a very homelike clean feel. It almost seems like it should be in Southern California. They have a large assortment of healthy items on their menu such as shakes, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. I decided to try the green leaf berry blast shake (carrots, kale, berries, spinach, soy milk, agave nectar, and vanilla extract) I've been every day for the past 5 days since for this shake its so delicious! I also tried the Greek pizza on gluten free crust.. YUM! Hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. The crust is actually amazing too it's almost like a flatbread. I will be suggesting this place to everyone and I can't wait for their 2nd location on Flamingo and the 215 to open! See you all there :)

I love Paris, but don't love the Vegas version of the hotel.  Sure it has the Eiffel Tower, the Montgolfier Balloon, and the Arc de Triomphe.  Sure it has one of my favorite restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi, and a terrific buffet.  Sure, if your room faces the Blvd then you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  But the hotel and casino is not good for one reason only -- SMOKERS.

You have to walk by the bar to go to/fro your room or buffet, and be hit square in the nose with smoke.  Why don't they build another place for SMOKERS and enclose it in glass so they can kill themselves?  Instead, it's unavoidable madness.

If you are a SMOKER, then it's great.  Highly recommended.

What a great little antique store in Phoenix, AZ.  One of the first things that I noticed about this little shop is that IT SMELLS GOOD!!!  The place is clean and well kept - not like many of the typical antique shops.  Kudos to the owner, Gary for maintaining such a pleasurable shop!

The shop is filled with tons of goodies - raning from turquoise jewelry, lamps, period-era memorabilia, photos, etc.  While in Phoenix, I visited over 15 antique shops, and this one took the cake!  Prices are reasonable, and the customer service is outstanding!  Very pleasant to deal with and no pushy salespeople.

I went in looking for a turquoise cowboy belt buckle, and left with some snazzy Zuni Indian turquoise cufflinks.  SNAZZY!

It's the usual Jimmy John's faire, but slightly less expensive ('bout 50 cents) than their Chandler Fashion location. Now I love JJs, but I need to take them down a half star for all the nonsense going on inside the store.  

It's very much like the old high school cafeteria. Employees yelling at each other, goofing around and tunes dial up to ear splitting decibels, which makes it hard to enjoy a meal here.

This place has been listed on Dirty Dining (a Las Vegas news segment) back in May of this year for having 40 demerit points, which is one point from being shut down in Las Vegas.

I don't know about you, but if a restaurant is EVER featured on a show like this for the same reasons that HAG was, it's pretty much dead to me. They can claim to have changed, but from what I see anytime I want past the place, it hasn't...

Toys R Us is to kids as Bass Pro Shops is to adults. If you love firearms, camping, knives, fishing, golfing, hiking, boating, hunting, ATV's, archery, or all of the above, this store is for YOU. Literally, every time we go to Vegas I have to stop at this Bass Pro Shops to stock up on ammo. Conveniently found next next to I-15 on Blue Diamond Road, Bass Pro Shops is my welcome committee to Las Vegas from California.

On my last visit we walked the store and found our way towards the giant aquariums and the mermaid painting exhibits at the Silverton Casino connection. What can I say, my wife likes mermaids. After looking at mermaids and stocking up on ammo, I found my way towards the crossbows on the second floor. I fell in love with a Parker Compound Crossbow. I think I found my new hubby to compliment shooting.

If are visiting Vegas, love the outdoors, and have not been to Bass Pro Shops, stop by and enjoy a good walk through this great store.

Nowadays, Michael Kors is the IT Brand.  Folks are posting about it on Facebook, Instagram etc. It's popularity was evident too when I stopped by this outlet on a busy Saturday,  There were lots of folks admiring the different bags, wallets, tech accessories and jewelry.

The deals at this outlet store were good! They had different special offers! It was nice to see some of the newest styles offered at a discounted price as well. They even were offering MK lipstick at a special price (I didn't know MK had makeup! So cool!)

I did not buy the lipstick, but I did end up with a nice watch in a style I've never seen before. I was happy with my purchase and happy with this store. It's nice to find good deals and different, unique styles that are not easily found elsewhere.

GETTING MY ASIAN BBQ FIX

It's been at least three years since we had last visited this Hong Kong style deli noodle house. As the Las Vegas Asian community has grown exponentially during the past two decades, this sort of restaurant fulfills a most important culinary appetite for rice plates and noodles with barbeque deli meats. In Chinese communities throughout the world it is an essential food business on every block. Breakfast is the rice porridge or congee while afternoon and evenings are rice plates and bowls of noodles of all  varieties. Here at Asian BBQ & Noodles it's no different.

It's the Asian version of McDonalds...with one exception, it's better and never boring.

I've seen the original Phantom of the Opera in NY & the acting & singing in this performance is just not as good but the decor, costumes, set & pyrotechnic work that they had here during this show was just AMAZING & AWESOME!! =)
They made the show look more like the movie rather than the original Broadway show... =) I'm just disappointed that they had cut a lot of the singing out compared to the original version..probably to get you onto the casino floor 2 loose more money 2 the casino..hahhaa... =)

OVERALL, if you LOVE Broadway Shows & The Phantom of the Opera, this is a definite MUST see.. =)

This review based on my experience in their gas station, this one only got like four or five gas dispenser.  That is like half compare what I used to in other location.  This reason is probably why there is very long line when we came here. The other problem, there were only one gas dispenser in the line.  Seriously, they need to add more dispenser.  This is one of the cheapest gas station near the strip is probably another factor why is so crowded, having less dispenser is not helping at all.

Partied too hard?  You know, dinner, ultra lounge, casino gaming for pre-gaming, a club, an after hours club.  Mobile filled with numbers of people called "the hot one", "the hot hot one", "the hottest one".  Enter Japanese Curry Zen; cure for a hangover and tragically lighter money clip.

The dish is simple.  Rice with plain curry topped with mostly deep fried goodies.

Ordering:
1.  Choose the size:  small $3.75, regular $5.95, or extra rice plus $1.00.
2.  Choose the heat level (this is Japanese not Thai.  J-Level 10 = T-Level 4 AND the taste is altered).
3.  Select toppings (braised beef, chicken, pork or tofu katsu, deep fried shrimp, potato croquette, or vegetables); $2.00 - $6.50.
4.  Done.

Typical Japanese curry (viscous, vegetable base with a complex, aromatic blend of Indian spices and a gentle heat).  No coconut milk, no painful chilies in the mix.  Everyday quality short grain white or brown rice.  The braised beef, tender, fall apart goodness.  The fried items, crunchy on the outside, correctly cooked on the inside.  The veg, cooked to death, very soft and lending their flavor to the mix.  A single order of any topping is enough to fill most up.  Typical offering of pickled veg and raisins at the table.

Multiple visits, very consistent.

A simple meal, done right.

And Presidents received oral sex in the oval office. Yes, that long!

If I can bring home a burrito that satisfies my man and reminds him of home....well, let's just say O Freakin Lay Baby! And by lay, I mean, well, tu sabes loco, tu sabes!!!

This is SO unfair. How could I possibly give a bad review to an organization of volunteers whose main purpose is to save our cute canine comrades from the electric chair? Well....here goes. 
It's a very well organized store. I would say it's 85% women's clothing, 10% furniture and accessories and 5% men's clothing. So, really not much for me too look at. And no, I don't have any drag events coming up. Rickie, however, did find a beautiful vintage dress, black lace with a pearl satin lining, that he, no doubt, will turn into a priceless gown. 
But I definitely had to step outside, as the store smelled like the back of my Aunt Helen's stale, mothball riddled closet. Yes, I used to play in her closet....she had more pumps than a truck stop.

They had a BABY JESUS pencil topper set!!! OMG, I think I died and went to heaven. 

Plus they had a photo booth and pirate cupcake wrappers, and oh yeah, they had candy. I found it to be a novelty store that happened to sell candy and other eccentric knick knacks. But whoa, what a bunch of poor reviews I see here. I found Smeeks to be a delight. The scene on a Saturday afternoon was kind of a mob scene -- about a dozen or so people kind of crowded the place.

I spent $5 on my Baby Jesus pencil toppers and found prices on other things to be just right -- it's an independent local business selling specialty goods, people.

So go ahead -- spend your money at another chain to save a buck, kwitcherbitchin and move to Buckeye. Thank you. The End.

I guess the money I paid wasn't enough...I'm like, "Fuck you."

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari...

Clearly, Advantage knows how to TAKE the reservation, they just don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.

Tri Express is the size of a walk-in closet yet packs a ton of personality in both decor and personnel: master sushi chef Tri is friendly (haven't cleaned my hand since shaking his!) and his place is just as bright and welcoming.

And the sushi's delicious.

While this BYOB is a charming date spot, sizable parties may wish to opt for take away. Get the omakase menu to go (no joke). Everything is expertly prepared and packaged, ready to handle the trek to your flat. The sushi is marvelously fresh, the sashimi heavenly, and the flavors creative (try the rice crackers topped with seafood). Plus, there's plenty of wasabi and ginger if needed.

Bring cash.

Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.

Wow. Fail. Really. You just blew it.

I wasn't so concerned or rallied up about the organic aspect as I had my doubts to it's legitimacy. It was the pick up and drop off delivery service that made me get out the gay spray. 

Really. This potential customer, who recently lost a whole bunch of pounds and has a whooooole new wardrobe, is keeping his dry cleaning business at Society Cleaners on Camelback. Shout out...hey...arms in the air...

I called in and inquired about the delivery service. The employee took my address and times that would work for me for dropping off my dry cleaning bags. She also told me she wasn't sure about their schedule as the driver is in college and has different class times. 

What? Like I give a rat's ass if the driver is in college or in Depends. Don't. Care. But I was excited for this new luxury. 

Thursday comes. Three o'clock to five o'clock. Six. Six thirty. No show. Fail. I didn't bother calling back.

The Sliders & Fries were pretty good.  You get a stack of 4 Sliders and a pile of Fries.  The IPA went down smooth with the meal...yum!

Was there during lunch hour on a Saturday, so the wait was short dining at the bar alone.  One of the best things about dining at the bar is that your glass is never empty.....

A complete waste of time and money. This place is nothing but a brick-and-mortar insurance scam. My experience was the worst health-care experience of my life, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I waited in the waiting room for 12 hours.  All they did was draw some blood and told me it would probably be another hour or two. After the 14th hour, I walked out and found a real doctor the next morning with a real prescription pad.

My advice: if you have a medical emergency, stay away from UMC, unless you want an appointment with death.

The conservatory and gardens at the Bellagio are a visual treat throughout the year with changing floral displays and decorations to highlight the different seasons and specific holidays.  With every visit to Las Vegas I've enjoyed this is the one attraction I've visited each time.  This year marked my third visit during the Christmas season.

Polar bears seem to be the highlight this year, but the giant toy rocking horse is the centerpiece of the gardens.  Two sets of toy trains circled the horse and the amazing flower garden surrounding it.  Installed on each train is a live camera aimed towards the viewing areas.  There are video monitors to view what the train's cameras were recording, and all I saw were happy faces from young and old, eyes widened, just enjoying the visual treat.

I took a few photos also that I've posted here:

I took my 2002 Saturn into this shop based on the good reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed.  Bogi is terrific!  I picked her shop because it isn't too far from where I work and they took me to work and picked me up when my car was done. I was tired of going into shops where they tell you need other work done. Bogi explained everything to me. What sold me was I met a man there taking his car in (told me he had a newer car under warranty) and he told me he felt better taking his car into Bogi's place rather than the dealer! She is terrific! Will definitely take my car back to her.

If you are a prude & don't like sex don't come here. 

Theater was very intimate & cosy.

Our balcony seats gave us a great view of all of the acrobatic acts. 

I don't like to strain my neck by looking up all the time. This would be the issue if we were in the orchestra seats.

The show over-exceeded my expectations & kept me entertained the whole way through. 

Tip: if you are a student, call into box office they'll give you 20% off discount on tickets.

If you are not a student, Travelzoo also has deals going on for this show too. 

Show was great visual effect of dancing, singing, live music, sexual innuendos of sexiness.

A Sweet Review for a Sweet club...

1. It was my boy Kent D's birthday and he wanted to party like a Rock Star...indeed we did...twice over.  We got bottle service inside the club and in the middle of the madness which is the best way to rock it out at XS. 

2. Before we got blitz and started fist pumping, we tipped the 300 lb bouncer so he can keep an eye on us and our table. Luckily we did because some guy tried to help himself to one of our Goose and the bouncer put a smack down on his A$$. 

3. There was plenty of talent and a few bums. Get rid of the bums (thanks 300lb bouncer) and keep the talent.

What happened in Vegas was on a few cameras... need to find and delete...

Oh snaaap. If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge. While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.

The restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat.

Cafes sind ja eine Kategorie fr sich.

Es gibt die gemtlichen und die schnieken, die mit eigener Konditorei und die die eher auf Kleinigkeiten setzen. In manchen gibt es sogar selbstgemachte Pralinen.  Und Omas am Nebentisch. Andere wiederum sind eher mit WLAN ausgestattet und bieten im Home Office arbeitenden eine nette Abwechslung.

Das Cafe Jck ist eine fr sich. Der Kuchen in der Vitrine sieht verboten gut aus, gleiches gilt fr die Pralinen und Kleingebcke. Das Interieur quietscht dagegen zwischen allen Stilen. Gemtlichkeit will nicht so recht aufkommen, aber dafr fhlen sich hier unterschiedlichste Menschen willkommen und schaffen gemeinsam eine Atmosphre des aus der Zeit gefallenen Oase fr diese Momente, fr die noch kein Ort geschaffen.

Mein ortskundiger Begleiter tat gut daran, mich hierher zu fhren und sorgte fr seine Bestellung "eine heisse Schokolade 66" fr mein Erstaunen - ja, hier kann man seinen Kakao in Prozent bestellen von milchschokoladig bis dunkelzart. Fr Leute wie mich, die der Milch und dem Gluten fernbleiben drfen fand sich auf Nachfrage in der Vitrine ein Florentiner. Der war eher unspektakulr und ich beneidete die Begleiter um ihren saftigen Himbeerkuchen.

Der Service - well, der Service wre das Argument, das fr mich gegen einen Besuch spricht: Muffelig und alles andere als den prallen Ssswaren gerecht werdend, wurden wir begrsst, bedient und abkassiert. Schade!

Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.

Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.

We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!

So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!

Tapas 101:

A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.
A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.
A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.
Repeat until full.
Siesta.

Don't  be intimidated by the almost 100 selection menu.  

Don't order more than one plate at a time (this isn't dim sum).

Do take your time.  Savor the flavor of simply prepared, quality ingredients.

While the kitchen excels at traditional tapas, do not pass the  tuna-raspberry skewer.  A multi sensory dish opening with the aroma of sesame and essence of raspberry, textural contrast of the silky cube of ahi against the seeds, the contrasting temperature of ingredients.  It just works.

To the traditional.  Top props to the monkfish and pisto.  Beautifully pan seared, moist monkfish paired with a mix of eggplant, zucchini and tomato.  Vinegar adds a good acidic zing that brightens the flavor of the fish.  Excellent mixed seafood ceviche with perfectly "cooked" shrimp, white fish and octopus bathed in lime and cilantro.  Other standouts, gambas a la plancha (prepared head on; oh the head fat..), tender octopus whose oceanic flavor is heightened by the earthy paprika, calamari a la plancha simply dressed in olive oil, and a very simple plate o anchovy fillets.  

Not into seafood?  Excellent rabo de toro (braised oxtail), falling off the bone, served with Iberian pork atop a very creamy, mashed potato, an excellent Iberian pork shoulder with it's deep, porky flavor, and a sublime plate of imported pata negra (ham from the black footed pig).  The hazelnuts of the pig's diet is very prominent in the complex flavor of the ham.

Many repeat visits.  Service is consistently excellent; friendly and accommodating.  

Very good wine list with well focused selection by the glass that pair well with the dishes.  Vegas resport pricing.

Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.

I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806. Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.

In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken. It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food. Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes. In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning. There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.

Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place.

Yes, I hiked! 

And yes, it was awesome...in all respects of that word. 

The industrious and uber-fit Miss Gabi K and her super dog Minnie swept us to Camelback for a mid-morning hike. Beautiful weather. Stunning views.  A brisk, yet accessible hike. I was huffin' and puffin', but hey...I blame the altitude. Or, perhaps it's just that I am not in good shape? I side with the former!  ;) 

It is just beautiful, and was such a fun, cool way to workout, see the scenery and enjoy the sunshine. Yeah, I sound all gurgly and happy...blame it on some actual vitamin D via the big hot dot. Ha! Yes, sun. Amazing. 

Oh, and we saw the San Francisco Giants doing some cross training. HOT. 

Bring water, solid shoes for climbing and a camera. For sure. 

Thanks Gabi!

Emilie, our celebrity Schnauzer, gives Oliver & Annie two paws up. I know. She is adorable. Anyway, this is hands down the sweetest pet boutique. So opposite the juggernaut PetSmart. You are actually greeted with a smile and not a scowl. This place is so cozy you could seriously stand in the middle and see everything in the store. Delightful toys and the cutest puppy apparel. Well. At least until we come out with the VMarie Poochie line. You won't find mainstream dog food here, so don't expect Alpo or Purina. The owners are passionate about animals and quality goods and services. So bring your bitch to Oliver & Annie and have a doggone good time!

Whoot for things I didn't buy in Japan years ago, but are now down the street from me. I will have to physically stop myself from buying everything in here; and I mean, they have everything you could want to be a nerdy Japanese lover.

For one, they have an entire section for Sailor Moon. Enough said on that.

Two, they have all the little knick knacks you could want for bento boxes, and anything remotely cute that you wouldn't otherwise need (I have recently discovered I now must have mini pandas to put on my sandwiches). 

Three, they have a section of imported foods, mostly what you can normally get at any store now that has jumped on the pocky bandwagon- but the most important part about this is that they have Green Tea, Orange, and Hazelnut Kit Kats. Most people will be more interested in the Green Tea ones, but personally I found the orange ones to be very tasty. 

They also carry a section of Japanese imported hair products and such (ie: Electric white hair dye) and some regular Japanese imports like Geisha dolls and dishware. 

It is a very small shop, but most people will be able to find something here to scream about.

Always really love this screwy place & think it's worth the 66 mile round trip from my house.  Today I was joined by Mike C. & Jackie C. and my order was for a Fontina Burger which has 6 oz. of tasty beef, roasted & diced red peppers, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato slices, pickle, onions, farm-made pecan pesto & fontina, whatever that is.  The important thing is that this burger was GREAT, & so were the fries (one of several side choices) that are included with the burger!     :-))

It's okay. I wasn't really blown away. The pizza comes out of the oven freaky fast but I've had better pizzas at Peter Piper. I get that you can pick out your ingredients "Chipotle Style". But realistically, isn't that the standard feature for every other pizza joint? They also serve salads. So I would sum this place up as a poor man's "Sauce".

I'm going to keep this simple review about Trump hotel. One of the best hotel I have ever stay at. Their customer service is excellent.  The entire staff is wonderful. Our room 6400 two bedrooms 2 1/2 bath penthouse suite is outstanding . A perfect view of the entire strip. The room is literally under the letter "R".Their room are kept in excellent condition, and doesn't smell like smoke at all maybe because there is no smoking in the hotel at all. The master bathroom amazing, their king size bed is very comfortable,and great full kitchen,also a huge living room with one of the most comfortable couch ever. Highly recommended.

Note they have a courtesy shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar Palace.

We had dinner here last night with some friends and I'm raising my rating by one star to three. 

Everything I wrote about in my original review is still present and I agree with the Yelp'er who thought Nick's as over rated at best. 

The wine list is sad, with only three choices of Italian reds, all Chanti. No Barolo's, Valpolicella, Sangiovese's, or any super Tuscans. I do realize that chantii is made mostly from the sangiovese varietal, but a simple sangiovese would have been nice. 

Where Nick's has improved in is their fish offerings and the baked Lasagna. Both were very good. But their meat Lasagna, which is made with a flavorful Bolognese sauce, was delicious and worth a trip.

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff. 

My dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am. 
We got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building. 
My dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!! 
Why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!? 

I had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue. 
We got to emergency and she died less then an hour later. 

Thanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

So what if this place is closed... I do miss it. I always enjoy being up close and next to dangerous beasts... I mean look at my friends and enemies... Hell perhaps they are frenemies...  but yeah back to the subject at hand...

I have never seen these lions ever move from a sleeping position out of having seen them like 15+ times. I think the exhibit was closed years before but no one told anyone anything and the lions were mummified by the dry desert air... purportedly they did move now and then at feeding time... or were there strings attached... did anyone see if someone was working a marionette inside the cage?

None the less I do miss gazing upon these magnificent beasts. I do love big cats quite a bit so I am sad that they removed them. However I am happy to be out of the danger zone at the same time... perhaps someday they will return to the Metro Goldwyn Meyer casino...

Time for my annual update of Ashley at Salon Ami... and guess what? She still ROCKS!  Not only have I always been satisfied with my hair cut, highlights, and blow jobs (yes, I meant to say that - trying to be funny here)... but Ashley also does wedding hair, and she does it well!

On the morning of my wedding, Ashley (and her assistant) came to the hotel where I got married to do wedding hair for me, my bridesmaids, my mom, mother-in-law, and grandmother... although Ashley does up-do styles, we all chose to wear our hair down or just partially up.  We were all pleased with our hair, which says a lot since Ashley managed to work with long hair, short hair, thick hair, thin hair, curly hair, and straight hair... it just goes to show that she does it all!

Ashley is actually getting married herself soon and I only hope she has someone doing her hair on her special day that is half as amazing as she is!

Winter in Phoenix, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. When I am sweating in 120 degree summer weather, I think longingly to the 7 months out of the year that are a delicious 75 degrees. 

I love the smell of winter in Phoenix, yes the smell. It smells like orange blossoms and this perfume scent surprises me with every twist and turn. 

While I hate how they drive (can we please have a driving lane designated for snow birds?), I love how they make the streets come alive and make the businesses, events and festivals come together for entertainment of every shape and size. 

I love that I can wear sundresses in December. 

I love how I can climb Camelback Mountain in the dead of winter wearing nothing but shorts and a light pullover. 

I love all the events that happen, including the Fiesta Bowl, WM Open, Barrett Jackson and Spring Training. 

I love waking up in the morning and opening up my doors to a fresh breeze and birds chirping. 

I love that I can host parties on my patio in December. 

I love that I can read a book on my patio in December. 

I don't live the cost of living in the winter, but I do love that because of the tourist population in the winter months, the resorts can offer steal of deals in the summer for their loyal locals. 

I don't care what your opinion of Phoenix is. This city has amazing weather the majority of the year, tourists flock here to visit and we have every type of terrain just a drive away. #liveandlovelocal

I am spoiled now and will probably only view future movies at a Galaxy Theater. I don't live close to either one however I find the trek is worth it. The standard ticket cost $11 which is about the same as anywhere else. I usually go to see movies at The Palms which is $10.50 so no big deal. Unless you go to The Palms on a Monday when it is $5, anyhow lol. 

I love the assigned seating, I love the big spacious comfy lazyboy like reclining seats. I mean I was literally like laying down watching the movie! They have big trays where you can put your stuff as well.

The staff is cool, the Theatre is very clean and the sound is Amazing as well.

It was a fun experience and I will be back for sure!

This shopping mall is the reason why Caesars Palace is so big; it got over 270 mostly mid to luxury retailers, restaurant, and bars.  This mall been opened since 1992, that is over 20 years ago.  The interior design is been similar to Grand Canal Shoppes found in Venetian, but with ancient Rome style.  There is no canal here; instead, there is a large fountain and many Roman Gods.

This is a good mall to burn sometime when you waiting a long line in Bacchanal, their estimated time often in couple hours, you can easily spend that here and casino without even need to walk out the Caesar Palace.

Decent enough spot to grab breakfast or dinner. Lines can be long so if you don't mind grab a spot at the counter. Not a large menu and a bit pricey but consider it's casino prices.

Seems like a lot of so-so reviews for this spot. It's nothing fancy but an ok enough place to have breakfast while I was staying here the other week while attending a convention in town. Never had to wait on lines too long as I was by myself and always took a counter seat. Service up there was ok. 

Kind of tired looking decor though. MGM should renovate it a bit to have a more cheery look and not that of an old casino floor.

So they are not the sexiest macarons but what they lack in beauty they make up for in sheer macaron goodness!  The "cookies" exude freshness with their thin, crisp shell surrounding a just moist center.  The gentle caress of almond accentuates every flavor of not too sweet filling.  The nut flavors are outstanding but for $1 each, indulge in them all!

True Parisian style breads (great crust, great chew).  Tearing lustfully into a baguette with your bare hands, smelling it then enjoying its flavor with a glass of wine is hard to beat.

Outstanding croissants.  Flaky, not to buttery, with the perfect kiss of sweetness and saltiness.  Eating them naked is the only way to go. (You guys know what I mean - plain croissants).

Great looking shop.  Friendly and passionate service.  

If this small sampling is any indication, tout est bon!

We hired this company recently to unload a Broadway Express trailer on a very hot Sunday afternoon in July.  Thankfully, Conrad was happy to provide a crew for our move despite it being on a Sunday and despite us not knowing an exact start time.  Both Conrad and Jessie were great on the phone and were so kind and flexible with our situation.  When our crew arrived, we were thankful for their hard work and their desire to make sure we were satisfied.  Rene did a wonderful job and we really appreciated the hard work of the crew.

Slice window review!

Skip! ... end of review. The only time you should be here is if you're in too much of a rush to eat anywhere else. Due to the chewy dough, unremarkable sauce and the fact that they might have been sitting there all day, all of the slices are mediocre at best. Everything seems pretty low quality, maybe a slight step up from Domino's or Papa Johns. It seems like you can get some higher quality items inside, so maybe do yourself a favor and eat in there, but from what I've seen from the 3 slices I've rocked here, that might not be much better. 

Prices: $4 plain slice, $5 one topping, $5.75 specialty slices...bleh
Compare that to Pop Up Pizza who is serving 2 specialty slices and a soda for $7 and some change :/

Took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and WOW! I had the Vesuvio, which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little paddle full of goodness. Thankfully I chose the single scoop, because honestly it was so rich that I probably  would have gone in to an embarrassing moaning fest if there had been any more in my cup. Mom had the Light Mint Chip - a refreshing choice on such a hot summer day. Sister brazenly went for two scoops of Caffe Espresso paired with Chocolate.  Other than the much discussed PITA parking situation complements of LGO, there was not a single deterrent from the perfection of this experience.

Hey, I'm just looking out for ya. I have to say, AZ Iceman has saved my icey ass on more than one occassion. Usually the ice machine next to my office is so loud producing cubes I fear a major hail storm has moved in and nobody has alerted me. Lately. Not so much. She's a tempermental one, that ice machine. So a call to AZ Iceman yields an always polite employee who quickly dispatches the Iceman. Soon my cocktails, teas and sodas are fizzy, happy and cold once again. Like Liza Minelli on her wedding night. I don't know what kinda deal you would get, but I shelled out around $70 for 400 pounds of ice. Yes. You heard me. Four hundred pounds.

Within ten days, Hamilton, my now buddy at Progressive, came to my house and cut me two checks for damages to my car and damages to my back.

I am not buying into the hype. This place was dumpy with snotty airheaded old bartenders who will snub the shit out of you if you are a girl. She "forgot" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  

Video poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank. It isn't about $2.00 it's about the entitlement these idiots feel even when they provide below sub par service.

My ode to Estelle Getty:
Picture this. Scottsdale. Hotel Indigo pool. 
A middle aged gay man holding a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc runs to make a photo opp at Rickie's fashion show.
He didn't realize the three svelt female models with air bags for breasts were nude. Naked. Sin ropa! Nada lotta!
Except for their bikini-painted bodies. Yes. Body paint. 
By the pool. Me. Them. Slippery floor. Slippery glass of wine. 
As the photo is being snapped, I find myself losing my balance and I think, as I was going down with the wine, I should grab on to someone's clothing. To brace my fall. In front of hundreds. 
Well. They're nude. There is nothing to grab onto. Me and the wine go down spilling wine on all three of the models.
Causing their body paint to start streaking! SNAP goes the photo. 
Oh. Hotel Indigo? The services? Valet guy parked my car. Hostess greeted me. Bartender overserved me. The models hated me. 
Good times...

This place really is quite special. It's a natural tourist trap, so expect to see plenty of pasty, obnoxious Canadians and so forth, but from what I hear it is a sort of local landmark. 

I went for my birthday this year at the recommendation of a few work friends, and I had an incredible time. The pizza gets alot of flack, apparently, but I enjoyed it just fine. It's not likely to be mistaken for gourmet brick-oven pizza that snobs in Sedona eat, but it's still rather good from what I remember.

The organ was incredible. Gigantic. Played by a really good musician. The song selection is pretty universal, showtunes and the like, but just seeing the thing in action is remarkable. I highly recommend it. Now stop bashing the pizza!

Holy cow! This is NOT a "where's the beef?" burger! And, they are hand-formed, saw the guy molding patties with my own eyes!!

The greasy, heart-attack-in-a-bag $5 special is not for the faint hearted.

The green chile delivered the heat. Couldn't even finish my fries!

I WILL be back, but I'm definitely going to have to ration myself! Good thing it's not on my way home from work!!

It's what you'd expect in this corner of Charleston & Rampart. Homey atmosphere that gives you the feel of farm fresh to the table. Pretty decor that lets you know you are about to pay for it.
Ordered the much touted Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. It was ok. Battered chicken breast with an overly generous slather of honey mustard atop cole slaw. Served alongside a small salad of edamame, kale, cheese, carrots, radishes, seeds with a light vinaigrette. A glamorized chicken sandwich that I don't think is worth $13.00.
The Tuna tartare was good, but as my daughter says, "it's pretty hard to mess up tuna tartare". A small portion and overpriced at $15.00.
Service was ok. This place seems to cater to a typical pretentious Summerlin crowd. Overall, nothing special and not worth the $40 lunch bill for 2 for an app and fried chicken sandwich with one soda.
Ho hum, tried it and won't be back.

PS has been getting a lot of my lunchtime business lately.

Usually go for the sub, but on a whim, decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap, because essentially, its a sandwich, in a burrito.

I'd much rather be eating a "Sanrito", which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely, the "Burwich" makes me think of Burma, now called Myanmar, which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap.

Henry, oh Henry. 

Long line at the popular Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan hotel?
My friends decided to split up to order food at a couple places. Do you like how we multitask in getting crazy amounts of food?

2 bitter champagne cocktails + 1 spinach artichoke dip = $50+

Service was non-existent, yet rushed. The waitress kept asking if we were done with the menus when we did not even give her the order.

My friend had a to-go box from another restaurant, and they threw it away. When we asked about it, they defensively replied, "IT'S NOT OUR FAULT."

1 extra star because they open late and they let us eat our outside food (cosmo pizza) inside the restaurant.

I can only offer praises... yes, it can get busy, but it's worth the wait.  The spa pedicure has everything I could want... callous, sugar scrub, hot towel, and my personal fave... paraffin.

It's like that line from Karate Kid, "Get him a body bag!"... yes, I would love to fully immerse myself in that toasty elixir of softness... even m'lady parts.  It's like Snuggle for your epidermis... but alas, they'll only agree to wax your feet... which is good enough for now.

They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.

They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.

And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

Dillard's is a store that grows on you. 

First, their square footage is huge. At least twice as large as the nearby Macy's, maybe ever three times as large. What do you get for all that extra room? Choices. Lots and lots of choices.

For example, they don't just have one Ralph Lauren Polo shop, but two.  In the back near the escalator and men's colognes departments, they have another for XLT guys.  Being tall, I find their XLT shirt selection a godsend. Dillards also does a nice job with markdowns.  No matter when we come here, there is always something you can find in their "closeouts" section marked 35% off.  Nice!

Like my friend Marisa S, Dillards seems to have my number.

Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!

Very romantic atmosphere, lots of comfy furniture, and live music on weekends.

Sarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy, this was our last stop after a night of drinks. 

Would totally order the bottle, though. 

Their wine selection is pretty extensive, lots of $5/glass options, and I know within a certain timeframe, you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle. 

Full bar for all those that aren't wine lovers. 

Throw this one in your back pocket for date night, guys!

I was first introduced to Tomos in celebration of my brother and my girlfriend's birthday.  Since then, it's become my favorite sushi joint in the west valley!

Tomos keeps their restaurant dimly lit and there's plenty of bar space [sushi and alcohol] available.  I've only been here for dinner so I have yet experienced their lunch or Happy Hour special but I can't imagine those being anything less than delicious.  

For appetizers, their monkey balls, soft shell crab, the ninja jalapenos, and oyster shooters are delicious [warning:  raw quail egg].  Some of my favorite rolls are the Passion of Fire [pity they don't bring this lit on fire anymore], the Dysart Roll, Crunch Roll, Cowboy Roll, Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Popcorn Lobster.  The sashimi is always thickly cut and Ocean Salad is great too.

While Tomos isn't the absolute best place for sushi, if you're in the west valley, it's probably your safest bet for fresh sushi.

This class brings new meaning to Riding Giants. How awesome to be able to have an intense surf workout smack dab in the middle of the desert?! It's tight, dude.

At first you will feel completely uncoordinated, but not to worry, so does everybody else. You have to get familiar with the board and the rhythm of the board. When I say rhythm I mean the shakiness. The board shakes and it is your core's duty to control it. I fell on my arse in front of the class within the first ten minutes, but it's all good. Once you get the hang of it this class is a blast!

We did squats, push-ups, down dog and jump up on the board like you are actually catching a wave. It would be hard to not have fun in this class. 

They offer several different class options. One with resistance bands, a cardio one, and a combination of both. They offer single sessions, a package of sessions, monthly unlimited and annual unlimited. You can also have private sessions if you wish so then you look like a Surf Pimp in the class and show us all up. 

Overall I am super stoked about this gym and the Instructors. It may not be the O.P. Open and Kelly Slater may not be dripping his sweet ocean water sweat juice on me, but I am still all over Surfset!

Got tickets from Tix4tonight for tickets on the same day of the show... they seat you based on 1st come 1st served unless you upgraded & paid more $$ to be in the VIP sections.

Had so much fun here, the show is kinda cheesy but it's all clean fun with HOT HOT guys! =)

The guys here are HOT HOT HOT!! =) +1

I like the way the stage is setup here..not only is it the front stage but there's a part of the stage where they can walk out into the audience more. +1

The guys interacted with the audience a LOT LOT more than at Chippendale. +1

If you want to sit closer to the stage or in the middle of the seating area, you have to pay more for those seats. =(

The main guys knew how to dance but the ones at the end of the line were just there for eye candy; that's just fine with me.. =) +1

Great for bachelorette parties/ just girlie get togethers =)

A Geno's cheese steak.  A pastrami from Katz Deli.  A French dip from Philippe's.  A brisket and tongue from Carnegie Deli.  A godmother from Bay Cities Italian Deli.  A "Fluff and Nutt" from the Goodwich.  

Unfair compression?  If you're going to charge me $3.00 for something I can make at home for $0.50 or claim to serve foie de pate for only $9.00 you better be able to compete with the big boys.

A great concept, chef inspired twist on the classics but in the end, these are greasy, unhealthy, bizarre sandwiches.

- PBB&J (peanut butter, bacon, pepper jelly and rosemary).  Bizarre but it works.  Peanut butter and bacon, a match made in heaven is complemented by the herbaceous aroma of the rosemary.

- "Ruben-ish" (corned beef, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, fennel kraut) A paltry amount of somewhat dry, corned beef that initially pairs well with the anise flavor of the kraut.  The kraut quickly becomes overpowering with each bite.

- "Foie &" (Foie pate, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds)  Chicken skin is excellent while the sauted cabbage adds vegetal sweetness and almonds, crunch.  I doubt their claim that they are using pate de foie gras.  French law mandates the pate be made of 80 percent foie.  The mouth feel is off and the mineral flavor leads me to think this is chicken liver pate.

Supermarket quality white, wheat or rye breads.  All becoming dry from toasting.  Making them "Monte Cristo" (a dip in egg before being griddled) just makes them more greasy and less appetizing.

Excessive Yelp hype aside, in the end, just an average sandwich.

What's not to love about the Fountains of Bellagio? It's free. It's beautiful. It's captivating. It's the only thing in Vegas that never seems to get old for me. The entertainment from the combination of dancing water, lights, and music is mesmerizing. With 30 plus songs, hearing seeing the same performance is few and far between which helps make the Fountains one of the most dynamic entertainment options in Las Vegas.

The schedule varies by day, but basically they occur every 30 minutes during the afternoon and early evening and then from 6:00, 7:00, or 8:00 (depending on the day) every 15 minutes until midnight. My recommendation is to visit the fountains  at least three times. See power of the water in the daytime. See the beauty of the Bellagio, sky, and lake at sunset. See the majesty and mystery of the lights and water at night.

The variety of songs range from classical to pop. You'll find Faith Hill's kitchy "This Kiss" or the Sin City anthem of Elvis belting "Viva Las Vegas" just as likely as you are to hear Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli's inspirational "Time to Say Goodbye." The water is choreographed in complex patterns from 4 different types of water fountains that spray water in spherical motions or shoot water straight upwards. The tall blasts of 240 or 460 feet in the air are true crowd pleasers while the smaller jets appear to be truly dancing to the music.

It all takes place in the 8-acre lake directly in front of the Bellagio. The firm WET Design was the mastermind behind the $40 million water show that features more than 1,200 spouts and 4,500 lights. Kudos to them and the Bellagio. 

The Fountains of Bellagio stand out in a city full of temptations and entertainment as a simple, timeless, and beautiful way to spend a few minutes letting your heart and spirit be a kid again.

What an amazing convention center!!!!

PERKS
+ Ample parking
+ Bus routes available for those attending the convention center
+ Taxis and limos available outside as well
+ Friendly employees to assist you to the right direction
+ Bathrooms are kept clean!

DIRTS
- Overpriced food at the food-court
- Need more seating area for those hanging around the convention center
- Be prepared for lots of walking! (Bring comfy shoes!)
- Taxi and limo drivers can be kinda reckless!

FYI =
* Nearby hotels: You can stay either at Excalibur, Luxor or Mandalay Bay
* Tram from Excalibur & Luxor connects to Mandalay Bay so you can just walk towards the convention center (~10-15 minutes travel time)
* Wedding chapel and Shark reef attraction is in the same area as the convention center
* Border Grill is walking distance towards the casino if you're looking for a better bite to eat than at the food court!

This place is a joke. A plastic surgeon that values his practice would never rent a room in a beauty salon just to peddle junk services. I bought a groupon but couldnt get an appt for 2 months out. Then the appts i had set 2 months prior were cancelled a week before because their machine (yes one) broke down. When i finally got an appt I was nothing but dissapointed. Their "center" is a small room in the back of beauty salon and  the machine was so outdated it gave no results and nothing but discomfort. Then they canceled another appointment last minute because the facility had plumbing issues and no running water. I mean really!!! I would give this place negative stars if I could. Real waste of money.

When my adventurous hiking friend told me this hike was very difficult, I was expecting the worst but I guess since I've spent so much time running daily, I guess my endurance has improved and I really didn't think the hike was that difficult. It's not covered with "stairs" like Piestewa Peak, and it is much longer, but man! Was this hike gorgeous! Even the drive in was unique. It was similar to being on a small roller coaster, hilly as can be!

This hike, at least the 5 mile one we did today, promises tighter butt and quad muscles! You gain an elevation of about 1,200 feet, the trail guide at the entrance said. There are plenty of switchbacks and areas where the gravel is loose but the scenery is so breath taking that you are distracted and almost don't even think about the hike's difficulty.

There is no water around as other hikers have mentioned, so please bring water with you just in case when you hike. This trail is definitely worth trying at least once and who knows? You might become addicted to always coming here, because I know I will!

Le Reve translates to "The Dream", the titular setting of the show, a trippy dreamworld of falling rains inhabited by fallen angels, a whimsical Pan, and a shaman of sorts.

Encore Theatre's circular layout ensures a view no matter where you sit, and the central stage converts into a pool, filling with water for thematic effects. Haunting melodies, swooping acrobatics, and even synchronized swimmers make up Le Reve. Strange-but-charming humor punctuate acts, and there's a bit of sexy ballroom dancing. (My only gripe was the amount of tumbling work, which grew repetitive.)

Those who loved Cirque du Soleil's "O" (especially the aerial stunts) may want to skip the show. However, Franco Dragone's Le Reve has dance routines, music, and water effects that can stand on their own; I can comfortably recommend this show, especially to those seeking a slower-paced evening.

I'm moving in. The end. This is the most authentic shop (of any variety) that I've seen since I moved to Arizona. It reminds me of the mercados I used to hit up in VA in that it has everything, hookahs to religious art, and of course food. 

The bakery was a mystery to me. I pointed at a few things, have since tried two of them, and I have no idea what they are. But I like them. There is a huge section devoted to turkish delights, as I sadly found out after making my purchases. Great cheeses! Massive quantities of dried fruits, nuts, olives and canned meats.

If I win the lottery or somehow encounter a huge sum of money, I will become a member of Silverleaf... that is, if I am invited.

The Silverleaf Club is by far, the most beautiful country club I've ever stepped into... I didn't see the entire golf course, but I am sure it is amazing - here are the stats and description: 18-hole, par-72, 7,299-yard course designed by PGA champion and golf course architect Tom Weiskopf.The Silverleaf golf course winds through secluded canyons and valleys of the McDowell Mountains,providing dramatic elevation changes and city views. 

The Silverleaf Club and Spa (unfortunately, I didn't even get to see the Spa part) is exclusive and membership is by invitation only, it's tied to property ownership, and there are two membership levels - full golf and social.

I attended a wedding at The Silverleaf Club this past Saturday night and it was incredibly beautiful.  The ceremony took place at sunset and the colors in the sky combined with the green golf course and red mountains were breathtaking.  There was a tad bit of rain before and after the ceremony and during the middle, we witnessed a rainbow!  

The cocktail reception was held outdoors with a full bar and passed appetizers, and then we went inside for dinner and the party - it was a dream and I couldn't be happier for my friends that are now husband and wife.  The Silverleaf Club provided a true fairytale evening that I know I will never forget... and it wasn't even my wedding!

Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern American charm, in your name doesn't mean you can't provide modern services like clean restrooms? Perhaps you could sweep the floor. And wipe down the counter. Oh, I know, maybe the pigeon poo could be scraped off the tables. I know. I know. I'm asking so much. And you'd think with a sort of Southern American name, you'd have that Blanche Deveroe, drawl and all, southern service, friendly and warm, like a peach cobbler on an autumn afternoon. Sadly, no.

Although the coffee station was messier than the Circle K near the airport. It looked as a group of overly caffenited monkeys had just used it. And the croissant. Was like a pastry boomerang.

Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.

Sometimes you sit around and hate on hipsters because they drink 'silly, overpriced cocktails'. Well, sometimes hipsters drink those 'silly, overpriced cocktails' and are happy that you stayed at home. Such is the case at Velveteen Rabbit. If this 'hipster haven' keeps serving up well-crafted cocktails (at a decent $8 price), interesting craft brews and rockin' good tunes, consider me a hipster, because I'm going to be a regular here. The furniture, exposed brick and Edison bulbs add a nice vibe to the place and the crowd (even on a Friday at 1am) isn't overbearing. Sick of a rum and coke?

Never in my Yelp career have I started, saved, deleted and restarted a review more than I have this Bashas review. One would think "This is just a grocery store, why all the trouble?"

Bashas is more than just a grocery store; it is a facilitator. A facilitator of what we need as consumers to fuel our lives and contribute to our happy memories or to help us wash away the bad ones. 

Bashas facilitated the best Champagne Sunday that ever existed. It has provided the chlorine that I so desperately needed so many times to keep my pool from going green. Here I found the curry paste that started my affinity for cooking. The cake that ended up all over my living room at my sister's 21st birthday? That's right: Bashas.

So many events and critical moments in our lives revolve around the tangible items we spend our hard earned cash on and we don't even realize it. We may complain about how long we have to stand in line or the fact that Bashas may be a tad more expensive than some other grocery stores, but we cannot deny that we need this Bashas. 

I need you, Bashas.

And I'm surrounded.

When I see biscuits and gravy on a menu, I am already in love. Also, they don't have it on the menu, but try the chorizo gravy on your biscuits. We only knew about it because Joe himself came to our table. In face, he visited a lot of patrons while we were there.
The potatoes weren't anything fancy, but man oh man, that omelet was amazing. I am still thinking about it!

"Oh Johnnie's you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my ....weenie?" OK so it doesn't rhyme, but Mr. Chang, owner of Johnnie's is a force to be reckoned with. He smiles. He greets. Takes your order. Makes the food. And is obviously passionate about what he does. He even has homemade chocolate cake for less than $2 a slice! But it's about the Chicago dog for me. Neon green relish. Pickle. Tomato. Celery salt. Mustard. Onions. On a steamed poppy seed bun...which I'm sure will cause me to test poz for opiates. For less than $4 you get your weenie and some delish fries! I'm so glad I went back and can't wait to have a Chicago dog made by an Asian man in the desert!

Forget the fireman.
Forget the cop.
Forget the business man.

All I want all night every night is the MILK MAN!! 

No joke... the milk man was HOT! And it wasn't the bangin' body I was digging, it was his smile (*wink, wink*).

I've been to a few male reviews in Vegas and I'd have to say this one is my favorite so far. The guys are super cute and pretty personal! Plus they're all really from down under and have the cute accent! 

Highlights for me included:
* The bar with really stiff drinks and drink specials! 
* The milk man
* The Birthday Girl (my friend) going up on stage
* The milk man
* The group pictures where we made them do asian poses! 
and of course
* The milk man!

If there's one thing I despise more than nightclubs, it's dayclubs!! Masses of silicone-enhanced, orange-skinned, nappy-extensioned party whores clad in little more than sweat and pheromones, plus their 'roided-out, tribal-tatted mook boyfriends/pimps/codependents, guzzling syrupy blended drinks and pumping their fists to some Eurotrash house music DJ. Blah!

But I do enjoy topless sunbathing -- and sadly, all the topless pools have become dayclubs. I used to really like the Venus pool at Caesars -- quiet, secluded, and no kids allowed because of all the shameful titty on display. Then the douchers from PURE nightclub took over, and now the music is so loud it causes the implants of all the whores in attendance to pulsate.

TAO Beach is slightly less annoying than Venus, with one notably asinine exception: "European-style" sunbathing (i.e. topless) is allowed, but when going in the actual water one must put a top on. The ALLEGED reason for this policy? A health code stipulation, meant to prevent women from inadvertently lactating in the water.

REALLY? Like the water in those dayclub pools isn't already a  bacterial soup of sweat, precum, vaginal secretions and inadvertently-leaked amniotic fluid and endometrium -- you mean to tell me that a bikini top is going to prevent anything else from being added to that foul brew?! The water at these dayclubs is already so thick with DNA that I once saw a new life form emerge from the primordial soup at ReHab -- Homo Douchiens.

For this reason alone, my advice is to skip TAO Beach altogether. Moorea (at Mandalay Bay) and Bare (Mirage) are better alternatives that allow you to actually swim topless. 

Not that I plan on getting pregnant...but if I ever DO, I'm going straight over to TAO Beach and squirting milk all over the pool deck. On behalf of all women who have ever been unwillingly jizzed upon, I will bestow 
a Revenge Pearl Necklace in your honor!

UPDATE! 7.18.11
I came back a few days later, on a Monday, and they were letting women go topless in the water! I guess the guy who told me the lactating story was full of sh*t...I guess they just have some weird weekend rules on Thurs-Sun that prohibit topless swimming, but it's fine the rest of the week. Whatevs!

YES! I finally got to experience this fabulous show. Being as the Beatles remain my all time favorite band I have been wanting to see this show forever. And i was not disappointed. We had seats in the front row but up on a ledge. I personally think this could have been the best seats in the house. The portray  of the Beatles era was spot on. The dancers were very talented. My favorite set had to be to the song Strawberry Fields Forever. The entire room went red and they had an array of various performers blowing all different types of bubbles. it was visually arousing. There was also an awesome guest interaction they put a huge white sheet over the crowd and pastel colors shown through. I highly recommend seeing this show. Especially if your a Beatles fan.

Ever had a piece of Broccoli that made you re-evaluate the vegetable entirely? Well I did, and I bought it from Phx Pub Mrkt. Beautiful verdant luscious dark green colour, crunchy savory and earthy, it even kept in my fridge far longer than I'd have figured an organic piece of Broccoli bought in an open air market should've kept. This broccoli made me a believer in this place. Nowadays I only shop for my seasonal fruits and veggies here, and the fact it's within walking distance from my shack only gives me further incentive. The market itself is not too big, they offer some hippie entrees at a lunch counter made by kids with tattoos and piercings and humble courteous faces. The veggies, fruits, and most of the merchanise is eihter a.)local b.)organic c.) expensive or d.)all of the above. However I love everything this market stands for and is trying to accomplish, I can only sing it's praises and shell money at it, hoping it grows into the little shop of horrors it was meant to be- with giant 7 foot anthropomorphized campy Little Richard like broccoli heads with a taste for blood and musicals.

Customer service...customer service...customer service...excellent customer service!  Note to management, Heather(redhead) is a retail Rockstar!

Either you like the Apple Store or you don't!  All I can say is I am a customer for life!  What other electronics manufacturer sets the trend for their peers to emulate?  A couple competitors have copied the retail model, but many more attempt to duplicate their products. 

When it was time to upgrade to my iPhone 6 pIus I was not sure if I wanted the 6 or 6 plus.  I went into the store two times in a weekend trying to decide which model to get.  In both occasions Heather was there to offer me very informative information on the phone and my carrier.  I was also on the fence on going with another two year traditional contract or the new rage of no contract.  I can't say enough on how helpful the Apple Store made my indecisiveness into a laser focus decision for my family and I. 

The Apple Store is also world-class for training and service.  Their classes are very informative and the best part...they are free!  If you happen to have any issues caused by user error or a manufacturing defect, they will send you home happy and content!  My last iPhone 5 was 2 years old and out of contract.  Apple established they had a bad batch batteries in the iPhone 5's.  They went out of their way and recalled these phones and gave me a new replacement battery at no cost.  The service was done in store and no need for my phone to be sent out to some out of state facility and being out of a phone for weeks at a time.

BESTEST CREPES. ME LIKEY.

I've experienced quite a few...multiple times...
These guys have mastered the Art of Crepe. Yes. It's a thing. 
Spot-on thickness. Splendid texture, akin to the dense-quality of a good pancake, yet not so doughy. Plus they've got an oh-so-delicate sweetness that allows for versatility as far as making these beauties sweet or savory.  



*Dark chocolate, caramel, sea salt crepe - FAN-frickin-TASTIC. My most-ordered crepe from here. The one that I dream about at night. I no lie. 

*Pumpkin mascarpone pecan crepe - SEASONAL, sigh. 

*Lemon curd and whipped cream crepe - in the words of my dear, econ-majoring friend: "THE TANGENCY!" (for the mathaphobes out there - this is code for: she loved it)

*Apples and caramel and pecan crepe - one of their greatest. (certainly on par with the dark chocolate one I crave every waking moment of my life) the sugary deliciousness of the caramel...with the sweet crunch from the apples and the indulgent flavor of the pecans - love.

*Smoked prosciutto spinach parmesan scrambled - this is the one savory crepe I've dabbled into, though this was my friend's order so I only took a few bites. Tasty nonetheless. 



As far as beverages: I've had their peppermint tea. Check mate. And their chai latte can't be beat. The Art of Crepe carries over to the Art of Latte/latte art - they've got this down man. Delicious AND beautiful bevvies. 

Basically, I love you Bradbury. One of my favorite spots - to study/chill/gastronomically indulge - in Madison.

Awful service. Disrespectful staff. My husband ordered a beer from a waitress, gave her 100. Never came back with beer or change. When my husband, a combat veteran, complained he was grabbed by "security" and told to leave. 

I spoke to manager for several minutes who told me there was nothing he could do. It was the waitress' word against my husband's. So yes let's take a stripper's word over a combat veteran who fought and served our country. 

My sister was charged twice for one lap dance. 

Another friend was told he wouldn't get his ID or Visa back until he signed the check which included 240 worth of bullshit charges. 

I didn't expect much but I was seriously shocked at how shady and underhanded everyone was. 

Two thumbs way way down.

I've been hearing about Tee Pee for years; it's considered a Phoenix landmark, I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.  

My quick summary:
*chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest
*guacamole - nasty
*Bud Light - A-OK
*Chicken Tostada - decent
*House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato)
*Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!

Bottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere.

Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.
They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. 
Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.
I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.

Jabbawockeez joins forces with Super Crew (who were throwin' up that tell-tale 'S' with their hands) in an explosive, high energy show. 

I wasn't an avid watcher of ABDC (unlike the screaming fans behind us) but I'd seen it enough times to know I was in for an evening of breaking, poppin' & lockin.' The show turned out to be so much more; audience participation that was really funny (& sometimes quite sexy), a storyline about what a janitor dreams is possible & a diverse soundtrack for the masked dancers to showcase their talent to. 

There is a glow-in-the-dark sequence that is especially memorable; a skit that pays homage to ninjas & martial artists from another era. The dancers put their spin on everyone from NKOTB to queen to beyonce (hilarious!)

The show actually starts when you are in line to enter the Monte Carlo theater, so get there a little early. We got tickets at the tix4tonight booth--about $49 a person, 3rd row. If you are tired of paying Cirque prices & want to see a show that's more upbeat, Mus.i.c is a fantastic alternative. Hell yea, five stars for an entertaining evening! Show is about 2 hours without intermission.

Candy Coated Recipe 

Sugar Factory, please add...

*3 large sized "Cross-Trained" Employees
*2 happy Attitude Adjustments 
*1 medium sized Refrigerated Display Case

To your already...

*Delicious selection of candies, baked goods, & cold treats  
*Bright & colorful establishment

Yes, there was only one person helping with order taking and making of the labor intensive products they have on the menu even though there were 4 people. I guess no one can help that person out. In addition to the velvet brownie & chocolate milkshake, we ordered 4 macarons that were $1.50 a pop for the half-dollar sized yum-yums. Unfortunately, they aren't kept cool in a refrigerated section so they just get hard and downright nasty sitting there. The girl behind the counter said they make them fresh everyday and that they were popular. It's a shame I paid 6 bucks for nasty wafer like cookies. I could have bought myself 2 boxes of OREOS with that money. The only thing going for this over-priced place is the Couture Pops! Sure their pricey but it's all about being seen with those bling-blingin' trendy lollipops. I bought one with a box of refills ($40).

I'd like to personally shake Mr Tofu's hand.  While I cannot medically prove it, I am 100% certain that their soondubu contains undefined healing properties.  Some how some way, I always feel better after a meal here.  

Got a cold?  Screw the Nyquil and get the spicy kimchi soondubu.

Bad day at work?  Beef soondubu=good f'n day

Broken leg?  Just splash a little pork soondubu broth on your leg and it'll probably heal instantly.  

Venereal disease?  Wait a couple of minutes before pouring it all over your crotch since it comes out piping hot.  Don't want to scare the other customers with your screaming.  Perhaps the seafood soondubu would be best for this.    

At $8 a bowl, even my wallet feels better!

The lunch specials are great here! I had the "Pineapple Chicken" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The "Egg Drop Soup" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free "Egg Rolls" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. 

I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some "Fried Wontons" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!

They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm.

I'm a beach babe at heart and this is the closest I can get in Arizona without planning a longer journey. The lake is very calm. I like to hang out at Butcher Jones Recreation Area because it has a large beach and the water is shallow, good for hanging out with friends or family. We brought our dog last time, which I guess you're not supposed to do, but I kept him on the leash and there were no problems. 

FYI- No campfires in the summertime! Bring a grill or sandwiches. :0) Also if you plan on drinking, make sure one person stays sober. There will be cops looking for you on the way out. Going to the lake and getting a DUI would definitely ruin a day at the lake.

If you're going to watch one Cirque show in Vegas, make it this one!

Trust, it's one of the best Cirque shows i've ever seen on the strip!

From the breathtaking panoramic scenes, amazing set changes, and jaw dropping acrobatic performances, this show is a MUST for any Vegas goer.

The water element was what took this show over the top for me.  Much like Le Reve (not a Cirque Du Soleil affiliated show) it was incredible seeing how the set dynamically changed from dry to wet and even wetter!

Just do yourself a favor and do not, i repeat Do NOT purchase tickets for the front rows. You'll eventually end up breaking your neck trying to see all the aerial performances! For me, the sweet spot for any Cirque Du Soleil show is middle and center. You're able to see everything comfortably from this vantage point and that IMO is priceless!

With the combination of the inspiring live soundtrack, exotic sets and spectacular performances, i can guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience that you will treasure for years to come!

Happy Times!

Sure, you kids have got your Rain and your Pure and your Snoopy Dog parties, but in keeping with my old lady name, I prefer some of the simple elderly pleasures in life...like bingo. Okay, so maybe I went to keep my mom entertained for a couple of hours...and maybe I've accompanied my mom on many a bingo excursion before, but this was the first to Gold Coast's bingo hall...and I'm more than a fan. 

Picture this hypothetical scenario: you've already withdrawn your $300 for the day, the blackjack tables haven't treated you so well, and you're in dire need of a drink. Hypothetically, of course. Well, for a mere $10 you get unlimited booze (you don't even have to wait for the cocktail gal, you can get your free booze directly from the bar) and the chance to annoy old folks and win a few hundred bucks. 

Sadly, the bad luck wasn't shaken by an afternoon bingo session, but five vodka tonics later...I left there one happy bingo-er.

Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. 

I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. 

Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. 

I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea". 

There.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

"We don't fit in" says my poker bud.

"What are you talking about" I say.

"Look around, everyone in here is Asian" he whispers.

"And what are we?" I answer dumbfounded.

"No, I mean they are like Wong Fu Asian.  You know, guys in skinny jeans carrying around stuffed animals for girls who weigh 90 pounds or less and take pics with whisker fingers" he continues.

Laughing uncontrollably "Shut up and eat your menu".

Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.

Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.

Standout examples:

Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.

Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.  

Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.

And yes, the menu was delicious.

Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:

- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership
- Build an organic  farm in my backyard
- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables
- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes
- Get a restaurant business license
- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property
- Grow a full, luxurious beard

I had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. 

Instead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! 

I do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.

Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop.

I finally had the chance to have a piece of cake from Barb's Bakery and although the five pounds I gained from the cake hate me, my sweet tooth thanks me for finding yet another fabulous Phoenix bakery! Holy moly. If you are a fan of cake and cake that's soft, moist, sweet, creamy and perfect all in one bite, this is your spot. 

Barb's is an adorable bakery with a storefront full of everything from cupcakes and pastries to donuts and cookies. But it's her cake that gets her the five stars in my book. My youngest nephew (2 months) just celebrated his baptism and so of course that called for a celebration. I told my sister about Barb's so she grabbed the cake from there and brought it to the party. I could have started and ended with just the cake it was so good. 

The cake was the perfect size for our group and they did a wonderful job of decorating it in honor of the baptism with white and blue frosting, his name, date and blue crosses. It was a three layer chocolate with vanilla frosting cake. I originally asked for a sliver but when I saw how delicious it looked, I opted for a normal size piece instead. Is it bad that I consumed every last crumb in under five minutes? I don't think so at all. I would do it again in a heartbeat! 

So with that, I'm officially adding Barb's Bakery to my list of sweet spots.

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

Tam and Kevin were in Las Vegas celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary.  We wanted to send them flowers.  I went to Yelp and found English Garden Florist.  I looked at their website and fell in love w/ a simple, elegant Ikebana-like arrangement of oncidium and dendrobium orchids, torch ginger, anthuriums and greenery.  I called and spoke w/ a man who was both patient and thorough, taking all the information and double checking it.  He explained that the flowers would be delivered to the concierge desk, as they are not allowed to deliver to hotel rooms directly.

Tam posted a photo of the arrangement on Facebook and while it wasn't identical to the one on the website, it was equally stunning.  https://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/RGu8qTTeJi9ycafgMFTIXQ/l.jpg  They just returned home and when she called just now to let us know, she told me how tall and gorgeous the arrangement was and how she regretted having to leave it there, but that they would have had to have bought another seat to bring it home.  Happily they were able to enjoy it from Friday to today, Tuesday.  We were thrilled to have such good service at long distance.

Last year, Subway introduced their FebruANY. Any regular FOOTLONG is $5.00 during February. Get it?

Well we came here two days ago for lunch.  We had a newspaper coupon, and ended up spending just over $10.00 for two meals, drinks and one bag of chips.  Nice!  The restaurant is tucked away in the Gold's Gym strip mall and surprisingly gets good traffic.  

There was about six other patrons there when we arrive.  We were greeted by two employees as we entered. They put our order together pretty quickly without error.  The efficiency at Subway is good to begin with.  We ordered the Veggie Delite and a Roast Beef.  Both were very fresh and tasty, see photos.

An interesting sidebar, the franchise owner had a framed photo of himself and Jared Fogle.  You can read more about his fear of flying: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/business/jared-fogle-subway-guy-on-being-recognized-in-airports.html?_r=0

Want to know how to wake this Diva Goddess up early on a Saturday morning? Tell her there's a Farmer's Market that sells delicious and fresh food! DING! I had the pleasure of visiting the OTFM with Mr. Hottie and my favorite Foodie Bear and what an adventure it was!! I won't write too terribly much about it, because how many reviews can you read about fresh produce and freshly baked goods? A highlight of my visit was the fresh mozzarella I bought from the Digestif booth. I watched it get freshly formed and was educated about where their ingredients come from. It was SO yummy! I also visited the Sweet Republic bus, and the McLendon Farms operation. WOW! I also got to meet a few fellow yelpers and share some yummy bread from their quest for fresh goods. I will certainly return to OTFM! (I heard a rumor that they will be moving the market into the underground parking area for the summer time) It was such a pleasure eating a meal made from the fresh ingredients purchased from local vendors!

Met a couple of colleagues for lunch the other day and saw @Matt S review that mentioned a Pastrami Melt....so I went for it with Fries.  I wasn't paying, so I didn't get the price....I think it was around $7.95.

The Sandwich came out pretty fast.  It tasted pretty good, but the Bread was greasy!  I understand it's a melt, so it should be kind of like a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.....but it was much more oily than that.  The Fries were excellent and the service was very good as usual.

This place gets packed for lunch, especially during the weekdays, so get there before Noon if you don't want to wait.

Waited in a long line of people.   This line moves one foot every ten minutes and I'm so hungry.
   Service wasn't up to par.
   Oooh my gosh!  All these people passing up our long line have silver cards. 
    These big spenders just fly right in, escorted by a manager.  Then after I git to the register, I find out I coulda went ta the front of the line too. I had a gold card.  
    Escorts / hostess look for empty tables for us    Plate of Shrimp, a plate of prime rib, a plate of dried up lamb, off I go to pig out. 

    Our left over dishes were piled high on the table..    Overall....food is average.  
    They need more cash register booths, so the lines move quicker.  .

Most delicious Cupcakes I've had in the state of Arizona!!! An amazing morning bun too!!
It's all organic and an ever so fresh delight!! Not only cupcakes, they also offer cookies, morning buns and cakes plus more!
On top of that, they were winners on Cupcake Wars, how legit is that??!! 
Truly legit,  that's right!!! 
Another wonderful insight on this bake shop is that their incredibly community driven by supporting local charities, they support local organizations and are family owned and for the most part family operated too!! 
    Amazing!! Not too many of those around!! But truly try for yourself, this place is so amazingly great and delicious!! Forget about any sort of diet and indulge yourself on a cupcake or an ever so great morning bun!! YUM!!!! 
You will never regret it!! Thank me later :)

If you look at the Las Vegas Strip as entertainment and not a place to strike it rich, then you should have a nice time here.

I've been here a couple of times over the years, with nothing particular in mind.  It's has the draw of the old Times Square has for me.  A little bit of an adrenaline rush with amusement park like sights and sounds.  

We've been here mostly when it's been cool and comfortable, so walking is always been enjoyable.  To catch the full Las Vegas experience, I would recommend: New York, New York;  MGM Grand; Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, The Mirage, Caesar's and Steve Wynn's place at the upper end of The Strip. 

For what it's worth, I've never been a fan of Circus Circus  If you have time, try the monorail if it's working.  At the other end, the Freemont ceiling is a must!

Enjoy

The Cycle Pub Crawl took us here as one of the stops but we wish they hadn't. For a chain restaurant, their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub, but not a crappy chain restaurant.
We all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave.
A very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby.

WORST CLUB EVER. I love electronic music and this venue has great DJ's but a horrible sound system. The system could not handle the low or high end that is required for electronic music. If you are not getting a table do not go here. I had  FOUR drinks spilled on me and my drink spilled twice. I paid $30 for my ticket and $50 for my husbands during the presale to see Tiesto on March 15, 2014. They over packed the club. If i called the fire marshal they would have shut the club down. If there was a fire everyone would have died. I did not even stay to see Tiesto due to the overcrowding and lack of view. The wait at the bar was not even worth it for a watered down drink....just to be spilled. 

I WOULD NEVER GO HERE AGAIN AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLUB TO ANYONE.

Hmm.  I got a private response from Sally M. at Desert Roots. Here it is:

Judgey 
"I found your review very judgmental. Do you mind when your server who serves you meats or alcohol offensive if they smoke? Cigarettes, although not the healthiest thing on the planet, are not made from dead animals, or GMOs.
Eating a vegan diet, for some, has more to do with a cruelty-free way of living, rather than a health choice." - Sally M.

Dear Sally M., 
The issue is not that I am judging you for smoking.  I assure you I do not care one lick of an iota if you smoke.  It's that you smoked right outside your restaurant, then waltzed back in and immediately went to serve up some hummus.  My issue is that this is unsanitary, and whether you're serving a veggie wrap or a ribeye smothered in extra GMO meat sauce, just plain gross.

My Brother-In-Law gets credit for introducing me to this place.  This is a gold mine for slightly defected (scratched or chipped) furniture and appliances.  It's where the returns from their regular retail store end up.  It's tucked away in the warehouse district of North Las Vegas, just off the I-15 freeway.

My BIL bought a dining room set and a sofa & love seat here.  The prices are ridiculously low!  If you can live with the fact that it's brand new but with minor defects, then this is the place for you.  Some of the defects were minor and barely detectable.....nothing a little varnish or patchwork can't fix.  To save literally 100's or 1000's of dollars, it's worth it.  Most of the prices are 50-75% Off the retail price.

I wish I knew about this place 3 yrs ago when we blew our wad on brand new furniture.

**TIPS** 

- Be prepared to pick up the items yourself.  Delivery is NOT included with your purchase.

- Everything is sold "As Is", no refunds.  So be sure to check your items BEFORE you leave.

Overall, it's a great place to find awesome furniture deals.

Flour. Sugar. Butter. Egg.

Big.

Friggin.

Whoop.

Didn't go in, but they were delivered to my office.

Had two flavors - both were okay, but so sugary that they tasted pretty much the same.  Frosting tasted distinct at least, and was decent frosting, but there was actually too much of it piled up there.  (I hear an elderly Jewish man in the background of my review right now, saying in a most stereotypical Jackie Mason voice, "I should have such problems.")

I guess this is a clear example of an establishment setting a higher standard for itself with their pricing point, presentation, and marketing, and then not being able to live up to that standard.  

A $0.50 cupcake from a girlscout bakesale may not have the prestige or cachet, but I'd bet that the girl or her mom at least stirred the batter properly before putting it in the little cups.  

One of my cupcakes had the unstirred situation happening -- where one bite was flour-y, the next almost tasted baking soda-y for some reason.  

Inexcusable.

There is a sliding scale for judging those places that charge premium prices.  That means this cupcake gets a 2 star rating, while the bakesale homejob from the box would get 4 stars.  

Because it's not trying to be something it's not.

Flour. Sugar. Butter. Egg.

Take that, lemmings.  Bourgeois be B&.

This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.

Amex's Centurion lounge gets 5 stars not only for being very accommodating during my  6 hour delay, but for being one of the finest domestic airport lounges I've had the pleasure to enjoy in awhile. 

From a computer fax station, full bar with premium beer, spirits and wine,  gourmet buffet including Scott Conant of Scarpetta fame's fine cuisine, coffee and refreshments,  to multiple spacious lounge areas with cushy loveseats, private lounge pods with charging stations, kids play zone, chaise lounges looking out into the Tarmac and more, this lounge is pretty much has it all. I know ill most likely be frequenting this one as opposed to the smaller Club VIP Lounge located in the same terminal. Additionally, I'm allowed up to two guests as opposed to a 25$ charge for additional guests at the other lounges. 

It's one of the great perks you get being a valued Amex card member.

After a long hike, my group of 6 was starving and I decided that we should check out the Cornish Pasty Co, in Mesa. We ordered a variety of pasties: the Royale w/ cheese, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Alfredo and the Reuben.

Now, you may wonder...what the HELL is a pasty? First of all, it's pronounced 'pass-tee', which is a meat pie. Not to be mistaken for 'pace-tee', used to describes a person's pale complexion or those nipplage stickers burlesques dancers use. 

It's the British version of a Spanish empanada. And, IT IS HUGE!! I like huge....food... ;o)

I ended up ordering the Shepherd's Pie. The flaky shell crust hides the meat and potatoes, on the inside.  The meat was well seasoned, super yummy and blended well, with the mashed potatoes. I was craving for more, after my first bite. Actually, it was so good, I can still imagine the taste of the pasty, in my mouth. Hello, drool!

A single pasty will cost you about $8. It's enough to fill up a single adult. We didn't get sides, this time around.  But, we will next time.  And, oh yes, there WILL be a next time!!

The church pews are a nice touch.  The service super friendly and helpful.  I got no complaints and I will come here, again. Oh, why don't we have one like this in San Diego?!? Why? Why? WHY?!?

Until the next time Cornish Pasty Company..... *le sigh*

Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. 

We decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent.

One of the most unique steakhouses in Vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  MONTHS aged dry aged beef.

Read on, I promise not to talk about what the process really is.

Called "Riserva", the once USDA prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  The result is unlike "younger", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  The shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  The months aged beef, think prosciutto.  Broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  There is no thick outer crust.  The flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  The beef is dense and oily.  It has a very different mouth feel.  It is extremely sweet.  Amazing but not for everyone.

Tip:  Request the "Riserva" steaks when making reservation.  The amount of aging doesn't matter.  The piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.

Traditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  The rib eye and porterhouse both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  Excellent sear, tender and juicy.  Both steaks are meant to be shared.  If dining alone, both the bone in New York strip and Bone in filet mignon offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.

All steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  It imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.

Not into aged beef?  The 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  Natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  It's dry rubbed with thyme and porcini powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  A drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.

For starters, the fried calamari, "Shrimp alla Diavola", and Bucatini Amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  You can get these at Batali's Italian eatery, B&B Ristorante.

The restaurant captures the spirit of Italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  Don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  The bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.

Bravo!

It is another Old Town bar with douchy bouncers at the door and scantily clad bar gals (not sure they deserve the title bartender because they are paid to look cute and be young, not be mixologists).  They don't really have that great of a beer selection, which I would expect from a place with the name Bottled Blonde. The DJ has been quite fabulous the few times I have been here (nice remix of older songs mixed in with the hip and new).   I don't think I would ever eat here, unless I was inebriated and my taste buds were impaired.  But in comparison to other bars in the 'vortex of the Old Town Bermuda triangle' I recommend it.

"Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound?
That only echoes through the night."

The French Canadian with pipes like an angel, the gifted Celine Dion.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#Kbvx9GtNiElinZ0HzpQ_Lw

Celine looked absolutely stunning, captivating the Friday night audience with her melodic voice & touching lyrics.  I felt quite a few goosebumps as she sang hits such as-

"But when you touch me like this,
and when you hold me like that.
I just have to admit,
that it's all coming back to me."

Our seats located in the rear orchestra had a great view of the stage, off center left.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#w6Yz3Dx-Wgzi0dRHERURxQ

Celine did several covers of other artists' songs, but I would've preferred if she sang more of her music library.  She even performed 2 hologram duets, one of which was interestingly enough, with herself.  Can't say I didn't get the most Celine Dion for the dollar ;p

"Cause I am your lady,
and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can."

Of course, the song that everyone anticipates, "My Heart Will Go On", lived up to all expectations & mesmerized the fortunate concert goers.  Towards the end of the song, Celine was surrounded by falling water that artistically cascaded down to make a magical experience, both audio & visual.  Think Fountains of Bellagio in reverse.

Can't have a concert w/o merchandise
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#84ZlgUYEgyq-PDy-eNr-YA

A true showstopper & deserving of headlining the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace,  Celine Dion puts on an extravagant show that will pull the heartstrings & touch you to your very soul.  Her powerful voice wil captivate & strike you with awe as to how such strength can come from such a small frame.  A tremendous show that absolutely has to be experienced before her run is done.

Highly recommend!

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

Finally a gelateria that rivals those of Firenze or Roma; almost.  The Italian spirit is alive and well.  A myriad of made fresh daily gelato, a warm smile, tastes of this and that offered enthusiastically. 

Product Pros:
- Made fresh daily.
- Good density and smooth texture of the gelato.  Near creamy, texture for the sorbetto.
- Well extracted, clean, concentrated flavors.  Fruit flavors in the mango and strawberry excellent.  Both taste and smell like the sun ripened fruit.  Pistachio, avocado, and white coffee (a baked rather than roasted bean that has the flavor of roasted nuts and an herbaceous tea like finish), all aromatic and deeply flavored.
- The gelato base flavor, fior di latte (milk's flower), milky, creamy, fatty in a good way.  Well controlled sweetness.
- Great savory flavors.  Well balanced flavors.  The rosemary and EVOO, classically Italian with the hint of rosemary aroma and taste finishing peppery with the flavor of olive oil.  The chocolate with pasilla and red chilies; brooding, almost bitter chocolate flavor with a spicy kick on the finish.

Product Cons:
- Pasteurized milk and the terrior is not evident.
- Sweetness of inventive dessert flavors mimics the real dessert (ie peach cobbler).  High and cloying.

Note:  They make gelato for several restaurants including Novecento Pizzeria.  Freshness matters.  Make the trek to experience the best.

Enjoy it now as the Vegas temperatures climb into the 70's. In a few months when it's 110 outside, you'll be looking at a puddle in seconds and that's just sad

2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it "Hawaiian".
3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me "brah" or asking if I "hang ten" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.

How does it stack up?

Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.

Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.
 
A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.

A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.

Three Square Food Bank is the local non-profit that supplies food and household items to area charities for distribution to those in need.  They don't distribute directly to families, instead they collect all of the items, sort it, and sell it to organizations who serve the needy.

My family has been volunteering here for over 2 yrs.  My Son spends many hours during the Summer and my Wife and I volunteer when we can.  There are many jobs that you can work.  Most of the time we help in the warehouse area sorting food and household items.  It's monotonous work, but if volunteers don't do it the work doesn't get done quickly as there are so many items to sort.

The facility is large and well kept.  The workers there are passionate about their job and are very patient with us volunteers.  With so many volunteers that rotate in/out of the place they must have a lot of patience to train us.

I encourage everyone to consider doing it.  It's really easy to sign up.....fill out a form online and then show up on scheduled dates/times.  Here's the link to more info and to the online volunteer form:
http://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/

We enjoy working here and will continue to volunteer as long as we're a part of this community.

HEALTH IS HAPPINESS

  The Peccole Ranch Walking Trail (PRWT) is an unsigned Summerlin trail system in the neighborhood bounded by Hualapai Way to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, Fort Apache Avenue to the east, and Sahara Avenue to the south. After experiencing PRWT, I see it as three connected concrete trails winding through a continuous linear park. Trail 1 starts at Hualapai Way to the west which is 0.4 miles north of Sahara Avenue. A tunnel carries it under Grand Canyon Drive. After intersecting with a spur trail, it heads northeast. A second tunnel carries it under Red Hills Drive. Leaving the tunnel it parallels Apple Drive up to it concludes at Trail 2 near Charleston Boulevard. This is the physical fitness trail. Fitness stations with cooresponding descriptive signs adorn the parkscape. They include a vertical ladder, chinning bars, and squat-stretch bench. If health is happiness, this is the trail to happiness. Trail 2 runs south of the commercial and residential development along Charleston Boulevard from Hualapai Way to a couple hundred feet east of the Apple Drive tunnel. Trail 2 weaves through a linear disk golf course. Trail 3 is the spur trail off Trail 1, which continues the due-east direction of PRWT past a surface crossing with Preakness Pass to the easternmost point at Fort Apache Road.

  In late November, I spent a couple of hours enjoying an adventure on PRWT. It reminded me of its sister linear parks in Summerlin: The Pueblo Park and Cottonwood Canyon. However, there were a few characteristics that separated PRWT from its sister linear parks. In comparison, it is a more compressed space bordered by walls instead of larger homes up on hills; with the exception of the trail east of Preakness Pass,  the landscape is golf course green grass; and parking lots are nonexistent. 

  My adventures along PRWT color me impressed. Graffiti is nonexistent. Mature pine trees and colorful trees that left sprinklets of fallen leaves on golf course green grass attracted birds. Birds were everywhere. Many of the adjacent backyards have humingbird feeders. The white concrete trail is a work of art that gently weaved between the bordering walls of the linear park and under picturesque tunnels. Green streetlamps complimented the parkscape. The gentle inclines added texture to the trail. And the fitness stations are a celebration of good health.

  This is an unadvertised trail. Signing and parking lots are nonexistent. My advice is to park at either the Sahara West Library parking lot or Hualapai Commons Shopping Center anchored by Smith's at the southeast corner of Charleston and Hualapai. To reach PRWT from the Sahara West Library, you will walk north on Grand Canyon Drive for 0.4 miles until you reach the overpass. The Hualapai Commons is adjacent to PRWT. Both parking lots are a relatively short distance east of the 215.

  After spending a couple of hours exploring PRWT I felt uplifted and a few pounds lighter than when I came into the trail. I felt healthy! As the sign says on the fitness trail "health is happiness. " And because this is the season of giving, I want to give people happiness by recommending an adventure on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail.

Salmon Craving Satisfied in Vegas - Who'da Thought!

SITREP

I found myself hitting the Happy Hour here at Red Square (located at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino) and it did not disappoint.  

THE SETUP

My sweet dance partner and I were jone'sin for some munchies before we hit a dance competition event, but there was not going to be any food there.

Interestingly enough, we had just talked about our uncles - how they both hail from Idaho - and hers is sportsman who catches Salmon from the Snake River.  So as we arrived into Red Square, two (2) menu items just JUMPED OUT at us, like 2 Chinooks, and so we "jumped on them", so to speak.

LE MENU

The items had Salmon on them!  So for us, this was meant to be:

(1)  I saw the Siberian Nachos, which consisted of Salmon, Crispy Potato Gautrette, Sour Cream, and Caviar, believe it not.  Absolutely delicious, and probably the most singularly different nachos I've ever had; and then,

(2)  We were BOTH intrigued by the Smoked Salmon Pizza, which consisted of generous strips of smoked salmon & pickled red onions.  [The flavor of the pickled red onions  was a bit much for Cassandra, but we resolved that issue by picking them off.]

THE LOWDOWN

Definitely plan on coming back to Red Square again when I hit Vegas again.

Dear Mike, 

As Debbie Boone said in the mid 70s for over 52 weeks, You Light Up My Life. As Elton John belted out so many times, You're Like A Candle In The Wind. And as the Doors famously sang Come On Baby Light My Fire! 

We all know it's about the accessories right. And Mike, girl, you sure know how to decorate. Thank you for prettying up our restaurant with your votives, vases and va va voom! Your votives provide just the perfect lighting for our guests. Kinda like the soft back lighting Barbra Streisand demands in any film she makes. 

And a visit to your showroom....was like...nirvana baby! I totally wanted to play house like I would do at furniture stores when I was a kid. Ok a teenager. Ok Ok...like I did last week at Crate & Barrel. Sheez! 

And yes. If you want to introduce Kathy Griffin to me, I suppose it's ok. Obviously her career could use a boost and I think it's important to help those out that are less fortunate! 

Kisses, 
Thomas

I guess I should've looked at Brian S's review before I dropped off my clothing at Prestige.  Or, maybe I should've listened to my boyfriend when he told me to ask at Prestige how much each item would be for dry cleaning.  Of course, I didn't... and for that I was punished when I received the bill.

$16 to dry clean a Banana Republic dress that probably cost me $50 to purchase.  That's ridiculous!

Ready for more insanity?
1 shirt/blouse - $14.10 (it had beads on it but still!)
1 dress (another sundress) - $18.40
1 pair of capri pants - $9.10
1cotton blouse - $8.10

Total damage - $65.70

Yes, I am extremely embarrassed that I wasted so much $$ on dry cleaning that I could've had done at the $1.99 cleaners instead!  I would have saved $55.70!  That is a lot of money!

Needless to say, I will not be back to Prestige unless I go to pick up Jared's shirts there.  I guess that's the only decently priced item.  He gets them laundered for $2.25 a pop.

Good luck to you and your high prices, Prestige Cleaners!

Hmmm...interesting concept. Is it a store? Is it a museum? Not sure. But one thing's for sure, it is sparse. But pretty. Kind of like I imagine Jessica Simpson's mind would be. Vintage, couture...lots of beautiful clothing. But. Do. Not. Touch. Yes, we were told to not touch anything. Well. We could touch ourselves, but that's another story. So? Museum? Hmmm...still not sure. We had a delightful and informed employee/manager/owner explain to us their concept. Well. I never really got it. All I know is that where this vintage Halston dress that I can't touch once occupied the space for gay/indie flicks section at the now adios Movies On Central. 

Ok. I don't get the concept. But the fashions were exquisite. Including the display furniture and book collection. But. I didn't touch any of it. Cuz. They scared me. Really? Don't touch the clothes. Please don't pick the daisies (anyone who gets this reference is OLD!)

Weird. Cool. Different. Like me in jr. high. But, I kinda like this place.

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

Earl of Sandwich serves $6 sandwiches 24 hours a day. The problem is that the one and only sandwich I tried was extremely disappointing. I asked the lady at the counter for the most popular sandwich and she said, "Get the Earl Club." So, I did.

Sadly, the strongest flavor for the Club was Charcoal because the crust of the Bread was burned just enough to make it snap-hard and bitter while the Bacon was 2 strips of even crunchier charcoal crisps. With skimpy toppings, light on the cheese, and not enough flavor to overcome the burnt taste, the Earl Club was a miss. I ate most of the Turkey and Cheese, but let the rest hit the trash can on the way out.

The convenience of being connected to the Planet Hollywood Casino and Miracle Mile of Shops was nice, but the Earl of Sandwich was a losing bet in a city full of great eats. Treat it as a late night stomach-stuffer for $6. Nothing more. Nothing less.

This thing is no joke.

Back in October, I attempted a hike up this mountain. I made it 10 minutes before I had to turn back around like a little biatch.

This past Saturday, I woke up rather early, and felt inspired. Strong. I packed up my Camelbak for Camelback.

Couple things to note. If you get there at 7:00AM, the parking lot will be full, and you will have to park off 56th street and walk one mile.

Pack lots of water. If you have a Camelbak, bring extra in bottles, just in case. Also, if you are doing this solo, like I did...bring headphones, and a playlist with a ton of songs.

This hike is pretty challenging. Its only 1.2-1.5 miles each way, but it's practically a rock climb for many different parts. The hardest parts are at the very beginning. Use the rails or the fence, and you will be fine.

Don't give up on his hike. You WILL get to the top. If an obese man like me can do it, so can a sexy individual like yourself. Hop to it tiger. Show us your tiger's blood.

Oh yeah...and about the water. When I got to the top, my Camelbak was empty. I had to spend 90 minutes going down without water.....Pack extra.

Sometimes we forget that our reviews directly effect those businesses.

I'm not suggesting that we should go soft, but in coming here I found a small Mom & Pop setup that is still trying to find their way.  This Food Court is new, and there are only three options as of this writting.  To say that Villa Italian Kitchen is not as good as Sbarro is an understatement. I'm not a big fan of watching employees microwave food to be served.

But in watching them closely, you could see they were on a steep learning curve and should be cut some slack.  Well, at least I have for now.  Until next time then.

I came here for dinner one evening and found their burger to be one of tastiest I've tried in greater Phoenix. 

It was a Friday night and I started out with their Blue Cheese Iceberg Wedge (photo).  As you can see it was smothered in bacon, blue cheese and dressing. I wouldn't even guess at the caloric intake for this cardiac arrest special, but it was well worth it. 

As for my equal delicious pre-ER meal, I ordered their Blue Burger for $14.00. My burger was cooked properly, to medium/medium rare with a warm pink inside (see photo), then let to cool to keep all the juices inside. You just don't expect such care at your local family burger place. 

Dinner ran me $25, but it was worth every penny.  

Enjoy!

This was the first time for me using the new Terminal 3 at McCarran... One word, awesome, can sum it up! This new terminal definitely has the wow factor built in... Big, open areas leading to the arrival/departure gates, nice restaurants and shops, well lit and lots of room to move around. There is an airport train system that will transport you to the baggage claim area and after you get your bags, easy access to ground transportation is right outside the doors.  The most impressive feature for me was the escalators and stairs down to the lower level where the train system is.  It gave me the feeling of being in a huge hall type setting and was quite nice. It's a big improvement to the old terminal which I had grown so accustomed to over the many years of flying into Las Vegas. I had to navigate the new terminal, but by the time I left, it was a snap!

For my 725th review, I wanted to share a dope alternative to a club in Vegas.  We stopped by here for a drink before having dinner at the Cosmo.  Chandelier is tri-level, w/ the 2nd level being the best in my opinion.

Top shelf drinks were only $10, vs most places that charge $15.  The place is very swanky, w/ a bar on each level, and lounge seats on the side.  In addition, the bartenders and clientele are chill.  We didn't feel any arrogance, and no one cut in line vs Marquee.  Lastly, the vibe is low key vs a lot of clubs in town.

Chandelier is highly recommended for a drink before or after dinner, or if you prefer something more chill vs a club.  A great place to hang out w/ friends or impress a date.

That awkward moment when a club is suppose to show off what it has on opening night. I guess it was to bad I was a dude. Arrived late because honestly everything starts at 11pm anyways, to be told, as almost ever other guy in line, the would not be letting anymore males in. This happens at most places in Scottsdale but given the fact it was me and three women I thought I would be fine, but was very mistaken they were told they could go in, but without me, cause that made sense.

None the less, I guess I will not be spending my money here.

They have a 5 dollar lunch special every day from 11-3. Oh did I mention its bomb!!

Yesterday it was angus burger w sweet potato fries and a gelato.. $$5.00 bucks !!!

Today I got the small soup(not small at all) and a 6 inch fresh bagette (didnt cut the roof of my mouth) with avacado bacon and turkey. The bread tasted seriously like it just came from the oven . Oh and it was $$5 

On mondays they do a 1/2off organic milkshake, which is super good. 

Best freaking deal, for real food, well just food in general. And its damn good

Consistently outstanding Sapporo ramen 5200 miles from the source! (If it doesn't sound far think of it as a minimum of two layovers and 16 hours flying.  Bam!)

Sora is simplicity at its best:

- One bowl of perfectly cooked, slightly chewy ramen.

- Two choices of  flavorful broth (salt or miso).

- Three topping combinations:  basic (excellent chashu, soft boiled egg, and veg), Sapporo  (basic plus butter and corn),  or "American"  (basic with three times more chashu and/or nori).  

- Like it spicy?  Add a Thai garlic chili paste.

- Sides?  OK fried rice, OK chashu bits on rice, OK curry on rice, Good but oily gyoza. (NO TONKATSU)

Efficient service.  It's Japanese fast food after all.

Pushing the limit for Vegas cheap eats at around $9.00 a bowl but well worth it for the quality and uniqueness.  Try it soon.  It might not be so great when its 110 outside.

I really wish I could have my money back. And I'm kind of embarrassed that this was a gift activity too.  I'm writing this review actually, as I stand in a Disney-length of line to partake in a simple and probably overrated video game activity. Pretty sure the website hyped this up much more than needed. The "times of entry" that you purchase tickets for, are overcrowded, for one... And for the first 45 mins you are here, nothing is happening.

There is a ratio of 5:1 kids to adults. The age of these kids!? 3-6 years old. The rules and FAQs do specifically state that this experience is for older kids and adults. And sure enough... A kid is crying next to me while the mother yells at the poor staff member because her kid is too small and unable to activate the video sensors. 

For the price of $30 per person, and then paying $10 for parking... You too can enjoy crowded rooms full of snot nose kids, screaming parents, long lines to pathetic "experiences" and a marvel themed caf!!!

In the inception of my Yelping I was giving away five star reviews like U of A was giving away TD's to ASU!  I am now learning that four stars is now my high score unless I am totally blown away and is why I am updating my review.  Yin's Chinese Restaurant is a throw back.  Their interior decor is a bit dated but adds to the ambience of the experience.  This little gem is family owned and always prefer it to a corporate spot at all costs.  The most important this about Yin's is the customer service followed but the delicious menu and topped off by the cost!  Big Bang for the buck here.  The valley has changed throughout the times but when I lived in this area in the early 90's it was really nice.  Do not let the area scare you off by giving them a chance.  Support this Mom and Pop's establishment to ensure we don't lose another.

The Cosmopolitan had high hopes for 10 girls staying here for my cousin's Bachelorette party. 

The main front check in area is very flashy and nice. The chandelier is also beautiful. Our city suite room is spacious, bathroom has a nice view. 

That's about it... Do yourself a favor and don't book any rooms here. The service is horrible. Room service is unprofessional. This is the first & last time we will be staying here. 

Reasons why:
They don't treat their guests well. 
Had to pay for Marquee's pool party. when we were guests.
Our room keys didn't work, we had to go down to the front desk OVER 5 times to get it to work!! WTF?
our phones did not work the entire weekend, had to call from the other girl's room!!
When called about buffet price, was told the wrong price that was for week days only. 
Room service never restocked toilet paper or tissue paper, nor redid the beds.
 Found a disgusting men's sandal behind a chair.

Don't book here even if your life depends on it.

Oh you fancy, huh? 

That's pretty much what I thought when I walked into the Crystals shopping center. 

Located next to the Aria Hotel, Crystal's is one of, if not the fanciest, most upscale shopping centers on the Las Vegas Strip.

I loved looking in all the beautiful shops. I loved looking at all the impressive displays, statues and water tornado thingy's but to be honest, I can't afford to shop in any of Crystal's stores. Nope. Not one. I'm not poor by any means but you gotta be a baller to shop here. 

When doing my shopping in Vegas I'll just stick to The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, a place where both peasants and royalty can shop in unison. 

And does anyone know how this place stays in business? I went in here twice and it was DEAD. Even on a super busy Saturday afternoon.

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

This place is NOT SAFE!!! I came back to my room with my wife & her two friends after attending a wedding that evening to a scroungey smoking male leaving OUR ROOM with a black sack full of OUR BELONGINGS! Apparently security had been called on this "suspect fellow" 20 min prior and they were IN THE HALL as the man proceeded to ATTACK me and grab me by the throat and then run into the Service Elevator Room and escape through the SERVICE ELEVATORS.... ALL IN FRONT OF SECURITY, WHO WALKED SLUGGISHLY TO US! They didn't even jog!!! And their response to us being attacked and robbed in front of them was to offer to write a report "if we wanted to"!!! OF COURSE WE WANTED TO. And then they continued to try to talk us out of calling the Police, which we ignored and called ourself to file a report with the police. 

Absolutely sketchy and unnacceptable! And on top of it all, management refused to compensate our rooms for the nights stay!! Never coming back, I like my safety more!

I ordered a Denver Omelette which came with country potatoes and an English Muffin. I liked that they had plenty of strawberry jam packets on the table so that I could decorate my English Muffin. And to complete the job I piled on some Omelette on top of the English Muffin. A perfect combination of ham, onions, green peppers, eggs, English Muffin and of course strawberry jam.

The country potatoes were also delicious. So I would definitely order this combination again when I visit The Good Egg next time I'm in the area.

I know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. 

Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. 

Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.

Venturing out and trying new AYCE spots in town! 

I am really anxious when trying new places, because very rarely does it surprise...in a good way at least.  But Naka does well!

Some highlights :

Great quality nigiri here!  They had very fresh Ahi, Sake, Fresh Sea Scallops and Hamachi.  I was surprised they had Anago on the AYCE menu, and it was pretty fresh.  The Uni was a bit watery in consistency but it still had a smooth flavor/finish.

Fresh Oysters....these were great! Love the ponzu like sauce and hot sauce combination!

Soft Shell Crab appetizer. This was a large crab, cooked well, and surprisingly meaty! Yum :)

Sashimi Salad. Lots of great tasting ahi with a tasty dressing and greens. 

Fried Jalapeno Popper...surprisingly spicy! Loved the spicy mayo concoction on top.

Service was fast and friendly.  I say if you are on this side of town, you should give it a go!

Good lunch option for Vegas! 

We started with the Japanese Wagyu Gyoza and all I can say is, wow! This little pockets pack a ton of flavor. I kind of wanted to order another round but I refrained. 

The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. 

The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again. 

The place was packed so service was a bit spotty, but I'd come back again and stick to the tiraditos and gyoza.

THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER IN LVG CLUB I'VE EVER HAD.

LAVO your food is mediocre and thank you for a special entry passes to your nightclub. Yes, your special meatball is pretty darn tasty.

To be honest, I think thats where the problem begins. You let people eat here and get a special pass for the club. HOLY MACARONI. your nightclub was so crowded it was so bad. Up to a point my body was dancing by itself because people were squeezing me left and right. Drinks were spilled all over the floor. Slippery much? is this a club or ice skating rink? Dance? what dance? I can hardly move and breathe. AND COME ON! THOSE STAIRS? don't you know we girls wear at least 5 inches of high heels? ugh. 

Oh yeah, better music though compare to XS. But omg, never again for this nightclub.

Is this the trail to Payard's Place, was all I said
This concierge has heard that question lots before
We strolled through Caesar's Casino and marched straight ahead
It was on a corner curve
From an inside counter serve
It was there where we saw the macarons.

The waitress poured our water into tiny cups
She got the caprese sandwich from the fridge
She took crepe batter from a tin and whipped it up
Added mushrooms, chicken, cream
It was a Paris cafe dream
Expensive, but ended too soon

Those summer nights, when we were free
Four-day vacation for wifey and me
Travel eaters, travel eaters
And in our quest for macarons
We stumbled on these DESERT MOONs
Vegas dreamers, Vegas dreamers
Of DESERT MOONs
Of macarons
Of DESERT MOONs
Of macarons

Caprese sandwich mozzarella fresh and light
Basil and tomato so mixed well
The chicken crepe needed something to make it right
We got mojito mint cheesecake
Too rich for me to take
And then we got to our macarons

I've never had a macaron I've liked before
Europane has the closest to me heart
But when I tried this Payard disk, I wanted more
The fillings not too sweet
A flaky cookie treat
These desserts made my tongue and heart swoon

Those summer nights, when we were free
Four-day vacation for wifey and me
Travel eaters, travel eaters
And in our quest for macarons
We stumbled on these DESERT MOONs
Vegas dreamers, Vegas dreamers

Question: who the eff asked for more asians in the clubs? 

Hakkasan was a major fail in my book for many reasons.  I would say skip this place unless your ideal mate is a 5'0" asian male. 

First of all, the managers and promoters are incredibly rude and 'require photo submission' to get on guestlist. seriously, WHAAT?! you know those hot girls in 5inch heels and skin-tight dresses? HELL no do they want to walk half a mile, just to go up and down a bajillion stairs. Get it together; your club sucks and Lady LingLing is unsatisfied.

Also, no outdoor pool/patio area? how's a girl supposed to hustle some drinks then? Hakksan has the perfect recipe for failure: expensive as hell + thirsty girls + rude management + terrible layout= unhappy vegas-goers. Back to XS, I go.

This is a great place for Happy Hour and special times like birthdays, etc. I went here for a birthday and really enjoyed it. We happened to arrive during Happy Hour so our dinner choices were a lot cheaper. We ordered the cheese flat bread and the rice bowl. Both were outstanding. Portions were so big that we had to request containers to take leftovers home and the delicious chocolate cake we chose for dessert came with a candle and was free! Wonderful service, great atmosphere and terrific food...highly recommend St. Francis.

Charlie's has 4 to 5 star potential... Neither my complaints nor my compliments seem to be new to anything anyone else has said but I am egomaniacal so I will go ahead and write them again.

They are hip and fun. Dancing for the cowboys and everyone else...as long as you can two step. I was scolded for dancing in a manner that was not the two step...when my dance partners and I cleared it left no one on the dance floor. Yup we were the only ones out there. An empty Dance floor is better than one with non two steppers it turns out.

The crowd is good though and you don't have to be intimidated if you are not a cowboy (so long as you are a non-cowboy who can two-step). The drinks are strong and cheap. I went on Friday and they were 75 cents! Mmm cheap booze.

The patio is amazing and tent like and temperature controlled. A smoker's paradise.

The women folk were asked to take their purses and leave them in the car...you know cuz cowboys don't carry purses. 

I have been more than once, would easily return again but I can think of more laid back places and laid back is more conducive to fun. Oh on the weekends they do have awesome carne asada outside. I am headed there right now.

Let it be known... flash mobs are not allowed at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I learned this the hard way and I am no longer allowed to set foot in my go-to shopping mall for the next year.

Despite the "no flash mob" rule, I've been a loyal customer for years.  SFS is a shopper's paradise.  It has pretty much everything you might be looking for from Nordstrom, Neiman's and Macy's to Crate and Barrel, Banana Republic, Anthropology, Hugo Boss, Tiffany, etc... They also have a movie theater and food court and lots of other restaurants to choose from including Z' Tejas, Fred's at Barney's, Modern Steak / Modern Burger, Grand Luxe, and more.

356 days left until I can set foot in Scottsdale Fashion Square again... until then, I'll be spending my $$ at local boutiques, the Biltmore Fashion Park, Scottsdale Quarter, and Kierland Commons.

Feel free to PM me for a link to the aforementioned flash mob if you haven't seen it yet... and happy shopping!

After much delay, Autostrada is finally open, surprisingly with little fanfare.   The couple we were meeting had trouble finding the new Italian osteria in DC Ranch.  Apart from a large red "A" vinyl on the doors, there was no other signage.  It's located at the intersection across from The Armitage.

The menu is simple and straightforward at very palatable prices - nothing is over $18.  Food is encouraged to be shared family style.  All of which sounds like a great concept in a recessionary environment.

None of the antipasti piqued our interest so we jumped straight to the pastas. Fettuccine with scallops and mushrooms ($17) and orchiette with pork sugo and peas.  The marscapone sauce on the fettucine was deliciously creamy although a touch heavy handed.  The pork sugo was a bit too sweet and the dish just fell flat for us.

For the main, we shared the roasted sea bass with fennel and tomato ($16) and NY strip steak (pre-sliced for easy sharing) on potato and sunchoke puree.  Both were solid dishes.  Steak had great flavor but oddly it was not sliced across the grain and had a little gristle.

Our favorites were the contorni (aka sides). The tiella - baked layers of eggplant, zucchini & tomato topped with parmesan was packed with flavor and delicious just as Gabi said.  The baby artichokes were fried to a nice crisp on the outside contrasting nicely with the tender interior.

For dessert, we chose vanilla bean panna cotta with sliced strawberries and the marscapone tart with poached pears and spiced walnuts.  Again both were solid dishes.

The interior has an industrial cool vibe to it with a long metal bench running along the wall and a stainless steel walled kitchen that runs across, separated by glass so you can get a full view of the action from most of the dining room.  There is an equal if not greater number of seating outdoors including tables for up to 8.

Autostrada serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Over Easy and The Lodge fame's latest dining destination.

They are reminiscent of Ore Ida. But that's cool, cuz I like 'em. And if you could slow down when slapping my toppings on those de lish sizzling patties...messy is good, but I eventually just made a salad out of that last burger. Chopped it all up and ate it with a fork. And eventually, my fingers. So Lenny. I think Squiqqy is distracting you. I know you're the Lone Wolf and all, but focus, focus focus.

Their dedication to customer service here is unparalleled! After my last review with the soggy pizza, they wrote me to offer me a pizza to replace the other and give them another chance at my convenience. While it never crossed my mind to stop patronizing this establishment, the gesture meant a lot! 

Every pizza that I have had since has been top notch! The last time I was in the joint to pick up pizzas I mentioned my previous experience with the driver waiting for me to get back into my apartment, and they were like "oh that's you!!" Only slightly embarrassed about locking myself out, and being recognized by my Yelp reviews. I guess I'm pretty much famous now. =P

They also have Mexican Cokes in the bottle!

Alright Tao, you've redeemed yourself in my book! Unlike some other wannabe hotspots in Vegas (rhymes with Insanity), Tao gets it and treats the ladies right!

My girls and I bypassed the line and were led to a VIP table without any attitude. We also got hooked up with open bar for an hour. The bartenders were friendly and so were the rest of the staff.

We had a plush area to lounge in and a platform behind us to dance on top of. The dance floor filled up quick, so it was nice to have our own area to shake our booties. 

Music was 90's hip hop early on in the night, so we had a fun time before we left for XS.

Thanks for the awesome VIP treatment, guys!!

I've found myself at this library several times sp far this year.  

 Each time that I have been to this library, it has been for a meeting of some sort. The library may not be the first place that organizers think to host a meeting, but this happens to be one of the more perfect spots.  This library can be the perfect place for a meeting that might pull in people from all over the valley.  This library is in a very central location, it is on the East side of Central Ave and is just above the I10 and South of McDowell.

I have been to meetings in the Pulliam Room.  This room is fairly large with a wonderful sound system and technical amenities.  My only problem with this room is that the required rental is 4 hours, but the seats are HARD wooden seats.  Not so nice on the bottom if you're sitting for 4 hours.

I have also attended meetings in Meeting Room A and Room B.  Small rooms with no audio visual equipment, minimal amenities, and awkwardly situated in the same hallway as the restrooms, so there is a lot of traffic and noise right outside the door when your meeting is in progress.

All in all, this is a nice library.

I walked in with my sister and my boyfriend.  We wanted to see a menu before sitting down.  We were greeted by someone in a way-too-tight nurse's costume.  Every single man in the place turned around and stared at us.  Every man in there sat alone at the counter with a beer.  I wondered if we had accidentally walked into a strip club, based on the layout, the customers, and the wait staff.  The little nurse politely but loudly told us the menu was painted on the wall.  Heart attack burgers, "flat line fries", unfiltered lucky strikes and buckets of beer.  That's it.  So we turned around and politely walked out as fast as we could.

Picked up from the airport and AGAIN a complaint about where I'm going. Sorry cabbies, I like to hit up Mr Lucky's in the Hard Rock for some chicken soup and a sammie when I get off a long plane ride (yea, typically I'm hurting a bit). 

'Hard Rock? Not far!' Complains the driver. He didn't say anything after that, so I'll 2-star it instead of 1, but why are these people such d!cks? Quit your whining. You're back at the airport in 5 for a other pickup. Another bad impression given to any new person arriving in this town. Thanks, Ace!

Bonus: He forgot I said HRH and brought me to the regular hotel entrance

Side note: Nicole (who responds but ultimately does nothing to all of these cab complaints), please don't waste your time and message me.

FEZ is poshy and obnoxious, like the restaurants on Santana Row. Yet it was surprisingly inviting, mostly due to our awesome server.

We came here for late dinner. Our server was nice enough to extend the happy hour menu to us at the table since the bar was packed and we really wanted the bar bites!

Cheese fondue (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg?select=s-DoCgOwLo0-XoDuIhfBGA): Big portion. The cheese was gooey and delicious! The combination of grilled zucchini and cheese was surprisingly tasty! We loved it!

Deep fried poppers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg?select=rsusUomr1--LF_3qE3EN2A): I was quite intrigued by how perfectly round the poppers were. Sweet red peppers filled with cream cheese. A bit disappointed since they weren't spicy. The aioli did add a kick though.

Love happy hours! Especially late night! =D

This place is super-clean with a friendly staff (mostly Spanish-speaking but I'm fluent so THERE :P).  There are *no* pigeons running around this place.  Always a plus!
You use a card here, no quarters dug from under the couch cushions.  I like that.  
The place is spotless.  There's always someone cleaning up.  The machines are regularly cleaned out of forgotten socks and panties.
They even have a little store with a variety of different detergents!  
They are open late, which seems to be when I go there.  Many TVs throughout, tuned into different stations.  There's even a PacMan machine to play!

Wet 'n' Wild is now open in Glendale, off Pinnacle Peak on 43rd Ave. This park replaces the now defunct WaterWorld. $30 million was spent on building the 30 new slides and attractions at the brand new park. We checked out the park on one of the season pass holders preview days.

This is certainly a hundred times better than the old, crappy Waterworld park. It is by far the best amusement park in Arizona. We had a great time checking out a bunch of the new slides and we will be here often during the hot AZ summer. Lots of big slides for adults and big kids and also a kiddie area for the little ones.

I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 due to the following drawbacks:
They charge for parking, even if you are a season pass holder.
There is no alcohol served on site.
They charge for renting intertubes if you want to use a tube at the wave pool.
No towels are provided.

Other than these few negatives, Wet 'n' Wild is an impressive waterpark and a much needed addition to the blistering valley of the sun. Go get yourself some Wet 'n' Wild.

After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday. 
Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs. 

I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day. 

I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway. 

WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG! 

This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric. 

Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too! 

P.S. 
For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you.

There is a lot of hype about this place and although it is a good time, it is not very different than any of the other pool parties in Vegas, but with a lot more expense.

One piece of advice though, DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges, they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.  And the MGM will not get involved to help settle the dispute unless you charge your bill through your room.

Spread the word fellow Yelpers, its not worth the trouble or expense.

Our feet and back were hurting so badly after browsing around at Glendale Glitters.  We needed a place to rest and probably use a more decent restroom than the portables. We stumbled into Krispy Creations just opened last month. Another wonderful addition to downtown Glendale. 

If you are absolutely obsessed with rice krispy treats, Krispy Creations adapted them from a normal cake batter.  We didn't try any of their rice krispy treats. We did try the clam chowder soup in a baked bread bowl.  I love that the bread was baked hot and crunchy.  The soup was semi-homemade, but so comforting and delicious in the winter.  They also make their own dipped chocolate strawberry!   The owner is really sweet and friendly. Go support local if you're in downtown Glendale.

Fantastic spot for a fun group dinner in Vegas! We had a table of 12 hungry girls but they easily accommodated our party. 

We did a prix fixe menu. We started with the "pigs in a blanket," Caesar salads and spicy chicken wings. Everything was delicious. You could taste the anchovy lightly in the caesar and the wings and 'pigs' were hard not to devour. Each came with wonderful dipping sauces! 

For our entrees we had the roast chicken, truffle penne with proscuitto and peas and mashed potatoes and broccoli. The mashed potatoes were the best I've had in a long time. 

Raspberry filled donuts came out for dessert with a vanilla dipping sauce... Yum! Great meal before a night out dancing!

Roy's Train World has a wide selection of O, S, HO and N gauge model trains, along with many hard to find books.

Given our location in the southwest, they have a bunch of Union Pacific, old Santa Fe and Southern Pacific rolling stock and diesel engines, see photos.  But, they also have some Canadian Pacific, Penn Central, CTA and other lines as well.  Roy's will also take old model trains on consignment to sell.

I have found Roy's to be a great toy train store, run by a very friendly, knowledgeable owner.  If you are making a trip to they Arizona Railway Museum in Chandler, I would recommend stopping here. If only to checkout the models of what you just saw in real scale.

Enjoy!

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

The people complaining about the way Chars looks have no idea what a Juke Joint (or a Honky Tonk if that's your flavor.  Dive Bar if you can relate to that) is supposed to look like.  The lights are supposed to be dim.... the place is supposed to be small... The place will have a band that doesn't care if their makeup is on correctly.... the place should make you question if the walls might fall down if the music gets any louder and the dance floor should be small as JUKE JOINTS are usually kinda small!!!!!  Somebody please educate these folks on JUKE JOINTS.... Meanwhile, let me tell you about Chars.

If you're looking for absolutely NO pretentiousness, NO frills, Tables that don't cost $600, or basically the opposite of clubbing in Scottsdale .... Chars is your spot.  If you are interested in Rhythm and Blues and Soul covers and a rocking good time.... Chars is your spot.  If you are looking for a live music venue where people dance AND mingle with each other and actually speak and talk to you just because... Chars is your spot.  If you have stumbled upon my review because you are looking for a decent time.... Chars is your spot.  

 I absolutely LOVE Chars for everything that it is AND for everything that it is NOT.

TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!

Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.

Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.
Neither was delivered on this visit.

I may or may not go there again

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

Vegas' top sushi restaurant.

NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  

Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.

Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.

Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.

Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.

Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.

Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  

For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!

Highly recommended.

Was essen Syrer respektive was erwartet mich in einem syrischen Restaurant? 

Mit diesen Fragen betraten wir das Alibaba und bevor wir auch nur einen Bissen gekostet zu haben, weiss ich nun, dass das syrische Essen hier beliebt ist. Doppelt gebucht sind am Wochenende die Tische, so dass wer ohne Reservierung aufschlgt, erstmal keine Chance hat. Dass wir doch noch zu zwei Tellern fanden lag an unserer Hartnckigkeit, daran dass die Mdels mglich machten, was irgend mglich war und sicherlich auch darin begrndet, das wir bereits um 19 Uhr aufschlugen.

So fanden wir nicht nut einen Platz, um uns rum war es sogar ziemlich leer und wir konnten uns in Ruhe   dem Alibabataller (Kufta mit 5 Vorspeisen) sowie der Grillvariation widmen. Dazu kommt Brot und wir hatten noch eine zustzliche Vorspeise - wer bin ich, dass ich Hummus widerstnde!
Extrawnsche in Sachen no bread, no milk waren kein Problem, die Speisen, die dann kamen waren interessant gewrzt, leicht suerlich mitunter, nussig und mit gutem l angereichert.

Finally! Soon dubu that doesn't require me having to drive down to Chinatown!

I have dined in and ordered take-out from K-bop and every time the food has been delicious and consistent. Our orders vary but generally soon dubu (spicy tofu soup) and bibimbop (rice bowl with vegetables and meat) are always staple items.

Dining in, the service is very good and I love that they stay open late! It's a perfect on-the-way home stop for comfort Korean food.

Located on the SW corner or Stephanie and Horizon Ridge. Good parking and plenty of gas pumps.

Always clean and never too busy. They area is well lit at night and feels safe.

Regular Gas 10/15/12 $3.739 per gallon

The mini mart has all the normal stuff and is always clean when I go in to grab something.

Staff for some reason almost every time I stop in is either smoking outside or seem a little disinterested but whatever. 

I'm not trying to date them, I just want some cheap gas, a drink and to get my butt outta there!

train

URRKN stands for Underground Railroad Rescue Kitty Network and was started by Tina LaBlanc in Oct of 2011.  It's a way of transporting kitties from shelters, foster homes and temporary homes to their "forever homes".

It's basically a series of wonderful volunteers that are willing to transport cats from one place to another.  One long trips each volunteer will drive whatever distance they feel comfortable and then meet another volunteer at a prearranged location.

On a long trip it might be many volunteers that selflessly give their time and transportation to help the kitty get to it's finally destination.  A person waiting for the kitty can actually keep track on the progress as the cat travels on it's "love train".

We recently adopted a kitty from Florida that had to be transported to Rhode Island.  We contacted URRKN and volunteers were quickly arranged so our kitty, Gersemi, arrived to us quickly and in great health and spirits.

There is no charge for this incredible service but of course donations are accepted.  It all depends on the kindness and generosity of strangers who anonymously do good without asking for anything but a simple thank you.

The volunteers of the URRKN along with Tina LaBlanc, are doing great deeds in a quiet way.  Such acts of kindness for no other reason but to be kind are wonderful and rare things that should never be taken for granted.

This bar is AMAZING! Head over now before the cancer of East Fremont metastasizes past 10th street and ruins it!!

When these guys reopened the historic Atomic Liquors (a/k/a the Oldest Bar in Vegas TM), they had a choice. They could class it up and serve pretentious drinks at exorbitant prices -- and maybe even install a velvet rope out front, in keeping with the new East Fremont vibe.

Instead, to their EVERLASTING credit, they reopened the Atomic as a solidly unpretentious, irony-free dive bar. They even kept the sparkling popcorn ceilings!! 

I went on opening night, when the place was slammed. The bouncer at the door was a cherubic-faced sweetie (!!!! I've NEVER met such a nice bouncer), the bartendress served me immediately, despite the crowd...and the best part was, I got two drinks for $8. This will be my go-to bar from this point on! 

FIVE THUMBS UP!!! (Us atomic fallout victims have extra thumbs, don't ya know...)

***Ciao Ciao's gelato is pretty good but also very overpriced (even for Las Vegas)***

Ciao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.

Service was quick and pleasant.

Pricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).

Ciao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.

The Forum Shops and Caesars offer complimentary parking (via valet or self parking structure).

A group of us came here for breakfast and really enjoyed D'lish.

We ordered their drip coffee and some bagels and found everything tasty.  The coffee was strong and HOT! If water boils at 212F, then D'lish serves it at 210F LOL  What was great about it?  It wasn't over roasted and burnt like the Green Mermaid.  Actually the three of us enjoyed our conversation waiting for it to cool.

The bagels were another surprise.  Given the small space of D'lish's building, I would love to find out where the get them.  My suspicion would be NY Bagel on Scottsdale Road, up near Shea Blvd.  But no matter, they were very good and hit the spot.

We'll be back for lunch.

Ok here is the thing, I went back another time and it was good. 

About a month later we came late with our roomie. It was bar service only since it was late. 

The bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get our chips..


I watched him walk over to the chips and grab handfuls of chips with his bare hands. HE IS THE BARTENDER HANDLEING MONEY AND HE WAS JUST HOLDING A DIRTY RAG.

I asked him for a new batch that was "hand picked" he said it was all bare hand touched. 

I told him that was fine for the food preparers that dont handle fecal, infectious disease money!!

He acted like I was retard, I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good.

It wasnt aweful but it wasnt good as before, AT ALL!

Get it together over there


more like 2 and a half

P.S. If the owners read this, he needs to be schooled. I wish I knew his name, he may have had a mustache?

Once upon a time, in a city far, far from Cranberry Twp, two special little elfs stirred up flour and sugar and tons of chocolate together, (actually it was childhood friends Eileen Spitalny & David Karvetz) and founded Fairytale Brownies way back in 1992.  Since that day, many diet rules have been broken and many pounds have been gained.  The pecan brownies and pecan blondie's are to die for.  And the best (or is it the worst?) part is, you can order these things on-line!  Isn't that great??? I will never have to bake, again!!

OK so maybe I'm just a simple Scandanavian man, with an easily pleasable palette. But judging by other yelp reviews, my first FOI experience stands alone. I get a kick out of most Thai/Indian/Asian strip mall restaurants. The decor is pretty tacky. So, I tend to get my chow to go. I had the friendliest, most helpful lady guide me through the menu. We picked out a vindaloo, a tandoori, 2 orders of naan, some veggie fritters and a tikka masala. 
Vindaloo 2 stars
Tandoori 3 stars
Masala 5 stars
Fritters 0 stars ughhh 
Naan 5 stars
King Fisher Beer 10 stars...can I do that?
Service 5 stars
False ceiling with stains 1 star

Well, as they say in India, um, hmmm...I don't really know what they say in India. So, I settle for see you later yelpers!

One of my favorite Casino in the strip, this isn't as crowded as the other one.  The most important this one felt more classy and isn't smelly at all. Their interior design is heavy based butterfly, There's staff everywhere and had very helpful provided assist.  The time were were there also were offering $10 free-play slot.  They got many different kind of slot, included some heavy license one like Iron Man 3 and Avatar, never know there's a slot for that.

Everywhere in the Casino was clean and felt comfortable playing here, as with most casino.  They bring free drinks while you are playing here.  This one actually offer you alcohol drinks unlike most other just gave you water or juice.  I would definite come back to stay here and try their famous Buffet.  You can walk to Encore inside without stepping out the sun.  Their play club booth was near the entrance, unlike other casino is hidden some where in the casino floor.

The head  baker here is a bad  mutha--shut yo mouth!!! 
I was referred here by an unnamed source who decided they'd had enough of me and my so called diet and boy was this a diet buster
First off, the thing that impressed me out of nowhere was the tres leches. Usually buying tres leches from somewhere other than a Mexican bakery usually ends in a sugary wet disaster, but when they pulled it off, I knew we could be in business

The cream of the crop, at least to me were the mini pies. I always love eating pies by myself so making one smaller was only the next logical step, and I must say it almost brought a tear to my eye. Me and my food brother took bites out our pies and then gave each other that look that only a fellow secret food beast will understand. Needless to say those pies went off to the great bakery in the sky
Long story short, get here, eat some pastries then walk out like a boss

Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. 

I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)

"To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living."   Anthony Bourdain

This little shop has it all:  wood chips, charcoal, wine, beer, spices, BBQ sauce, all-natural dog treats, and many cuts of meats from all sorts of animals.  Truly living up to their shop name, it is meat and spirits galore [mainly meat though].  So on our recent excursion, I bought some andouille brats and jalapeo & cheese brats to grill up.  I wanted to grab a jar of sauerkraut but Mr. W. voted against it.  What a stick-in-the-mud! Anyways, after boiling the brats and tossing it on the grill, we feasted, and it was delicious --- especially the jalapeo one. This place is a bit pricier than your average vanilla supermarkets but that's the price you pay for freshness and quality. Next time, I'm getting me some steaks.

Walking into this shop makes me feel like a caveman.  All that meat and beer!  But then I realize I'm wearing heeled booties with jeggings and it stops me from chestbumping every guy I come across. Just kidding... I chestbump the ladies. *sassy hair flip*

I count my lucky stars that I am so fortunate to be able to finally eat at  by Jos Andrs.  It was a special occasion and we (surprisingly my husband included because he usually prefers cheap Chinese food over frou frou stuff) both thoroughly enjoyed the EXPERIENCE.  It was a precisely choreographed dance to put together these pieces of food, a play on textures, temperatures and flavors.  It was an experience with the art of food, and I'm not saying it with any disdain for snobbiness this time.  There were 24 morsels of delicious food - all incredibly creative.

The short and sweet version: Precision.  Perfectly choreographed and executed.  Juxtaposition of Flavors and Textures.  Adjectives that come to mind:  Fragrant.  Whimsical.  Airy.  Crunchy.  Ice Cold.  Salty and Sweet.  Warm.  Fluffy.  Umami.  Crumbly.

1.  Rebujito - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses.  
2.  Truffle Cotton Candy - whimsical, fluffy with the aroma of truffle.  
3.  Idiazabal "Macaron" - delightfully crunchy with a cheesy filling
4.  Apple "Brazo De Gitano" - Airy on the outside, creamy blue cheese "espuma" on the inside
5.  Seta Suprise - Creamy 'shrooms
6.  Nitro Almond Cup - NITROGEN cold (not just ice cold) and smooth on the outside, creamy/briny/salty caviar on the inside.
7.  Barquillo - crunchy shell, aromatic Truffle and anchovy foam
8.  Almejas Al Natural - spherical globules encased with the essence of oyster 
9.  Bocatade Bacalao - warm, buttery brioche, savory cod, umami-licious?
10. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - extra crispy chicken skin + foam
11. Cava Sangria - Pop!  globule of sangria 
12. Artichoke "Puree" with vanilla - creamy, mild, smooth
13. Lobster with Citrus & Jasmine - tender lobster with jasmine flavored air
14. Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham - globules of essence of chickpea and accents of ham
15. Turbot with Bone Marrow - salty/sweet/bitter combo with crispy bone marrow, turbo fish and coffee grinds
16. Lobe of Foie Gras - savory foie gras combined with fresh orange juice 
17. Secreto of Iberico Pork with Squid + Parsley Foam - tender, squid was a touch burnt I thought
18. Santa Gadea with Cotton Candy - "goat in sheep's clothing," goats milk with sweet cotton candy
19. Flan - creamy, light and airy
20. Pan con Chocolate - MY FAVORITE DESSERT OF THE NIGHT.  Crumbled frozen chocolate sorbet with cream, hints of saffron, crunchy sweet crystallized bread, and olive oil.  
21. "Arroz con Leche" - Another well played piece on texture, temperature and flavor
22. 25 second Bizcocho - fluffy cake with lemon cream
23. Air Chocolates - wow.  bitter chocolate and I usually really like dark chocolate 
24. Cocoa Paper with Dried Strawberry - airy light chocolate with tangy freeze dried strawberry bit

$ to Value Ratio:  4.75/5 Stars... This is definitely debatable (my mom may think it's a complete waste of money), but I rated it high because my experience was impeccable (service was top notch, ingredients were top notch)
Yummy Factor: 5/5 Stars
Texture Satisfaction: 5/5 Stars
Average stars: 4.92 Stars

We were guest 4999 and 5000!  =)

Ahhhh....Jenny's. Good ole Jenny's. Gay as gay can be. Depending on when you are there of course. I've found myself at Jenny's post bar rush stuffing my pie hole with a club sandwich, fries and many glasses of Coca Cola. 

Then there's the late morning, early afternoon call from friends who want to gather at Jenny's, eat greasy food to soak up the previous evening's booze and dish about who fell down, who got arrested and who will end up on dirty.com! Of course, we all secretly hope it is us!

I love diner waitresses. They get it. They have the patience of a saint and the sass and swagger of a sailor. All the while delivering my hot plate of eggs, shredded hash browns (can you say Ore Ida!?), various meats and extra butter on the toast please. God bless 'em. God bless them all! 

So Jenny's has a place in our hearts. Not on Valentine's Day. Not on the books for New Year's Eve. But, dayum, if I'm not grateful to have you Jenny on that famous CenPho corner, we call 7th Street and Camelback.

I had no idea what to expect as I pulled up to the Gangplank office just before noon today... 

Perhaps a bunch of techy computer nerds that didn't speak my language?  That was my fear.

But I was pleasantly surprised - everyone was warm and welcoming and although they may speak in a crazy tech language to each other, I was able to communicate amongst the group just fine. 

As the other reviews state that came before this one, Gangplank is an open workspace that anyone is welcome to pop in on... they have weekly events and presentations, such as the brown bag lunch that I presented at today.  I have a feeling if Gangplank were not located all the way in Chandler, I'd be a regular - but I do plan on making the drive again soon for sure.

The people that work from Gangplank seem like the 'people to know' if you are looking for an awesome local techy community that is creative, smart, and fun. Check it out for yourself... maybe i'll see you there!

The cupcakes are decent but the kids working there have run me off for good. During my last visit the store was full of teenagers, friends of the kids working there. And while I'm paying $45 for a dozen cupcakes, the employees were handing out freebies to the other kids in the store without any regard for how rude they were being to their paying customers. I understand they have the right to give away anything they want to anyone they want, but they were more interested in impressing their friends than paying attention to the real customers.

My wife and I frequent the mall quite a bit and stop in regularly but I doubt we'll be back in anytime soon if we see the same kids working the store.

Loved my stay! 

My aunt and my uncle have a timeshare, and the Hiltons on the strip were booked, so we ended up here at the one by the Convention Center. It was only about 5 minute drive to the strip, it was quiet and very comfortable. 

We were on the 11th floor in adjoining rooms and it was super comfy! One room had a full kitchen, big frig, dishwasher, dining table, washer and dryer, couches and TV, a separate bedroom and restroom. 
The other room, which i was in, had a huge, very comfortable soft bed, a tv, couch, table, dresser, closet, kitchenette with small fridge and a bathroom. Bathroom had a tub and nice oversized showerhead for shower. 

The only things that i would note that was negative was the doors inside the rooms got stuck. The bathroom door would not close correctly and would made a horrid loud sound every time you tried to get out. The middle door adjoining the rooms got stuck too. 

Other than that,  if you are staying for more than a weekend, this place is really clean and comfortable!

So Jamie and I were walking on the Strip right after seeing Cher at Caesar's Palace. Yes, Cher....all 63 years of her and not an ounce of fat on her. If she could back ti-yummm...ti-yummmmm. Anyway, amid the drunken youngsters drinking the bong-shaped decanters of margaritas, we suddenly heard the ghostly voice of Celine Dion screeching to us that her heart will go on. My God, isn't she back in Montreal yet? I avoided Vegas for six years so I wouldn't have to hear that pompous voice of hers. 

Alas, it was the sound system at the Fountains of Bellagio playing her overplayed song as the waters danced to the bombast. Gratefully, it was the very end we had to hear, so we waited patiently for the next show in fifteen minutes. This time, it was Lee Greenwood singing his tribute to Reaganomics - "God Bless the USA" - and you can see how those policies have brought us today to near financial ruin. Regardless, the fountains are quite a sight, especially at night with all the lights adding yet another dimension.

Apparently, there are three types of nozzles used to make the special effects - oarsmen (jets with a full range of spherical motion); shooters (which shoot water upwards); and super shooters (which send the water up as high as 250 feet in the air). Gee, that sounds like one of the sex shows that those guys are selling with those cards that they pluck and snap as you pass by. The whole extravaganza lasts about three to four minutes, and no worry if you miss one as another show comes in fifteen to thirty minutes depending on the time of day. It's quite a dazzler, and your only other free option is watching the Sirens of T.I. (Treasure Island). I am so not in that target audience.

Oh yeah, here's my video of that waterworks show...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8ehU_hPD5E

i wont go here ever again even if I'm dying. 

Long story short I came here last Saturday night because my leg had gotten run over by a car and I was in sever pain. I knew nothing was broken but I was worried about blood clots or tissue/muscle damage so to be on the safe side I wanted to be checked out. The ER was completely empty which was nice but now i know why. Once in a ER room I was seen by about 6 different people and every time I told them the situation how my leg was run over they each started laughing and the doctor even had the audacity to comment on my hair color (it being blonde) I have never felt so disrespected in my life and he wouldn't even show me my test results from my cat scan and xrays. So now I'm stuck with a $3,000 bill and I have nothing to show for it. He wouldn't even prescribe me ibuprofen for the pain. I will never return

ode to a Chilaquiles.

so i ate some Chilaquiles at Pepe's the other morning. not ever having Chilaquiles before i was not sure if my Chilaquiles was good or great, but the Chilaquiles was good to me. very tasty Chilaquiles that is. i had my Chilaquiles with hard fried eggs because i'm not a fan of runny yoke. my Chilaquiles egg was only 85% to my requested hard fried, resulting in a missing star. tho my Chilaquiles was very good. my Chilaquiles was made with a tomatoes salsa texture of sauce..watery in a way..but not knowing how Chilaquiles should look..i thought it was good. Chilaquiles.

the tortilla chips are also good. and i kinda liked the squeeze bottles. cause i just squeeze it onto a chip and put it in my mouth. tasty salsas..i squirted a bunch onto my Chilaquiles egg that wasn't fried enough..so i didn't notice the runny texture. Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles. the beans with my Chilaquiles had white cheese on them, alot of mexican restuarants use a handful of yellow cheese so i was impressed..it wasn't crumble queso-fresco..but it was still tasty with my Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles.


ok i think i have used Chilaquiles eighteen times now..umm ok nineteen times...so to finish off with an even twenty...Chilaquiles. yummm. ohh btw they take bank cards now.

A hands down must see attraction. The first time I saw it in 2006 they played My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. It was so beautiful I almost cried! The strip side offers the best views in my opinion. 

The fountains are set in a 9 acre manmade lake.  They incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights. It is estimated that the fountains cost $75 million to build. The fountains were created by WET, a design firm specializing in inventive fountains and architectural water features.

Here are the fountain show times: 

Monday - Friday 
3:00 PM. - 8:00 PM. 
show every 1/2 hour 
8:00 PM. - 12:00 AM. 
show every 15 minutes 

Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays 
12:00 PM. - 8:00 PM. 
show every 1/2 hour

A plate of fancy desserts, a plate of carved meats & BBQ, while slurping a bowl of beef pho and tonkotsu ramen. Don't. f*ck. up. this. rotation.

Excited to see that Ceasars Palace was finally opening the doors of its highly anticipated $7 million buffet, Vegas buffets are very similar to one another (all equipped with seafood, carving station, fancy dessert station, etc). Generally, new buffets start off very well, so we jumped to try this before it begins to spiral down in quality (all buffets eventually do this).

Bacchanal seems to have adapted a lot of Wicked Spoon ideas like the brilliantly idiotic concept of individually plating items in dishes/pots/pans/mini-deep fryers so that items do not fit on your existing buffet plate 
(Why does fancy plating mean that we have to further frequently pace back and forth for more food?)
But, all in all, the food at Bacchanal is a solid buffet competitor to Wynn, Cosmo, & Bellagio.

The perfect time to go to a Vegas buffet is right before lunch ends (2:30).  
(Props to Justin Y.)
That way:
1. You avoid peak rush hours and the death line wrapped around the corner. 
2. You pay for the lunch price, while dinner items are new and slowly filter in at stations. I.E Crab legs were were not offered for lunch, but appeared later during our meal
3. Going out at night? Luckily for you, you had a late lunch/early dinner so you will feel like less of a whale in that tight dress.


Bacchanal Back-anal jokes aside, this place is recommended

The first thought that flashed through my head was another new "Pipster" inspired corporate rollout complete with ass-breaking uncomfortable communal style tables and Jelly Jars.  Jelly Jars, the Kim Kardashian sort of popular official gentrification bar glassware and lunchroom like seating...heavy sigh!

My second thought, RUFKM!!!  If I'm going to order a $19 margarita I want gold flecked tequila slowly dribbled into my mouth by a libation slave.  I was pretty convinced that that was not going to happen, since I couldn't even get a glass of water, so I insulted my palate with a Boone's Farmish tasting sangria that had a few slices of orange floating in it like a dead goldfish.

My third thought, WTF!!!   I could have gotten a better meal at a Del Taco drive thru without the maybe I should refinance my house prices!!!  

Pollo al Horno - dry and bland 
Chicken Burrito - dry with a undefinable overabundance of a spice that made it close to inedible
2 Chicken Enchiladas with Mole - more dry chicken, the mole sauce tasted like a cinnamon paste, dreadful!
Communal rice & beans - Meh

We were ironically glad about the kid sized portions, because all our meals ranged from poor to fair at best.

My fourth thought, Really!!!  Haphazard, inconsistent and totally inattentive service, no water, no chips, no follow up.

My final thoughts, get me the heck outta here and never ever again.

The star is only because the neon monkey was cute

This is one of the best vista points around. It is THE BEST vista point for lost wages IMHO. So what if it is 16 or 18 bucks to go up top if you are not staying at stratosphere... No where else can view everything happening so easily and take it all in. 

You can see the North Las Vegas Race Track... Lake mead in the distance... The air traffic buzzing into and out of the airport like bees to a hive... or the Strip. The times I have been to the top of the Stratosphere, I have wanted to, but didnt take a trip on the rides (someday I will). There are three; one a roller coaster, one a bouncer, and I cant remember what the third is... but all seem like fun when you are over 1000 feet up.

PRO TIP: If you are staying at Stratosphere, you get a free trip up to the top of the tower!

There is also a restaurant up at the top which I want to try someday. I bet it is a romantic view kind of place even if it is not romantic in nature. 

I also happen to love the view of the mountains and how the sun glints off of them here n there, let alone how they change hue depending on the sunlight as well. 

So if you couldnt tell, this is one of my favorite places/activities to go to while in Vegas.

Someone recently asked me what I thought of Fort McDowell Casino. 

Bleccch!  Was my first thoughts. My second was bring a gas mask.  Yes, it's that bad.  It's like you're back in the 1960s with the blue smoke haze.  

Over the years I attended conferences in LVS, Atlantic City, London, et cetera. This Casino is sadly the bottom rung and I'm up over $200 here on the one dollar slots!

The only Casino that may be in the same poor state of condition would be the Cliff Castle Casino in Camp Verde.  But that one is more amusement park with slots, then a Casino.  They also have a bowling alley, Kid Quest and a bunch of other stuff going on.  BTW, their Storyteller's Steakhouse isn't bad.

So why come here, when you have a Four Star experience at Talking Stick neaby? Looking at the other Yelp'ers who have given Fort McDowell Casino One and Two Stars, I believe Andrea nailed it.  "This place is beyond gross. It's sad and pathetic, with sad and pathetic people gambling away money they clearly cannot afford to gamble away. "  Of course Monique summed it up nicely, too. LOL

So, One Star "Eek! Methinks not."

Swanky Anglicised Cantonese served in a modern, chic Asian inspired dining space.  The food; the dog's bollocks.  Excellent.  Unfortunately combine it's Michelin one star status in London with the typical markup on anything Asian on the Strip, the prices will make you ask if they are taking the piss and leave you gobsmacked. (OK enough British slang).

Not your neighborhood Chinese.  You won't find sweet sour here.  Dishes are individual courses.  Some are meant to be shared, others not.  

On this evening, without looking at the menu, asked the server to just bring our party, some of the best dishes.  The result:

Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  

Braised abalone with black truffles.  Soft, tender, impregnated by the sweetness of Chinese wine, the earthy flavor of the truffle the aroma enhances the sweetness of the abalone.  

Peking duck with caviar.  Not the classic Peking duck (this one has some breast meat attached) but wow, soft pancake, pungent scallion and snappy cucumber, crisp duck skin and to top it off, caviar whose oceanic flavor adds an incredible, unexpected complexity. 

A delicate, crisp quail with Chinese five spice and chili sauce, a perfectly roasted Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey whose sweet but bitter notes brings out the natural flavor of the fish, an nontraditional fried and steamed dim sum platter whose freshness, taste, and quality, will put all but the best to shame rounded out the meal.

Service is very efficient and friendly.  The wine list, well chosen.  Typical Vegas resort prices. 

So, $245 for Peking duck, $188 per order of abalone, worth it?  Elevated to this level, bloody well right.

I just went into the MAC store today because I lost my favorite lip gloss (maybe it fell underneath my car seat?) anyway the gal who greeted me was very helpful.  Luckily there was a card on me so my last purchase was recorded.  She was able to find the color of my lost lip gloss.  She also told me that a percentage of the sale of this particular gloss goes to help Aids.  Interesting. I bought two lip glosses. I'm happy the store isn't far from where I work in case I lose another lip gloss.

New from Tom Colicchio, innovator of New American cuisine, old breeds of cows cooked over the oldest cooking method known, open fire.  Oh and it's bloody good.  

Every dish has a component that is either cooked over an open flame, or smoked.  Not your backyard griller where everything has the same bitter, smoky aroma and flavor forcing you to reach for BBQ sauce.   At Heritage Steak each dish is prepared as a standalone, incorporating the appropriate type of cooking and intensity.  Each has its own complementing or contrasting element to the smoky, bitterness.

Examples, for starters, the hamachi sashimi topped with intensely smoked crme fraiche, beets, cucumber, caviar and a bit of lemon puree.  Acidity and bitterness work together to bring out the sweet flavor of the fish.  The wood roasted peaches with Iberico ham and arugula salad; lets just say the sweet bitterness of the peaches pickups the earthy, musky tasty of the ham, beautiful.  Finally the soy chili glazed skewers of squab and duck breast.  Hawaii yeeps, teriyaki pigeon and duck; what's not to love!   Earthy soy glaze, charred bitterness, blistered skin, rare throughout.  Perfect with it's brightly herbaceous and peppery watercress, cilantro and basil salad.

Steaks.  Two types.  USDA Prime and the Heritage. 

Excessive food trivia:  Heritage breeds of cattle were developed to be reared in specific climates versus today's breeding that focuses on highest yield.  All raised without the use of antibiotics and hormones.   The result different climate, different flavors. 

All steaks are very well trimmed, seared, and properly cooked.  A strong grilled flavor permeates the entire cut (no oven or pan roasting to finish).  The bone in rib eye and porterhouse are denser with more chew than the standard USDA Prime.  Both have a more mineral flavor similar to grass fed beef.  Beefier.  Order one of the regular USDA Prime cuts along side the heritage cuts, the difference will amaze you.

Warm, contemporary interior in the atrium of the Mirage.  Well trained, confident staff for a new restaurant. 

Excellent wine list focusing on American producers.  Outstanding selection of brown libations.  Vegas resort prices.

The new old.  Maybe old made new.  In either case, Heritage steak delivers.  A welcome addition to the Vegas food scene.

After seeing the touring production of Jersey Boys once or twice (or a lot of times), it was a must-do on a recent trip to Vegas.  

Of course the show revolves around the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  You get the full biography of how the band came together, and the ups and downs that went along with the group through the years.  The story is told both through narrative and song, making for an entertaining and interactive experience.

Although Frankie is the star, the real driver of the story is Tommy DeVito, played brilliantly by Deven May.  You'll have to see the show for yourself to see why he's truly the lead character.  No spoilers here.

The show is currently being held at Paris, and the theater and lobby area are both spacious and comfortable.  So even if you don't think you're a Frankie Valli fan (didn't think I was the first time I went), it's definitely worth seeing.

[REVIEW FROM THE ROAD]

Oh my god.  (Rental) Trucker Heaven!

SITREP

Shift-change, and I'm riding shotgun once again, so I can say what an awesome travel-center I found Petrol to be.

THE SET-UP

We got gas, but I went inside to buy a small cooler size of ice.  Pedro of Petrol, "you got your own container - and keeping things green with a reduced carbon footprint - so get the ice you need!" - and so I did!

THE AMENITIES

Perhaps it was because we were just outside Vegas, or perhaps because we were traveling that stretch of I-15 to Salt Lake City with a kicked-up truckers' presence, but dam if this place doesn't bring tons of services:

* Private Shower stalls you can use;
* A Full Washer & Dryer Center;
* An Arcade Center;
* A Slot Machine Center;
* A Large Swanky Diner; and,
* Of course, the Drink & Munchie Center

Pretty pretty impressive for what basically amounts to a 1st Class Gas Station / Truck Stop.

THE LOWDOWN

Great Stop for unexpected Munchie fun!

Hana has without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had. I was blown away at how good it was. The Salmon Sashimi was so fresh and delicious! Every roll we ordered was just mouth watering goodness. Only complaint is that the Edamame is served cold, I've never been a fan of that. Not even a big deal.

Had the worst customer service experience ever at Polished. Polished sent out a groupon type coupon (spend $X, get $X worth of service), I called and made an appointment. When I arrived for my appointment, the tech I requested was running behind. Instead of going to a different tech, I rescheduled, since I had already waited 20 minutes and was on a tight schedule myself. When I came on that day Wes, the owner, would not honor my coupon! I was very upset as this was their mistake! When I told Wes I was going to leave a Yelp review, he said "Go ahead! Obliviously our business isn't hurting!" 

Well, Wes, judging by the constant coupons you are now sending out - your business is hurting. Maybe the way you treat your customers, and the way you mistreat and yell at nail techs in front of customers, is coming back to haunt you. 

I HIGHLY suggest Diamond Nails just a block down on Rainbow. Same side of the street. AMAZING services all around.

Even though this would pretty much be a one and done for anyone living in Las Vegas, I highly recommend checking out the Neon Museum.  Having the lights on definitely added awesome effect to the signs for the 7:30pm tour.  My wife and I both agreed this was much better to see at night.

Our tour guide, April, was chockful of great information.  She really enhanced what would have been a 10-15 minute walkthrough sans guide to an hour tour full of history and fun stories.  That alone made it well worth the locals admission of $22.  Some of my favorite signs included Sassy Sally's, the humungous Treasure Island skull, the H tile board of the Horseshoe and the creepy at night looking Jackpot Motel sign.

Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. 

Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. 

I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? 

The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. 

The rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. 

The place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.

Leave it to me to go to Las Vegas - a Foodie Mecca - and order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Granted, this sandwich was ordered while suffering from a food hangover from a fancy dinner tthe night before AND 6 am nachos earlier that morning, but work with me here and see me for the rough & tough PB&J (not P & BJ) gal that I be.

$3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia & peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.  Instead, I left with almost six dollars to blow on the wheel-of-fortune slot machines that call my name in their sweet, sweet way.

The $3.95 special was off the Kid's Menu, but I batted my eyelashes in an epileptic way that I haven't done since I ran a red light during my driving test and really, really, REALLY needed my license.

Two PB&Js later, Lindsey and I headed up to our room to prepare for another chaotic evening. 

Unpretentious + Inexpensive = 4 peanut butter & jelly-filled stars

Hands Down The Most Enjoyable Cirque Experience EVER!!!

If you're a fan of MJ and all his amazing work, this show is a Must See!

From the very start of the show to the very end, the performers had the audience engaged with hands clapping and toes tappin' 
Honestly, even if you have two left feet, you will feel compelled to get up and dance! 
The vibe of the entire show is lighthearted yet thoughtful to MJ's extensive body of work. It embodied the best of MJ and his dedication to music, children and equality.  

I truly enjoyed this show on so many levels and I'm not even a huge MJ fan.

Now, be warned, if you're a Cirque Du Soleil purist looking for the obligatory acrobats this show may not be for you. However, if you love a high energy, creative and unique experience, "One" will not disappoint! 

I guarantee you will leave the show feeling gooooood!

Happy Times!

Vegetarian?  Here's a pickle.  This is the carnivore's domain.

Note:  Everything I know about BBQ, I learned on TV.  I've been to Memphis, Kansas City, and Dallas and never had a lick of the stuff.  Even better, growing up in Hawaii, we boiled our ribs before grilling them.  I'm quite the expert.  But...

The wafting aroma of sweet hickory smoke.  The earthy, mild spice rub that has deeply penetrated the proteins; a moist, beefy rib with tender sinew and rendered fat;  fall off the bone baby backs; "suckably" delicious cartilage of toothsome spareribs, and glistening slices of brisket.  The acrid, bitterness of the smoke ring in strong contrast to the almost sweet meat.   Food porn!

The sauce has a good vinegar kick that helps to cut the one dimensional flavor and cloying, richness that becomes more difficult to take the more you eat and the colder it gets.  

Their signature, bigger than any human's mouth, stuff falling out, BBQ sauce on your face "outlaw" burger is good eats.  Brisket, sauteed onions, peppers, fried onion strips, slaw, veg, cheese and a chipolte aioli; what's not to love?

Remaining menu items less successful.  The breaded catfish and shrimp are both overcooked and rubbery.  The smoked meatloaf, excessively smoky and bitter.  Deep fried sides often oily with one exception, the outstanding cream corn nuggets.  Crispy on the outside, rich creamy corn goodness on the inside.

Prices are very reasonable for the quantity.  The $24.99 AYCE a winner; anything on the menu, one price.

The worthy indulgence is not without cost.  Suffice it to say, remember waking up from a drunken stupor after having smoked your first cigar?  All the mouthwash in the world...

Love the SLS.  Period.  Wonderful service, wonderful restaurants, and wonderful pool.  It's a boutique, not a monstrosity.  Just what I want from a Vegas hotel.  What doesn't it have?  A great casino, and a little far down the strip so you are forced to drive, taxi, or monorail out.

#1 - Get here while it's affordable.  Whether you use Travelocity.com (like I did), hotels.com, or book direct -- there is amazing deals to be had right now.  On average, $139/night.  Again, amazing.

#2 - Restaurants.  Whether you dine at Cleo, Bazaar Meat, Katsuya, or casual dining spots like the SLS Buffet, Griddle Caf, 800 Degrees, Umami -- all are beyond great experiences.  Less so: Perq the coffee spot (it's okay), and Ku Noodle (very casual, has shu mai but not potstickers).

#3 - Service.  Wonderful and friendly, it was warm and extra nice for the moment I arrived.  Kudos.

#4 - Pool.  Cabanas are pricey, so I was able to get a soft and cushiony bed just inside the pool.  Cool music with outstanding looking pool hostesses and bartenders created a relaxing vibe that was also titillating.

#5 - Rooms.  The hallways are definitely hip near gothic, and the rooms were elegant and modern.  Lots of mirrors.  Ooh la la.

Overall, I loved my 3 night stay.

An initial good sign of any business is proper, friendly and enthusiastic phone answering skills. Budget delivered. Another good sign is the person pronouncing your name correctly. "Yes Thomas how can I help you?"...as oppossed to "Yes Tom how cany I help you?" I totally don't care you called me Tom, hell, you can call me Nancy Drew for all I care, but it shows you are LISTENING! A lost skill, don't ya think? I gave Joe my request. Which was pretty unique. I needed decals applied to a tinted window on my patio. Something to spice it up. We tried ourselves and those little decals bubbled more than a flapjack on a hot griddle in Atlanta in Julyyyy! I've never been to Atlanta or referred to pancakes as flapjacks. Something I just channeled so it seems. The work, by Jeremy was excellent. The follow up by Joe and his wife, visiting my establishment was unsurpassed. And greatly appreciated. So look for the good signs in any company. Politeness. Good work. Follow through. It happened to me. It will happen to you with Budget Signs.

-10 stars!

We heard this genleman's club was amazing and the biggest in the world so we decided to stop by prior to going to a nightclub. 

Um, THEY REFUSED TO LET US IN(3 females)! lol..it was hilarious. 
First, they told us that we couldn't see the women dance and that we must watch the men's show. We challenged them and they eventually said that because we had no guys in our party, we couldn't watch the girls dance. What sense does that make?

Coincidentally, a group of guys that we met earlier that day showed up as we were trying to get in and we tried to walk in with them, but they STILL refused to let us in. The bouncer said "Ladies, I don't care what you do, You're not getting in here!"

Although we were dressed for the club, we didnt look sluty or anything. We couldn't believe it! I have NO IDEA why they would send a car to our hotel to pick us up, and then refuse to let us in....

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

What is not to really like about this place?
Nothing that I can see.
It is a great place to come to ,if you live in the Valley, or anywhere else in the world.
 It is as great as any casino resort in Vegas.
 I think we are lucky to have it here close by.
The rooms are nice, there is covered parking. Great pools, nice grounds.
 The Buffett is one of the nicest around.
Nice place for out of town visitors to stay as well.
A t in my book.

Loved this! How many offices would you actually take a tour of?

Say what you want about the Downtown Project, Zappos itself is a company I would love to work for. If you have ever (or are currently) working in a shite office for a company that makes you feel like you're just a statistic, than you should check out the culture here at Zappos. From the tour alone, I learned about the transparent corporate ladder, saw open workstations, casual dress, Batista's, free food, supplemented food, 'quiet floors', outdoor areas and a life coach. A LIFE COACH. If that's not caring, I'm not sure what is. 

Seriously, check this place out. It's really great to see a company investing in its own employees once in a while.

This Wi-Fi cafe is a popular local hangout with a large and spacious interior and lots of outlets for laptops. The vibe is hipsterish with a local following, and the norms include busy foot traffic and people socializing and studying at every turn. They usually roast their beans in the middle of the day, so the deep coffee aroma can be very enticing before you step inside. I'm usually here with my laptop, and the convenience of parking in the back has allowed me to come here for casual and important meetings.

I had a small cup of Pilar ($4) that came from Guatemala with a crisp and airy consistency but a little bitter, chalky, and heavy on the finish. The added soymilk did not dissolve easily, prompting me to wish that they had handcrafted along with the pour over. The price was higher than Blue Bottle or Philz, so naturally I had to expect more from this drip.

I also tried a large cup of Soy Latte ($5) with Borbollon, a Salvadoran bean that tasted smooth, silky, complex, and easy at the finish. The soy consistency was creamy and not watery like some other places. I prefer the Latte than the pour over.

Service was friendly, responsive, and fairly consistent on every visit. Despite its popularity, their quality still a step behind some of the better handcrafted coffee places. A good place for studying and Yelping, I hope to eventually check out their downtown location.

Three Square has to be in my top 3 favorite charities in Las Vegas. Their mission is simple, feed local families in need. At school, at home, at work, on weekends... Three Square is there to help feed members of the community. They are savvy enough to throw some great event while fund raising, so check out their website for upcoming events. Also take a look at the volunteer schedule. There are opportunities almost every day and it's an easy process to get a group signed up for a day of volunteering. The Yelp volunteer day was on a Thursday morning and we ended up packing weekend bags of food for children. It was an easy gig (there were children and seniors helping out) and overall we packed over 3200 weekend meals in about 2 hours. Not into volunteering? That's OK. This is one charity where your money is well spent if you feel like donating some green bills.

The Arizona Railway Museum is a fun afternoon for kids all ages.  That includes those who ask for Senior Citizens discounts!

If you have ever been to other railway museums like Union Illinois, the setup here at Arizona Railway Museum is similar, though more modest. They have a very large collection of rolling stock. Along with one of the largest Union Pacific fleets outside of a UP's train yard. It's a very impressive and kids get to have an up close, hands on experience!

As I mentioned in my Yelp Tip, admission is a reasonable $2.00 and they're only opened on weekends, from Noon until 4:00 pm. The gift store is also well stocked with train magazines, train whistles, old time engineer hats and other collectibles. 

What's really nice are all the enthusiasts who volunteer here who are willing to share their love for trains, along with the history of railroading. 

When you are done, plan to stop at Roy's Train World. http://www.yelp.com/biz/roys-train-world-mesa#hrid:hwZIL_Nby6LbKvw6paeUQw  It's just a few short miles up the road, at 1033 S Country Club Drive in Mesa. They carry various HO, O and N gauge models of everything you'll see here 

BTW, don't forget to bring your camera.

Enjoy!

Retro chic from the bygone era of American classic films collides with reinvented American cuisine to create an interesting; ummm unique; ok, different, dining adventure.

The food sounds familiar but the updated approach to their preparation is not.  Sometimes, grandmas recipes can be improved upon but sometimes its best to leave a classic alone.

The seared foie with a vanilla French toast and cherry chutney is perfectly balanced and delicious.  Use the toast to mop up the foie fat and wow, the flavors are sublime.  Successful reinvention!  Then there is the steak tartare with a lemon crme fraiche and an olive tepenade that mask the raw beef flavor and instead heighten the metallic flavor. Eek.

For mains, top props to the fried free range chicken drizzled with a honey-sherry glaze.  Juicy, crispy, and a finger licking good sweet / acidic glaze.  The crispy Korean style pork belly is OK.  The accompanying kimchee fried rice is not.  Flat flavor and oily.

Finally, the steaks, the servers claim their prime but they are definitely not top prime or well aged.  A little tough.  A little lacking in beefy goodness. 

Service is very good.

Nice selection of wines.  The 50 under $50 list is well chosen and offers some good value.  The Captains List has some great finds if you are willing to look but the lack of organization and obscene overpricing of top wines make it hard for any connoisseur to take seriously ('00 Mouton $2900 [$1200 over retail], '00 Lafite $5800 [$3300 over retail]).

The Barrymore fills the void, providing a Strip like, exclusive dining experience without the Strip prices or hassle.  Is it worth it?  That's for you to decide.

Long over due review.

I don't dance 
I don't care for Country music 
I don't like hardcore Hip Hop
I don't like long lines for the bar 
I don't like small drink cups
I don't like bad karaoke
I don't like MILFS dancing to old 80's tunes (actually this can be ok)

BUT for some damn reason every time I come here I get drunk, damn drunk, on those cheap ass, small cups of rum and cokes that are gone by the time you get to the font of the line. At least you can sing like the other retards, or dance a 2 step,while you wait. On the other side you can lean like a Chollo, Just watch out for his Ho. They don't like drunk white boys, we belong with the milfs dancing to ABBA in the 80's room. 

This place is crazy and is is what you make it. If you had a bad time go to another room and try something new.

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

$170 for a ticket right smack at the center of the lower section less than 24 hours before the show's sold-out performance.  Yes, I was very lucky, and the show was worth every penny.

I think the best way to describe the show is with the use of adjectives:

amazing
beautiful
colorful
daring
fantastic - O (thanks Luis C!)
magical
magnificent
O-mazing (thanks Earl G!)
stunning

Oh, who am I kidding?  Janice C. is absolutely right.  There are no words to describe the grace and beauty of this show.  You'll just have to check it out the next time you're in Las Vegas.  Highly recommended, I left the theatre that night in complete awe!

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

One of our routines after a movie, is to come here for a "le petit dessert".

It also works before the movie as well.  LOL.  It all depends if we're doing Reverse HH next door at Pita Jungle.

There are a few G Spots in Scottsdale.  This one serves just gelato, or frozen milk as I like to think of it.  The one in Old Town has some great pizza.  

Several Yelp'er it seems, have used up their allotment of the word "Amazing' to describe the G Spot.  So I'll add delicious to the lexicon.  We had the Dark Chocolate and Salty Caramel last weekend, after seeing Zero Dark Thirty.

Go!  Enjoy!

I've heard they officially changed their name to Big Pile of Crap. 

I'm sorry. I know this is a discount store. I'm not expecting cappuccino and Evian while shopping, though it would be a lovely touch.  But could you sweep the floor? I mean you sell brooms for God's sake. 

I did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles. 

Really? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen, if I ever stop by again, I'll bring my Swiffer.

Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.

Estiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the "other" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?

Milos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.

Grilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.

Finally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.

Tip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.

Very good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.

A restaurant that has vastly improved with time.

Solid izakaya.  Good food, reasonable prices, with just the right amount of  culinary weirdness to remind you this is Vegas.

As a fellow yeep stated, "Kyara is either he poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza"  So true.  Dishes do not deliver the authenticity or finesse of Raku but nor do the prices.  A good thing for the izakaya noob.

For starters, top props to the spicy tuna dip served with rice crackers.  Clean tuna flavor without the cloying mayo.  Great textural contrast when eaten on the rice crackers.  Other sashimi dishes are less successful, swimming in sauces that quickly "cooks" the fish (ceviche) and overpowers the subtle fish flavors.  

Deep fried items deliver great flavor but do not order too many at once.  Maybe it was busy on my visits but the oil is not hot enough, so the food gets soggy fast.  Items with cheese; yes cheese, take on a very greasy, cloying mouth feel.  Not good eats. Stick to simple items.  The squid tentacles are absolutely delicious.  Ranging from tender to tough with a salty finish.  The gobo chips simple and earthy.

Finally, skewered and grilled items are all very good and averaging $2 a skewer, dirt cheap.  Chicken and pork options moist, veg barely cooked exuding freshness, both with a delicious hibachi char.  Great tasting marinades and sauces that give them all a flavor punch deserving of any beer.  The enoki clusters wrapped in bacon is a must try. 

Special note:  Yamaimo is offered in many preparations on the menu.  If you have never tried it before, it is very challenging texturally.  Slimy and starchy.  You either like it or you don't.  Just sayin.

Friendly and efficient service.  Very reasonable prices.

This is your typical Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen gas station location, but serving up some decent chicken. 

There isn't a great many free standing Popeye's locations here in the Valley, while it's former corporate sister Church's, seem to have nothing but free standing places. 

I have a friend who use to own two franchises in the Midwest back in the day. He and everyone who ever met Popeye's founder, Al Copeland thought the world of him. Copeland had this NOLA style, Horatio Alger story. Rags to riches, back to rags... well, not quite.  But in the end, Copland had enough to leave a bunch of money to LSU.  Not bad for a high school dropout.

The secret, as most Popeye aficionados will tell you, is to come here when they are running special. Like Tuesdays, when the special is 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and a drink for $3.99. Otherwise, it can be just as expensive as the Colonels' place. But Popeye's chicken is better!  

Oh, how I miss the MSG laced Cajun Sparkle.  It was better than coffee. LOL. Three Stars, A-Okay.

The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.

Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.

The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites taient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!

Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".

I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!

I really hate to do this downgrade, but I have to for the sake of all those that love good beer and some sort of decent service.

After my fourth visit, I'll likely refrain from stopping in to  WOB for quite some time. 15 minutes at a table, and 10 at the bar, and still no one would talk to us to take our orders and money. Even after trying to flag folks down at the bar and table, my friends and I were totally ignored. Sure, they have a phenomenal selection of beer, but that doesn't do me a bit of good if no one will take my order. The employees were too busy yucking it up with each other to pay us any mind at all.

Hopefully they'll educate their employees here pretty soon. I would love to spend money here, but they have to want to take it, first.

My search for a new nail salon is OVER!! Thank goodness almighty, I've found the place for me! Okay, the decor isn't all ghetto like Nails Too and it isn't all pretty and sleek like Pleasant Nails. It's juuuust right! 

for under $40 I get my pedi on (with an extra sea salt scrub) AND my fills with polish. I love my polish, I'm going through a very simple and pink nail polish phase. 

The pedis are awesome with the technicians taking extra care to get all the dead skin off (gross I know) and there's plenty of magazines and of course a tv that's always on mute with closed caption.

The minuses are... well I can't think of any... ummm... the fish tank could be better maintained? lol... gun to the head, seriously. lol. 

Overall, I love this place. I go often, infact, I want to go tomorrow, I SERIOUSLY need some fills. Hope to see you there!

Believe the hype. I stopped here for lunch with my husband before we continued on with our errands for the day. It is a cozy place with a neighborhood vibe. There is a deli and cheese counter in the front, along with a rack of specialty Italian ingredients and sauces for sale in the back of the restaurant. We actually picked up some stuff there because my sister in law and her husband were coming to visit from Italy and had promised us a home cooked Italian meal.

We chose to split the Antipasti salad that was prepared with a generous assortment of meat and cheese from the deli case. The salad was fresh and plentiful for the price of $12.00. We also split the very hearty Italian meat sandwich which only  comes in large (most of the sandwiches you have the option between regular and large). This was a monster of a sandwich with juicy beef, melted provolone and mozzarella cheese topped with pepperocinis. As delicious as it was, I could only handle about quarter of the sandwich. The husband happily annihilated the rest of it. The service was friendly and this made for a perfect break in our busy day.

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

The ultimate gelato paradise! They offer an array of mouthwatering, high quality gelato which are always deliciously decadent and wildly unique. I mean, come on, creamy sweet corn gelato or spicy rocoto chili & pimento cheese gelato!? These two captured my heart and my tastebuds. The very first bite you'll just want to close your eyes in sweet reverie and savor the magical treat.

I've also had the pleasure of trying the incredibly rich fior di latte (milky mozzarella) -holy cow it's so luscious and creamy! The beautiful basil gelato is super icy and also uber refreshing on a scorching hot day. Pistachio gelato is very creamy and nutty. Plus, the chai tea latte is milky and comforting. Oh! and for the outrageous and adventurous palates - how about steak and eggs gelato?! Yup, they often offer bizarre and unheard of flavors that are just as great as conversational pieces and as for taste? Spot on! 

I'm constantly finding myself daydreaming about trying new flavors on my next visit at AOF! Until next time, my dreamy goddess!

$10 house cocktails - the good. 

$100 minimums on the blackjack tables here - the cray cray.

Great spot to end a gambling night with a Bourbon. This bar is all about the whiskey and dark spirits as there is no beer here. Really good selection of whiskey. A list of cocktails to choose from that are reasonably priced. I'm a bourbon guy so "Whiskey In The Jar" and "One In The Chamber" were my drinks of choice here. Tasty and made right.

It's a nice spot to wind down the evening right on the casino floor, but it's not a boisterous loud bar. It's more of a leather couch and quiet conversation place to kick back and relax with a well made bourbon drink. Dimly lit and low key. 

Sure, there are some tables inside here to play a few hands but with the high minimums I viewed only one brave soul throwing down the Benjamins. Not me! I'll head to the $10 blackjack table! With my bourbon cocktail of course.

Neon and Fun pretty much describes what it's like at the fremont experience.

If you have never been downtown Vegas it's a must at least once and walking up and down fremont street is just something you do when your down there.  I wouldn't say it's something you want to do every visit but once in a decade or so would be pretty much all you need.

The light show with music above is pretty fun to watch.  They put in a zipline which was not there last time I visited the place.  It's a pretty popular thing to do as the lines were pretty long.  It looked like fun but I don't care to be hanging by a rope up high like that.  To each is own I say!

DISCLAIMER:
I have been a journalist. I worked for the StarTribune for four years. Of course this was before online news swallowed our culture. I miss the ole days. The sound of typewriters hammering in the newsroom. The smell of the first press newsprint. The smell of cigarettes, coffee and donuts on the reporters desks. I had a ritual every day no matter where I lived. Wake. Pee. Make coffee. Grab paper from front door. Sit. Read. Sip coffee and take in the events of yesterday. It was a slow, newsworthy slip into my reality. Now. Not so much. I've tried reading the Republic. Even had a Letter to the Editor published with my take on the 04 presidential elections when I insisted Al Gore would win by a landslide over George Bush. Remember that? But your lack of local flavor, coverage and slew of AP material makes me realize you are just okay and a product of the times. I find you a bit stodgy, stale and old school. But I'm a sucker for the old newspaper days and hope you can spice it up and stick around while so many other big city papers shut their doors.

Delicious! The Hey Joe Special is comprised of perfectly tender and moist chicken (served on the bone, slightly awkward/messy but really really perfectly done), beautifully seasoned pork, and lumpia for $8, along with a pinch of salad and a healthy scoop of rice for the sides. The lumpia were (was? i don't know Filipino food) crispy and savory - I'm glad I splashed the sweet/spicy sauce Brian recommended on them. The pork had an intriguing citrus flavor which I loved. 

The Hey Joe truck will be at 18th Ave & Deer Valley on Mondays from 11-1 for the foreseeable future (your best way to find them is to follow them at twitter.com/heyjoetruck), and I will be there w/ an appetite.

I had a gift card and decided to place an order for pick-up. This CPK is located in Town Square. There is a pick-up door, but if there is parking near it I couldn't find it. Crowded is the proper word for Town Square! With no parking spot in sight and tons of people wandering around, hubby dropped me off out front. I was greeted when I walked in and the food was ready. The pizza came in a to-go carrier with handles that was very convenient. I ordered the "Untraditional Cheese Pizza" priced at $9.75 that was cheesy and good. Most pizzas with more than one cheese have a smokey type of cheese on it and this one didn't, which I loved. Simple and good! 

You can place your pick-up order over the phone or online. The online ordering is very user friendly.

Typical TarJay story for any of us...thought I'd spend $100 and doubled that in the bonus lane apparently. All in all. Not that Super. Just Bigger. C'mon, give me super. Give me great. Give me. Target Heaven!!!!

I could walk blindfolded and nude around my Safeway on Osborn and 7th Avenue. And still find what I need. Blindfolded? Well, to prove my point at how well I  know my local market. Nude? Well, c'mon, it just sounds fun doesn't it? So, needless to say I hate shopping at a new store cuz I don't know where stuff is. I was looking for smoothies at Fresh & Easy and found everything but. Ha. I said but. Like butt. Me funny. The lack of signage or poor signage made me a little nutty. Ok. Ok. Gawd. More nutty. Whatev. But I found a fantastic selection of power bars at a fantastic price. I saw one employee the whole time I was in there. Self checkout is ok, but this place lacks some serious heart and soul. While sometimes I get annoyed at the robotic employees at Safeway, forced to say hello to anyone who bats an eyelash or breathes in their direction, here at F&E, there was no one. Except for Larry. And he seemed cold. Goddamn it's cold in there. Can you say HEADLIGHTS?!He was layered in clothing.  In Phoenix. In August. Ugh. Poor Larry. F&E. Is that for Frigid & Exposed? I'll be back. But I won't be blindfolded. Or nude. Your loss.

Great experience, never have had a problem and they give Yelp discounts. Yes!

We've used Blue Sky many times and the service is pretty straight forward. Almost all the spaces are covered, a clear plus for those 110 degree summer days.  For the most part, it takes about ten to fifteen minutes from when we park our car, to when get off their shuttles bus. Pretty quick!

So, yes "we're a Fan"!

I like this park. Rickie hit a home run in this park. Just. For. Me. 

I like this park. It has trees for shade. Though I would like this park more if they had WAY more trees. I would like this park more if the concrete bleachers were covered. And how about some hot dog vendors!? Beer? The ice cream guy just wasn't cutting it!

I like this park because softball wives are allowed in the dugout during the game. Yep. Covered. With a bench. Cold water. Ha! All the saps out in the sun, melting like Melanie Griffith's face. 

Really though the road leading to this park is pretty ghetto and lined with trailer parks, piles of cars and piles of tires. So I was not looking forward to the park. What a surprise. Very clean. HUGE. Great parking. Restrooms...not too bad...I mean it's not The Plaza but there was soap and working hand dryers. 

I like Cesar Chavez Park. I'm returning Sunday. Where Rickie will hit yet another home run. Just. For. Me.

I went to Rose.Rabbit.Lie. with my best friend, Leandra T., and I think she was correct when describing RRL as "just the right amount of wrong"  la the Cosmopolitan's tagline.  After seeing several billboards and taxi tops marketing RRL as a grand social experiment, our curiosity got the best of us, and we ended up catching the 12AM show.  I was taken aback when entering the venue, because I was anticipating Vegas' generic club scene, but my speculations were completely inaccurate.

We were seated by an usher in the center ring, and a show of human beat boxing, contortionists, dancers, singers, and a variety of performers appeared on stage one after the other.  My friends and I sat utterly bewildered when the pleasant surprise of a show appeared before us (as opposed to a bunch of drunks bumping & grinding--but that comes later, of course).

I'm giving my five stars solely on the show and club that presented itself immediately afterwards.  The performers grab you on the floor, and what was previously the stage turns into a dance floor.  I have yet to indulge in RRL's dining or cocktails, but I suppose that gives me an excuse to venture out to Las Vegas again soon. :)

I highly recommend visiting RRL when you're on the strip.  It's a beautiful mix of classy and bizarre.

This IS a gastropub!!!  

150 bottle selections including a huge number of difficult to find, limited edition and seasonal brews, 20+ international and microbrews on tap, multiple cask matured ales tapped on site all backed by one of the most interesting and diverse international wine list, 300+ selections strong and a more than decent malt list.   Now were talking!

And the food.  This isn't your usual fish and chips, sliders, and nachos.  This is pub fare at it's finest.  The bone marrow served with a bacon marmalade and coarse sea salt is so rich, unctuous, and just plain good eats once spread on some grilled bread.  The four inch long bones does a great job preventing the marrow from overcooking. Perfect.

Other must try plates include the grilled octopus, potted duck rillettes, veal sweetbreads with a refreshing green apple slaw, and the blow your mind great poutine (thin fries topped with duck confit and a cheese curd sauce).  Finally, the lump crab salad that is more crab than greens accompanied by a tempura avocado and supreme of grape fruit.  Well balanced and delicious.

Note:  the dishes are made to be paired with beer or wine.  They taste salty if eaten alone.

Prices are in line with other true gastropubs.  Beers average $10. Wines below typical Vegas resorts.  

Service is excellent.  Bartenders and servers are extremely knowledgeable.  Amazing considering how quickly the selection of brews change.

Highly recommended for a good time!

What would a visit to Las Vegas be without stopping by to see the Pawn Stars, Chumlee, Corey, Rick and the "Old Man." Being it was Veterans Day I thought getting my picture taken with the "Old Man", a fellow Navy Vet, would be just the thing. We arrived to find several hundred other people had ALSO decided to stop by. A large crowd was outside the door, standing around, taking pictures, just hanging out. Inside was filled, shoulder to shoulder, almost too crowded to hold up a Chumlee tshirt or find those much desired "Gold and Silver Pawn" key chains. We had pushed about 8 feet into the store when the security guy at the door said "CLEAR the store for filming. Every OUT!" He was standing up, a big guy, so we turned around and moved outside again. Dona said "No, we are NOT going to hang around to see what happens... " Anyway, happy vets day Old Man!!

Azure is Palazzo's "adult pool" for 21 and over guests. We checked this pool out twice but stayed for a total of no more than 15 minutes... 

The first day, my 31 year old cousin couldn't get in because she forgot her ID (yes, she looks young). The second day, we were disappointed to find out as we entered that there is a $50 minimum food and drink charge per pool chair (the same ones that are free at the "regular" Palazzo pool) and a $300 minimum charge for the big square lounging cushions that can fit a few people. The food (by Wolfgang Puck) and drinks aren't cheap but that is still a lot of itmes to purchase for one chair... There was a free area in the shade in the back corner of the Azure area...

It was nice to have a dj that was not too insanely loud but the music was a little bit too techno for me. I preferred the music (and the scene in general) at Tao Beach. I might recommend Azure if you really want to get away from any children though and are probably in your late 20's or early 30's...

I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's, but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a "Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a "Kids Pizza" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! 

They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program.

My company ordered a combo pan roast and an oyster gumbo, both were great as well! Especially the pan roast! I would have to say that my seafood jambalaya was best of all of them! It had lobster tail, clams, mussels, oysters, crab, shrimp and other goodies! I had them give me a 7 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it had quite a kick!

Roberto's is a greasy mess and I love it! There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and Roberto's is one of them. Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube. 

I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a "Chicken Taco" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The "Rolled Tacos" and "Carne Asada Fries" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff! 


They also have combination plates that include rice and beans. If you like Menudo they serve it on Saturdays and Sundays.

I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger. 

Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation. 

The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now. 

Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.

Want to eat the same seafood at the same freshness as the Italians without making the journey?  Gamberi roso recent plucked from the Mediterranean, moleche from the Venetian Leguna, live giant langoustines?  Steve Wynn's endless trunks of money and chef Paul Bartolotta's passion for the best make it possible.

Straight up; quality and freshness comes at a price.  Daily catch, air flown from the Mediterrranean but at five times retail ($70 per pound for branzino, $100 per pound for a slipper lobster), is it worth the price?

LIVE LANGOUSTINES.  Dispatched seconds before it's split, seasoned and grilled.  The flesh, firm and juicy with a sweet upfront taste with a clean oceanic finish.  Delicious claws.  The head fat, oh the head fat!  Why live?  Langoustines flavor rapidly fades and the texture turns mushy.  Incredibly difficult to ship.  Only a handful of restaurants offer it.  $30 to $45 each making indulging on a pile an expensive treat. 

Next up, gamberi rossi (Deep sea Mediterranean red prawns).  Simply grilled, firm outer texture, meltingly rich, sweet with hints of iodine.  Intensely flavored creamy head fat, perfect spread on bread.  Huge, larger than your hand and despite being $35 each, you will be longing for more than one.

Finally the moleche, the tiny soft shell crabs from the Venetian Leguna available only between April and May and  October to November.  Deep fried, moist and intensely crabby on the inside.  Simply put, good eats.

Other standout dishes; A warm salad of flash sauteed, artichoke, porcini mushroom and wilted arugula salad with a huge shaving of salty pecorino Italian simplicity.  Tender Ligurian octopus chunks tossed in olive oil and fresh lemon juice, simplicity.  A spaghetti with bortaga (salted, dried fish eggs), tomato and saffron whisks you to southern Italy.  And the risotto of ricci (sea urchins) and scallops, ethereal.  

Excellent, unpretentious service.  Servers are skilled at table side service for most whole fish.

Very good Italian centric wine list.  High Vegas resort prices.

A taste of Italy that will leave you longing to return.

Pizza by the slice open until 3:00 a.m. is the lure of Sirrico's Pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino. Is the pizza good? Nope. Is it worth $5? Maybe. Will you be full? Probably.

The line at 12:30 a.m. was about 15 minutes long. Basically, you pick  a slice or two from the pre-made pizzas and then it is reheated as you head to the register. The happiest customers seemed to be those getting whole pies to go.

The pizza line also was the scene of one of the saddest things I saw in Vegas. A possibly homeless person right in front of me got a slice of pizza, discreetly folded it, stuffed it in his pocket, and headed for the door. It broke my heart and made me want to give him my slice, too.

I got a slice of Jalapeno and Pepperoni. It put some quick carbs in my belly and let me get back out on the casino floor. Let Sirrico's Pizza do the same for you if you are just hungry.

Hanny's ... you have quite the tasty Riesling. 

But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.

On the flip side, you have hot hot hot bartenders, so I really don't mind the wait (sorry DG).

My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean, I really really love the bathrooms. 

Actually, I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar, I would want it to look exactly like Hanny's. Well, except the meat cutter at the bar, because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)

Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.

Yeah, Hanny's ... I love you. Quite a bit. Let's go steady.

Good grubbing of the island kine.

We had a quick breakfast pick up here during a recent visit in Vegas with friends and ordered up a lot of food.

Breakfast spread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#zJ1UnVQ_qWLwg_wxRC-UXA  We got the basics Portugese sausage and eggs, lots of Spam musubi!  You cant go to a place called aloha kitchen and not get musubi's!  These were of good size and a nice thick cut of spam unlike same places there the ratio is more rice than spam.

Adobo fried rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#7HB73c6cPjKml2mVyEt2kw  This was a pretty tasty omelette with lots of adobo inside.  Def a must get!

I didn't actually go to pick up the order so I cant speak to how the place is.

Nose ~ Smells Yum!.
Ear ~ Everyone happy with the food.

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!

And with that, I knew the "Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibrico De Bellota" (made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed Ibrico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  

I semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  

The seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   

Bottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait, he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to "e" asap!

I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. 

Went there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. 

Low and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. 

This place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. 

Bottom line don't go there. If you do go, do not go in the VIP room and DO NOT pay with a credit card.  Stay away from this scam of a place. Go to spearmint rhino or sapphire if you are looking for some adult entertainment.

One of the better Chinese buffets in the Charlotte area, this one has a pretty decent selection of sushi items and the remaining hot bar items were tasty and varied. Yep, even a few things that have nothing to do with Chinese food like mac & cheese.

My only complaint is that the times posted on the glass above the sushi were never updated. We were here at close to 2:30 but the times were all marked "10:58" and we did see several items refreshed.

The map pin might be in the wrong place. They're located at the corner of North Tryon and McCullogh, south of WT Harris.

Get stuffed!  Literally.

Not health food.  Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins, added calories from cheeses and spreads; this is Vegas.  Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap.

The carvery is the focus.  Select half or a full pound of the protein, bread and two sauces.  Simples.  Do select heartier breads (sandwich breads turn to mush).  Stick to simple sauces (black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream) if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins.  Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli.  Outstanding, brisket.  Dripping with juices, deep flavor, just the right amount of fat.  The lamb, cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor.  Finally, the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone.  Moist and crisp when heated.  All good eats.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg.  The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches.

Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon.  The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams.  The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done.  Tender, just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth.  The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive.

Standard pub fare (fish and chips; very good with perfectly cooked, heavily battered, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy) are great.

Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local (real people living real lives).

Great energy and pub ambiance.  Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground, bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time, games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest.

Note:  Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine.  

Many, many repeat visits.  Always consistent.

Cheeers!

If I was a girl I would *so* want to buy everything here and dance around the house in my lingerie all day long.  The place is a visual treat whether you are capable of buying something for yourself of picking up something for someone you know who has boobs.

The staff here is wonderful as well.  The first interaction I had with them was a conversation about my tattoos rather than being pestered about whether I was shopping for *someone special* followed by the hard sell.  In fact they seemed to be happy just having me browse around the shop taking in all of the bras, panties, riding crops, and whatever.

Just a Note:  girls with big boobers should not shy away from this place.  They have a very nice selection of items for sizes that are normally not carried in the other big name lingerie stores.

Let's "name drop" for a moment - 

Bill Clinton, former president of the UNITED STATES. Vince Neil, former lead singer of MOTLEY CRUE. These guys have been at the hotel while I was there - need I say more? 

It should tell you that this place is for everyone, whether world leader or rock legend (or even me).

My highlight list:

- Small, comfortable casino
- Irish pub
- Nice rooms
- Great pool area
- Classy joint
- Reasonably priced

This is a really nice example of one of the Station casino properties located some 10 minutes from McCarren airport & the Las Vegas strip.

This & other Station properties are very generous with offering discounted or free room accommodations if they know who you are, so remember to always use your Players Card.

We really liked Hopdoddy's fresh new variety, but found the burgers themselves a little bland.

One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr

The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.

BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible. 

Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate. 

Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer.

Yep. David B. Once again the wise sage atop Mount Yelp. I called another locksmith who never returned my call. I called Stagecoach and they said they could help me tomorrow. That's cool. I had a safe in my office and the batteries died and I was unable to open the safe. But you have to open the safe to put in new batteries. Suckky I know! Stagecoach called back and said they can be here in an hour. YEE HAW! Stagecoach to the rescue. I expected a horse and buggy with a rugged Michael Landon (post bed wetting problem, pre Little House on the Prairie...c'mon he was a hottie!) to pull into my parking lot and save the day. Well. That didn't happen. On accounta he's dead. But it was a man named Dean. Lean, mean Dean! No. Not mean at all. He fixed my safe. Installed new batteries at no charge. Yep. Free. Last time I got free batteries was at Castle Boutique when I bought a...oh...wait...my mom reads these reviews. Anyhoo. You got key issues. Lock is jammed. Or your office safe is on the fritz. Get out your ole rotary phone and give Stagecoach a holler!

I stop at Chloe's Corner about once a week for a quick bite.  They do a nice business because they're the only sandwich place in Kierland Commons, for those of us who work nearby.

Like Sarah Y, I love their Egg Salad sandwiches.  It's creamy without being slopping with a hint of Coleman's mustard.  Another joy is just sitting at the counter and having a fountain drink (see photo).  Besides the Egg Salad, another one of my favorites is their rare Roast Beef sandwich (photo).  Both are delicious.

Chloe's is very reminiscent of the old days, when you could buy a sandwich at Walgreen's.  That how they started off, as a small drugstore serving sandwiches and fountain drinks back in Chicago.  Clearly they grew well beyond that concept.  For those from the east coast, it's like the old Chock-full-of-nuts coffee shops.  By the way, the soups at Chloe's are amazing.

Most of Chloe's sandwiches are in the $6.50 to $7.50 range and are delicious.  Don't forget that they also offer a freshly brewed cup of their signature coffee for only 50 cents!  A bottomless cup as they say.

Enjoy!

Since my previous review about the new corporate version of this once loved establishment was flagged and removed i'll try again. It was removed  "because it does not contain a new firsthand experience with the business." Now why they think it wasn't based off of an experience is beyond me. (mind readers maybe??) 
Anyways, this is not the "Original Penguin" that gained all the acclaim. Notice the "TM" after the name now. 
It is a lame, shell of a version of the restaurant that once lived. Wait staff was inattentive, food was greasy, I don't expect it to last long. 

If you are looking for food inspired by the original Penguin, try Pinkys Westside, or The Diamond. Corporate entity's have no business swallowing up a local legend, and demanding the same respect of the community, please support local business.

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

Service is friendly and very efficient.

Very good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

3.5 STARS

What makes MGM Grand so GRAND?!?!
Is it because the building and all it's splendor is emerald green?
Is it because the gold gigantic lion out front can be spotted a mile away?
Is it because there is some connection to the Wizard of Oz?
Is it because they hold boxing matches here? 
Is it because they are the head company that pretty much owns a couple other casinos down the Las Vegas Strip?!

I remember staying at the MGM when I was younger and had some fam bam trips to Vegas. The rooms were decent and filled with your typical amenities of a hotel room. I think the rooms are much better in quality compared to Luxor & Excalibur. When I stayed at the MGM, the Skylofts & The Signature (luxury boutique hotel rooms) were not built yet. But nonetheless, a decent stay at the regular rooms. 

RESTAURANTS
[SUPER SWANKY]
* Joel Robuchon (French - 3 Michelin Stars)
* L' atelier de Joel Robuchon (4 Michelin Stars)
* Tom Colicchio's craft steak (For all you carniwhores & Top Chef fans!)  

[SWANKY]
* Diego Mexican Cuisine
* Emeril's New Orleans Fish House
* Fiamma Trattoria & Bar
* Nob Hill Tavern (Michael Mina)
* Pearl (Chinese)
* Sea Blue (Michael Mina; currently renovating and will open 2013)
* Shibuya (Japanese)
* Wolfgang Puck
* MGM Grand Buffet
* 'Wichcraft (Tom Colicchio's Sammie shop; not as swanky as the others)

PARTY ROCKERS & PRE-PARTY HOT SPOTS
* Hakkasan Nightclub(debut 2013)
* Tabu Nightclub
* Wet Republic Ultra Pool
* Centrifuge (crafty cocktails)
* Rouge Bar
* Zuri Bar
* West Wing Bar

ENTERTAINMENT
* Brad Garrett's Comedy Club
* Hollywood Theater
* David Copperfield
* Ka Cirque Du Soleil
* Boxing matches at MGM Grand
* Concerts at MGM Grand Garden Arena
* Conference Center and Ballrooms (on the other side of the casino)

Given this laundry list of items, you can imagine how large this casino would be! It took me a good 30 minutes to get to the conference center as it is located on the opposite side of the casino! The food catered at the conference center was quite upscale and top notch! Consider it 100x better than what the Holiday Inn would serve you in a banquet! I wouldn't mind coming back to the MGM for a conference nor staying at the hotel. It's pretty decent if you're looking for something in the middle of the strip.

OK. This is it people. This is why we are here. Right? This is the time of year we phone relatives back home, donned in flip flops, board shorts and Ray Bans. We say things like, "Ohhhh, I forgot it's 32 degrees, snowing, sleeting and you have dark dismal clouds looming overhead." "I'm by the pool flipping burgers in my new swim suit I got at Marshall's" (ok, I wouldn't reveal that, I would say Saks 5th Ave., but work with me people!). Even though we're still "struggling" with these unseasonal temps (a la upper 80s's), our relatives, friends and family we left behind are snuckering down (did I say snuckering?) in their moon boots and parkas. Us? We? We're still chillin' in our favorite T's, shorts and sandals. The point for this review? Hmmmm. to review us. To review the weather. And the jab at the rest of the good ole US of A. I know Phoenix is waiting for a heartbeat. I know there are newbies who don't get us yet. And that's ok.  I feel the energy of the desert. I feel the energy of a new city emerging from the ashes. I feel the uncomfortableness from this nasty ass IKEA chair on my butt. While I know it's time to sign off and find comfort elsewhere, I just had to say....I LOVE Phoenix and if you don't, go somewhere else, drop the negativity and find your mojo within yourself!

UPDATE 9/8/14 - Just reading through recent comments that clearly mirror my experience. Then I saw the review by "John C" on 5/23/14 on here stating that they "stayed there on bank holiday" and would "stay there again". Therein lies one of the ongoing problems that sadly hasn't changed since we moved out. It is NOT a hotel and should not have transient people staying there on holiday. Sad, yet not surprised to see the state of affairs at Ogden seems to be getting worse, not better.

While I appreciate everything that Tony Hsieh and Zappos are doing for downtown, I do not enjoy sharing this building with them! Tony lives in the building and another 50 or so Zappos employees live here as well. In addition, Zappos uses a lot of the units for offices and "crash pads", where visitors to Zappos and the Downtown Project spend a couple of nights then move on. On my floor alone, there are about 8 residents, the rest of the units are rented out by Zappos. Parking is a joke as there is only 1 space per unit, even for a 2 bedroom unit (where does the other occupant park, you might ask? Wherever you can find an open space downtown). The guest spaces in the garage are taken by tourists and people going out downtown looking for free parking and the many daily Zappos visitors. The music is unbearably loud, even at 4:00am and often rattles the windows. Homeless people use the dog run area as their personal outhouse (gross). If you enjoy living with rude, high 20 year-olds whose rent is being paid by their boss and therefore have no consideration or appreciation for where they live or those around them, then this is the place for you. If you prefer some sense of decency, organization and civility, look elsewhere!

Creative.  Inventive.  The perfect melange of flavors.  A modern dining experience based on sensory overload thanks to the restrained use of molecular gastronomy.  

The menu was changed in December 2012.  Sadly the stunning steak tartare with white truffle powder is gone.  What replaced it lessens the sorrow.

The crisp duck confit spring rolls with its over the top, umame "injection" of truffles and a truffle aioli, OMG!  The gaminess of the duck is brought out by the earthy truffles.  A delicious flavor that goes on and on (translated:  the fat from the confit and oil in the aioli coats your tongue in a good way).

The seared foie with hazelnut crust, excellent.  Foietastic nuttiness contrasting perfectly with the puckering verjus and the essence of grapes.  Simply put, wow.

The Kushi oyster, amazing.  Served atop liquid nitrogen and dressed with lemon juice and orange pearls.  Eat it quick.  The liquid nitrogen super chills the oyster without freezing it.  Biting into the oyster and popping the citrus caviar creates a eruption of flavors.  Think, frozen vodka shot.

The tarte flambee (crisp, wafer thin flat bread topped with onion, bacon, asparagus, crme fraiche, and truffles), and the raw ahi taco (baby taco shells filled with an avocado cream, crisp and hot Serrano chili, and a ponzu suspension) are both worthy of special mention.  

Friendly, knowledgeable servers.

Very good, well chosen, global, mid range wine list.  Most bottles under $80.  Vegas resort pricing.  For something special be sure to try the "liquid nitrogen enhancement" to their signature cocktails.  The table side show flash freezes your drink into a heady sorbet.  The first "bite" is an indescribable sensory overload.

The lesson, when in doubt, try.

This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy!
There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg
It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

This is a very impressive worship space, one which I was fortunate enough to visit just before it's consecration a few months ago. 

An LDS friend gave me a private grand tour and I came away very much amazed with all the work and effort put into this Temple. The only down side was my inability to take any pictures inside. 

For those who know me, I would have normally have taken a couple of dozen pictures. So I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't allowed, per Mormon custom.  But it was something which I respected on my visit.

This is also one of the largest temples I've ever seen and the grounds are massive. Probably on a par with the one in Las Vegas. The only other LDS Temple I've been inside, is one back in Glenview, Illinois, which is tiny by comparisons. 

I left amazed and very impressed.

Vegas marches on and in a few months, Osteria del Circo is closing.

Part of famed restaurateur Sirio Maccioni's empire.  Circo offers Italian inspired food with a few hidden gems of true authenticity.  But first:

RANT:  In whose mind is this an "osteria"?  An osteria, the simplest, most austere type of Italian eatery.  Pastas, grilled or roasted meats, endless glasses of house wine. Good, simple living.  With it's beautifully crafted dishes, whimsical, lake side dining room, 900 selection wine cellar, this is not an osteria.

Searching for the authentic, an excellent fritto misto.  Lightly coated, perfectly cooked, crisp fried calamari zucchini flowers with a vibrant cherry tomato sauce.   The Antipasto del Circo per La Tavola is equally simple and delicious.  A good selection of Italian cheese, cured salumi and fruits.  

For secondi, the most classic of pastas shine.  The Buccatini al Amatriciana near Roman perfect.  Toothsome, fresh pasta enveloped with an acidic sauce of pancetta, tomato, wine and pecorino romano.  Not to be outdone, the Gnocchi al Pesto Gratinati.  Perfect pillows in a warm, herbaceous pesto tossed with Parmigianino.  A velvety rich bite accented by toasted pine nuts for texture.

Finally the Bistecca alla Fiorentina.  Although not from the famed Chianina cow of Tuscany, the 40 day aged porterhouse for two, cooked very rare and dressed simply with olive oil is excellent.  Festive, fun to eat.  Nuff said.  The rack of lamb with a pecorino and thyme crust is equally good.  Very meaty, well trimmed, tender and perfectly cooked throughout.  

Good plate of flavorful biscotti and some vin santo make for a classic dessert.

Very good, friendly and efficient service.  Excellent Italian centric wine list with many reasonably priced bottle from a wide variety of DOCGs.

As we sip our amaro, the words of Anthony Bourdain ring true:  "Into each life a little bitterness".

Farewell Circo.  Ciao grazie.

I read a Yelp talk thread that was singing the praises of Niccoli's Deli & Pizza a couple of months ago. So I decided to take the plunge after my office moved to CenPho.

This is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.

They don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.

I definitely will be a regular customer of Niccoli's.

Could this store BE any smaller (said in my best Chandler Bing voice)? I seriously walked in with Rickie, stayed 90 seconds, and said "Dude, I gotta git outta here!" Fortunately they had a guitarist/singer on the back patio with a coffee pot full of java and some cookies. How cool is that? Said musician was eventually joined by a little girl who played her clarinet. Played is being kind. Poor thing. That clarinet squeaked more than the brakes on my 95 ghetto beemer. More than Peter Brady's voice during puberty. But how cute it was. How very Bohemian. Rickie scored The Knife CD he's been looking for and the staff was VERY helpful and not all weird slacker don't bother me cuz I'm too cool to move from behind the counter cuz I just know you two queers are looking for Brittney Spears or Madonna crap and that is so lame...NO...not at all.

This year. I went to  Pride. With my mom. My 74 year old, deliciously and overwhelmingly, unconditionally loving mom! Easily one of my favorite days I've ever spent with this saintly human. She was accompanied by her 60ish year old female cousin. Yep. They played lesbians! They thought they were the shit. And they were. While no tonguing occurred (thankfully, that would have been scarring), they did hold hands at one point and giggled. 

I've attended LA, SF, Long Beach, San Diego and NYC Prides. I have a soft spot for our little desert Mayberry Pride. I wish the walk from 3rd Ave and Indian School to the main gate wasn't such a hike. I was exhausted by the time I reached the front gate. But a perfect reason to run straight (ha ha, I said straight) to the beer stand. 

Beer was cold. Brats were hot. Bears were hairy. Twinks were rail ass thin. Lesbians in Wranglers. Port a potties were CLEAN but SO FREAKIN' HOT! 

Second best part next to being with mom and my man....NTUIT's performance. If you haven't seen this dynamo duo, you MUST get their CD! I am biased as I love them both. Oh. And I have a cameo on their last track, Celebrity Life...

Pride. Proud. Budding recording artist. And yep Gay as ever!

I initially had my closets designed by another company and they did a nice job but I soon realized that what they had designed for me was not functional for my needs. There were way too many shelves and not enough hanging space. I had hired a professional organizer and she was in the process of helping me put my closet back together. Once she had evaluated what needed to go where, she suggested getting rid of most of the shelves and instead adding several pull down hanging racks, a few extra hanging bars as well as some pull out belt racks. She contacted California Closets for help. She was only in town for a short time and expressed her interest in having someone come out right away so she could finish this project the way it should be done. Fortunately enough, California Closets was able to accommodate me and sent someone out to my house the very next day. My new closet is finally perfect. I was so impressed with them and the fact that they saved the day that I'm going to hire them to organize my guestroom closet once I'm ready. Thanks again for everything California Closets! :)

This Swiss bakery has been my go-to spot for cakes and macarons. I first noticed this bakery on Yelp, and the owner makes everything from scratch with natural ingredients. Foot traffic is rare, and the interior encompasses large glass cases, tiled floor, and colorful chocolates and European pastries to fill out the dcor.

The quarter sheet Custard Cake ($29.98) came with soft spongy cake, custard, and airy textures with moderate sweetness. My friends raved about its light-tasting qualities and I really enjoyed it too. The website says the cake can feed 15-20 people, but I always have leftovers to share with others.

The quarter sheet Tiramisu ($29.98) came with good moisture and mascarpone flavor, but the consistency of the custard needed to be more refined. The overall flavor was borderline bland, and without rum this cake could use another anchor such as an aromatic coffee to render that special effect. It was a solid cake, but I have had better.

I absolutely loved their Macarons ($1.50). It all started with a crisp airy texture, followed by a soft chew and persistent flagrant ganache at the center. I have tried the Red Velvet, Pistachio, Chocolate Orange, Pumpkin Pie, Almond, Blueberry, and Coconut flavors. They were all striking, memorable, and the fruit flavors were particularly delectable. The textures and flavors on these Macarons were consistent on each of my previous visits. It never fails.

Each time the service was forward, efficient, and responsive. I find it helpful to communicate directly with the owner, as he is knowledgeable and always finds ways to meet my expectations. Eventually I'd like to order off the menu and try the Saint Honore Cake, Poppy Seed Bread, and other Macaron flavors.

If you haven't figured it out by now, what makes this pool memorable is the Lazy River section.

If floating around and mingling with others is not your kinda thing or if you have the family with you, MGM definitely has many other pools to relax in.  

During my last visit here, there were kids in our group. Most people would tell you to leave the kids by the other pool, but they weren't my kids so it went kinda like this ...


Water Gun + Adorable 6 year old + Lazy River + "Shoot Her" = Ultimate Wingman


Get there early, snag a spot in the shade or somewhere near Wet Republic, hop in the lazy river then drink and mingle the day away.  


I can't think of a better way to spend a hot day in Vegas.  

I'm lying. I can but this is definitely top 10.


PS - don't be lazy. They have a ton of restrooms

There are a few rules to follow when in Vegas:

1) Don't marry a stripper.

2) Don't drink & gamble on an empty stomach.

3) Don't call the number on those fliers people hand out to you on the strip. You'll just end up marrying a hooker. That's worse than a stripper if you're wondering.

So as I wanted to adhere to this rule system, my BF & I paid a visit to the Earl of Sandwich before going out for drinks and gambling. For $5.99 these sandwiches are a crazy good deal! I had the roast beef w/ horseradish and I loved how the bread is nicely toasted. I highly recommend if you're looking to get a quick bite.

Oh and when we stepped back out on the strip I told the man handing out fliers to my BF that he already had a naked girl...but thank you!

"If you need me I'll be watching CSI from the bathtub." 

And that's exactly what I did thanks to the nice little TV on the wall in the bathroom. 

With this all suites hotel connected to Mandalay Bay I was quite pleased when we rolled in. After watching 'The Hangover' 50 times I've had an urge to step up the Vegas game and while we didn't wake up with a tiger in the bathroom I can say this was one of the nicest rooms I've had in my 20+ trips to Vegas. 

Two sinks in the main bathroom. Very nice shower and the deepest of bathtubs. Two big ass flat screen TVs in the bedroom and living room. Extra bathroom off the living room in case you have a friend who is ready to blow chunks from too much partying. 

Our view from the 24th floor had me drunkenly staring from the Mandalay pools to the neighboring hotels and off into the hills. Gorgeous. 

What an amazing stay, I could have slept the rest of my life away in that bed. So comfortable. 

People say Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel... Next time you hear that just say "Pshhhh, I'll be in THEhotel. Mandalay Bay standard is for chumps." Pretty good episode of CSI too.

Chino Bandido is my guilty pleasure. It is utterly unhealthy food served in an aluminum foil bowl, delivered by a casually dressed employee who shouts your name until you claim it. And, you get a soft snickerdoodle cookie, as if there were not enough calories and carbs in the meal itself.

It's a dive. Black and white checkered floors. Murals and polaroids of customers mounted on the walls behind plastic.

Ayesha is right. It's a love/hate kind of place; and, those who love it will blurt out what they order at the mere mention - it's practically involuntary. 

Me? I'm "jerk chicken add black beans." I have the number programmed into my phone so I can call in my order.

It's also addictive for those who like it. I am generally compelled to visit Chino within 72 hours of hearing someone mention it.

Here's the thing about Chino Bandido: it is NOT Chinese and it is NOT Mexican. It is Chino Bandido. It's its own animal. 

To try to label it can only lead to disappointment. So, I suggest: 
~ Know that we are not talking fast food prices -- a one item bowl with a soft drink is $9.15.
~ Enter with an open mind. 
~ Proceed immediately to the counter under the menu with all the pictures on it and tell the employee it's your first time. The employee will slip you a bunch of samples so you can taste what you're in for. 
~ Figure out what you like and accept help from the employee while you complete the unique order form (which is also demonstrated on the website: http://www.chinobandido.com/order.html).
~ Enjoy!

Not imperial Thai or even Americanized Thai.  It's Swanky Thai, keeping the traditional flavors but replacing the primary ingredients with upend versions.

It doesn't work.  A Chilean sea bass is destroyed.  It's subtle oily flavor hammered by a fiery chili paste.  Marinated Cornish hens with garlic so overpowering that only it's shape and mouth feel let you know what is.  Just the opposite, using rib steak in the drunken noodles robs the dish of the beefy flavor and  sinewy, fatty texture that a humble cut of beef would bring.  

Thankfully there are more traditional dishes that really shine.  

The Pla Tod Yum Ta Krai (fried whole tilapia with lemongrass salad, dried shrimp and cashew nuts) is excellent.  The flesh of the fish, overcooked and rubbery near the skin just as it should be.  The slight muddy flavor enhanced by the dried shrimp, perfumed by lemongrass and brightened by a lime, chili, and fish sauce drizzle.

Lo-Ba (braised then fried pig ear, tongue, and heart served with fresh cucumber and "sauce") sounds disgusting.  It's well worth the try.  Trust.

Too adventurous, the Moo Hong (Braised pork belly with black soy, palm sugar, and black pepper) or the Pou nim pad prik Thai (fried soft shell crab with soy, garlic, black pepper and green onion) both make for good eats.

Large wine list with useless "bragging rights" labels.  Good selection of Rieslings.  Inexpensive.

Efficient service.

Small plates meant to be sampled and shared.  Reasonably priced, considering.

Navigate carefully for a great meal.

Next time, light some candles and play Marvin Gaye before you screw me.

I've been here before, but for some reason I decided to give it another chance.  Kind of like that ex-boyfriend who dumps you but then happens to call you out of the blue when his friends are visiting (he wants to show them he's dating someone really cool) and tells you to wear heels and a short dress and then introduces you as his trophy GIRLFRIEND but dumps you AGAIN when his friends fly back home and you end up feeling even WORSE than when he dumped you the FIRST time.  

Phew, you catch that?!

Anyhoo... this is the second time that the hostess wouldn't seat us outside when all of the tables were available.  Pretentious waitstaff, rubbery pizza, wilted salad, tasty bread (but they'll only bring you one piece, so grab a big one from the basket), prices in line with the area but NOT justified by the lack of quality fare.

I should have learned my lesson the first time.

My whole family comes to Dr. Tran and I recently had the pleasure of seeing her myself. The location is perfectly convenient and seeing all the 5 star reviews from reputable Yelpers is a plus!
Dr. Tran's office certainly earns a 5 star review. They are open late until 7pm some nights which is great for people with regular work schedules. They have a large selection of frames and their contact lense pricing is better than Costco. The staff is friendly and very accomodating. I had the pleasure of chatting with Tom, who was a delight and offered me the best deal on my contacts.
Dr. Tran is very knowledgeable and thorough in her exam. She was helpful in answering my questions and concerns;  she even gave me good info on a future laser correction procedure that I'm still getting up the nerve to do (being awake and coherent while looking into a laser beam is not the easiest concept for me to embrace yet). What's great about Dr. Tran is that she also looks ahead to offer you the best solution that takes into consideration factors like your age, your habits and lifestyle. For example, she recommended I under correct one eye so that it doesn't impede on my close up vision possibly reducing future dependancy on reading glasses. I will continue to see Dr. Tran and entrust her to be my co-doctor once I'm ready for Lasik.

Posting so other yelpers know how this place works and have a good time.

1. Come by car.  Fees are added for the taxi and/or limo drivers who bring guest to the Rhino.

2.  Come with locals.  Nevada residents are free.  No local ID, you pay what they want to charge you. Locals might be able to get you in.

3.  Don't flash a roll.  You will get picked up right away by a hostess.  Better to look first and make your choice.

4.   You don't get to see unless you pay.  $20 is the rate for the dance.  Don't get fooled.  

5.  If you reject a hostess, she gets annoyed quick.  IRRITATING.

6.  VIP back room fee is a minimum of $100.  That's all you should expect to pay.  The girls can charge you whatever they like so keep that in mind.  Negotiate first.  You don't want to get in it with a bouncer.

REMEMBER, THE GIRLS DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT YOU COULDN'T ALREADY DO TO YOURSELF.

Follow these tips and you will have a good time.  Oh yeah, the girls are HOT!

Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.

Over the last decade, we've had a few problems with our Lexus cars.  And, now for the rest of the story...

About eight years ago I was driving our five year old RX-300 from Seattle to Chicago, so one of our kids could use it at college.  We were outside of Bismarck, ND when all the lights on the dash lit up warning us that the car was about to fail.  The nearest dealership at that time was in St Paul, MN.  Yeah, I know LOL.

So after calling Lexus for advice, off we drove very nervously to MN.  We arrived safely around 5pm and waited nearly three hours for them to look at the car.  It was confirmed that the RX had some sort of unknown oil sludge build-up in the engine and that the engined needed to be replaced!  Replaced? Eesch!

We were asked various questions on where we had our service work done.  After verifing that we had all of our work done at the dealership in WA state, they offered us a Loaner.  Ummm I said, we're driving on to Chicago.  Not to worry, they would flatbed the car to us when it was repaired and to keep the Loaner.  Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

Now, that story is eight years old and it reminds me of our current experience with our ES.  Seems the NAV & bluetooth link doesn't want to accept the new iPhone.  Yeah, I know, Apple right? LOL. After several attempts by us and the dealer, they are now replacing the entire system. Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

We have owned other cars and have spent lots of $$$ with replair work, but no one backs up their cars like Lexus.  No one. Peace of mind? Priceless!

I've never heard of Filipino-Mexican fusion.  (Filican?  Mexipino?  FiliMex?)  I joined friends Donald and Mark (Donark?  Monald?) here for a nice Friday lunch.

The folks here were friendly and hospitable (Fraspitable? Hofriendly?) when we came in and offered sample tastes of several dishes.  We tried chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, beef mechado and the special, roasted pork.  As in roasted pig.  A whole pig, roasted on site.  In my head I heard Christopher Walken blurt his patented "Wow."

Everything was tasty.  I went with a platter of two meats and garlic rice.  I chose the chicken coconut curry and the pork adobo.  The meats were tender and well sauced.   Savory and aromatic.  Savormatic?  Aromavory?

As we were finishing they brought over a slice of cassava cake, sliced for three.  Very sweet.  (The gesture and the cake.)  When we ordered I had asked if the cassava cake was similar to flan because it looked a bit like flan.  It's not.  It has more depth and texture and substantial vegetable flavor to it.  Good stuff.

I think Karey's gets 4 stars.  This is a place that could take their food to the 5 star level.  All of the dishes were really good but tasted like they were going for a milder, more mainstream version of the full bright flavor potential.  My advice is to keep doing what they are doing, only more.

Tandoori Times

Volume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.  

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."

Gorgeous pool where the mermaids play. It's such an idyllic setting with the cascading waterfalls and calm waters. Add an alcoholic beverage to complete the picture and you're all set. Relax in this beautiful scene or meet some fun people to party with. Anything's fair game in Vegas, after all!

There are plenty of lounge chairs if you just want to kick back and recover from a long night. Grab a towel and catch some sun. Make sure to wear sunblock anytime you're outside in Las Vegas. The desert sun will own you. Guaranteed.

If you've napped long enough, take your drink with you into the pool and meet some highly interesting folks. You know how it is. When everyone's drinking, anyone can become your new friend.

So whether you're seeking the water nymph of your dreams or just have some fun, this is the place to be!

DATE TIP: The huge waterfall may *seem* like a nice romantic idea, but it's NOT romantic to piggyback someone right under the waterfall's force and just stand there forever. Once you get to the other side though, it becomes a private oasis.

Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like "Hello Kitty," "Harajuku Lover," "Shiso Horny," and "Kinki Kooler" just to name a few. My favorite was the "Turning Japanese" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.

Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.

In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with "entertainment" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.

A place that puts turkey, cranberry sauce and dressing (stuffing for non-southerners) on a crusty bun deserves a 4 star or better rating.   Geesus people that's an insane sandwich.  

I had lunch here recently with Rand H, Mike C and Robyn B.  Met Jackie C for the1st time.   

For lunch,  I stuck with the "more of the middle road" and ordered the Capistrami... Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw.  But instead of having mine on a toasty bun, I had mine with a bit of lettuce in a bowl.  A fantastic bunless sandwich and since this particular sammie is quite the messy one, I'm happy I could eat this one with a fork.

For those who love sandwiches, their's come in 9, 12 and 15 in bun sizes.  Uhm yeah... BIG, HUGE and Gigantic.  

I'll definitely return to this place.  I may work up the courage to try the Bobbie, but until then, I'm fine with the Capistrami!

Useless, overpriced GARBAGE!  

 I came in really wanting to buy something, but as I looked around the store and picked up the items, they looked very cheesy and poorly made for the amount of money they were charging.  Novelty items and ugly cheaply made clothing alike.  $100 for a clutch, and when I opened it, the magnetic clasp seemed flimsy and ready to fall off.  It was hilarious.   

But what can I expect,   trash in exchange for money -- that's who the Kardahsian's are anyway, right?? Lol. 

Another thing that I will have to concur with another reviewer.  I did notice that they were selective about who they gave their Kardashian shopping bags to.  If they don't like how you look or don't think you fit into who they're trying to market their store to by carrying their bags, then no Kardashian shopping bag for you, you get a Mirage bag.  They'll gladly take your money, but they don't want you associated with shopping at their store.

I say pass this store.  You'd find cuter, better quality items at the flea market.  And you won't be discriminated against and denied a shopping bag.

After visiting the Neon Museum, I wish I had a time machine to go back to the 1950's and '60's to see what old timey Las Vegas was like. No mega hotels/resorts, no football shaped drinks and no video poker in a bar. This was a time when people actually got dressed up to go to on a Vegas vacation 'cause gambling was a special occasion.

Such a cool exhibit and informative tour - guides take you through a curated maze of old, rusty neon signs (you can look, but don't touch!) and provide some interesting tidbits about Vegas history. As many have mentioned, it does take an hour or so and you must be escorted with an employee... no random wandering.

Plenty of photo opportunities, especially for those who love changing their social media profile pics on the regular. Though I don't think a camera phone could really do this place justice, as the signs are quite impressive and I'd rather take a mental picture to remember. 

And yes, this also doubles as an event space. I can only imagine how cool it looks at night with some of the working signs lit up! 

$18/person if you aren't a local. Worth the cost, as they're a 501(c)3 and your tour ticket is tax-deductible. Plus, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Vegas history.

Oh Lobsta, Lobsta, Lobsta!  

I do luv all things crustacean so you didn't have to drag me here for a lobster roll.  I've actually had some off the food trucks in Cali and really enjoyed them.  So I was eager to try the one's here. 

Combo Lobster roll with Garlic Tater Tots ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#2Lng3Y1DRRiTZgwO36aW_A  They offer 2 sizes medium or large.  I went with a medium and I have to say it had a decent amount of lobster meat in it.  The roll was buttered and grilled up on both sides.  It was perfect meat to bread ratio.  I went with the original flavor with a touch of mayo and lemon.  The menu only listed garlic fries but I like tots so I asked for switch-a-roo and asked for my tots to be married with garlic.

Here is my close up of the lobster seconds before it was consumed http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#yWfRR2jZGPrkV1wMVUNebQ

Ladies there is no pretty way of eating these so just shove it in your mouth and enjoy!  Worry about the mess later LOL!  It can get pretty pricey depending on what you order.  In the end it is lobster meat that your getting. 

Eyes ~ Oh Lobster Meeeeeee!
Nose ~ I smell a hint of garlic from my tots!.
Ear ~ Peeps walking by.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

Walked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of "Dangerous Dilemma" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an "outside drink."  "Would this be a problem?," she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.
The $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away...

Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.

I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the "BLT" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their "Famous Seasoned Fries" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the "Cinnamon Apple Pie" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here.

I was referred to ProtoGym by a good friend and have been extremely satisfied. The gym is owned by the trainer and it is pretty much a one man operation. You are given a scanner key and are able to access the gym 24/7/365. Being that the gym is relatively new (6 months or so) the member base is not huge yet, therefore most of the times I have gone I have had the entire gym to myself. It felt pretty exclusive except the prices are far from it. The gym offers all of the equipment you would need for successful circuit training and cardio. 

The really neat function is the protogym software in conjunction with the gym. When you go in, you go up the the kiosk, scan your key and it brings up your personalized work out. You click for your work out to be generated,  print it out and don't have to worry about what you should be working on that day. The exercises for the day also have instructional 30 sec videos that show you exactly how/what you should be doing. The equipment is well kept and well stocked (medicine balls, mats, boxing bags,  weights, stability balls, balance trainer, cones, high cable stations, etc etc). The website lists in full everything offered at the gym. Mike, the trainer/owner is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and will kick your butt in his boot camp classes. I kind of want to be selfish and not let the word out about this awesome and innovative gym, but at the same time I want him to succeed and stick around.

He offers month to month, no contract memberships, as well as membership options that includes boot camp classes. He doesn't do any third party billing, so when you ask to cancel your membership he will do it without any hassle or headache (I am looking at you 24 hr fitness...).

Over 600+ Review, I'll try and keep mine to the point!

-Box Office located outside in the courtyard, look for the Absinthe Tent
-Two Shows per night, 7:30 & 9:30PM (Dark on Monday+Tuesday)
-Expect to pay a minimum of $100 after all the fees
-No discount at actual box office 
-Discount tickets available at 'Tickets 4 Tonight'; average $80 total
-No entrance into the tent till 5 minutes before the show
-Located on Cesar Palace's ground
-Well ventilated, no worries on freezing or heating up
-9:30PM show ends around 11PM

What makes Absinthe so great is the overall show. The transition with the comedic sketches, burlesque singing, and the circus acts makes this show the most entertaining in Vegas so far! The intimate setting also puts Absinthe a step above all the Cirque Du Soleil Show. 

They do some audience participation in the show, so front row....BEWARE. You'll get what you paid for! I'm not going to go into all the details of the show, just check out the photos and you'll get the general idea.

Photos were permitted, just no flash photography. Absinthe is definitely a must and a show I would recommend; definitely refreshing after all the other shows I've seen in Vegas. Till the next act, ciao!

I'm glad I had the chance to ride the High Roller, but at $21.95 during the day & $36.95 at night, I find it to be too pricey for just a souped up ferris wheel.  I recommend the High Roller as something to take a pic of from a distance, with or w/o selfie.

Shhh! Don't let on to the locals here that you're from outta town. Oh, and definitely don't mention you're from SoCal. Oh...and especially don't burst their bubble by letting it slip that there's a Griffin in LA too. 

Now that you've been warned - have yourself a fabulous, hipstery time with some local Vegas folks. And talk about stiff drinks! Holy moly. I got a vodka and soda...that thing had so little carbonation I could count the bubbles from the teensy splash of soda poured into my glass of vodka. Oh, good times indeed.

Now, I'm not too sure what the gay bar scene is like in Vegas, but if you're in the market for a hipster, 21-30 gay guy or gal, most-likely wearing some ridiculous eyewear...well, you're likely to find your soulmate at The Griffin. Plus, a kickass jukebox and a lounge in the back for even more dancing. 

Oh wait! One more warning for outta-towners...you know that I love me some dive bars, but I totally forgot that a dive in Vegas would be filled with smokey smoke smoke. So grab that gasmask and hide your California license and prepare to have one helluva night.

Quality, authentic, hand pulled noodles and hand cut noodles in the middle of the desert!

If you're on a low carb diet, STOP READING.  Also, this is not for you if your idea of "authentic Asian cuisine" comes from a place that serves general tzo's chicken or beef with broccoli chow mien.  Skip if you enjoy eating rehydrated microwaved noodles from a styrofoam bowl.

This is the real deal.  Extremely glutinous, al dente noodles with just the right amount of surface imperfections to hold the sauce or soup.  Enough, it's just good eats!

The sliced pork and mushroom hand pulled noodles that other yelpers rave about is THE standout dish.  Loads of meaty mushrooms and tender pork.  Very flavorful, not too oily.  The beef noodle soup is also a worthy try.  Fresh herbs, ginger, garlic, chilies, and five spice create a very aromatic base for tender beef, mushrooms, and noodles.

Ultimately, the strong flavors, lack of acidity, and the lack of textural contrast fill you up quick.  Avoid the "eyes bigger than the stomach" syndrome.  Nothing worse than a carb brick in your stomach and a cloying flavor in your mouth for hours.

Note:  They use MSG with no apology.  You've been warned.

Service is OK.  Prices very low.

One of the best kept secrets in Vegas so shhhh, recommended.

Let those punk ass Zombie's try and take over the earth! Because of the Zombie Apocalypse Store, I'll be ready for them!

To be honest, even though the ZAS sells lots of cool Zombie related gear, like Zombie targets, Zombie T-shirts, Zombie repellent and more, this store is more of a shop that will prepare you for a natural disaster. 

They sell things like flashlights, Emergency food rations, knives, tents, canteens, etc, etc. 

The folks who work here are really cool. When we walked in they started asking us if we were equipped to handle a Zombie takeover. Then, after a few minutes of joking they asked us if we were ready if a natural disaster were to occur and if we could survive in our home with no power, water, etc. 

After thinking about it, my wife and I are really are not prepared for a natural disaster. If I lived in the area I probably would purchase a few things from this store just in case a disaster does happen. Too bad a store like this isn't close to my home in Long Beach.

"It's like a jungle sometimes, 
It makes me wonder, 
How I keep from going under..."

hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.

the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacos

but alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.

the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.

4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.

So, it's almost a week later, we're back home, and we're still missing a bag. I understand that sometimes baggage goes missing for a day or two. I wouldn't be quite as cranky about it if it seemed like one singular person we spoke with actually wanted to help us.  

I'm not going to regale you with the gory details of my frustrating hours on the phone (mostly on hold or being transfered/dropped) with the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. 

Nope, instead I'm just going to sum it up with this:
US Air=FAIL

I'm not usually a harsh person, but sometimes, you just have to tell it like it is. 

I really hope that our other bag is found, eventually.  I also hope that US Air will revamp their baggage system so that people working within that system can all have access to the same information and update each other and customers.

Japanese restaurant, Chinese chef.  Vegas style.  

Imagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined, pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.

Small selection of relatively fresh, everyday seafood.  The sushi, AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.

Two standout "raw" fish dishes, the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy, drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapeos and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.

Also noteworthy, the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde, salmon with pico de gallo, and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.

Nobuesque tempura (rock shrimp, king crab, assorted veg and shrimp), all not oily but over battered, masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso, yuzu aioli..

Finally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.

Friendly, off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.

It's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby.

I also found that that they have quite a few flavored vodkas, including pomegranate, so I was excited to try something new.

Again, the Mac and Cheese was SO good... I had two bowls. That's right, TWO bowls. What a pig.

Great UYE here last week.  Friendly staff, but missed some very important details when describing the appetizers to our large group.  We were brought 4 platters at $24.95 each.

----NO BOOZE!!!    ----NO BYOB!!! 

So the "value" part of this restaurant totally sucks.   My combination of the pork something and the mole, which were good but not great, were incredibly small portions for $17.95.  I seriously did not have enough meat in the mole sauce for a single taco. Weak. Beans were average. Rice was tasty, but like another reviewer said I think they used frozen vegetables.

I think the Guacamole was $10.95!

It's kinda a nice place, but the prices are easily 2 to 3 time higher than what they should be.   I'll go to Barrio Cafe and not this place from now on.

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!

People say that variety is the spice for life. I couldn't agree more so that's why I ventured out to Cafe Zupas from my normal rotation.

I decided to get a large make your own salad along with a soda for $9.29 (inclusive of tax). They give you plenty of mixed greens and about four ingredients on the salad. I could probably fit all the ingredients that they gave me on a hot dog. If you stick out your hand and look at your ring finger and pinky that would have been about the volume of chicken in the salad. I may have gotten somewhere between a 1/3 to 1/2 of a hard boiled egg as well. They chop up the cucumber and tomatoes very fine. Maybe a couple of teaspoons of each ingredient.

It's safe to say that I won't be fooled again.  At least I enjoyed this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QtO2KYwVE   (start at 1:14).

Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.

A puff pastry lid tops a "pot" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  

Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.

Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.

For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. 

Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.

Sometimes simple is best.  American Fish delivers.

Family Friendly Bar/Restaurant with a good ole theme...Bacon!

Not EVERYTHING is bacon drenched, so if you are looking for something else, you should still be ok with their long-listed menu.  But for the bacon/fat LOVERS out there, you will get your thirst quenched!

I went with The Bacon Burger ($12.95): 60/40 Beef/Bacon Patty, Croissant Bun, Horseradish and Chive Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Arugula, and Garlic Fries ($1.50 add). Great burger! Super juicy, fatty and messy...just how I like em! Not quite Slaters, but very good, and the Garlic Fries are the MOST garlicky I've had! Vampire worthy for sure!  Yum :)

Also tried The Cure ($13.95): Maple Glazed Beer Braised Bacon on a Toasted Baguette, Fried Egg, Tomato Jam, and Garlic Fries ($1.50 add). This was good, "bacon" was an inch thick cut of pork belly lol...heart attack anyone?? It was very sweet, from the Maple glaze...pretty tasty overall!  I'd still recommend the burger of course ;)

If the burger had a little more zing to it, I think it could possibly push this review to a 5!  Prices are super reasonable and the food is great, just needs a little more somethin to get it to sparkle lol

I'll be back for another!

Quiznos has had a rough time the last couple of years. 

But this location seems unaffected by the problems at corporate and a soft economy which closed one of their stores on nearby Scottsdale Road.

If you are unfamiliar with Quiznos, they make some good toasted sub sandwiches, prepared with better quality meats, cheeses and bread. Yes you'll pay a little extra, in my case $7.19 for a large Turkey Club, but generally they're very good.. 

Another positive are the folks who work here, seem happy and eager. I have always found that as a good gage on how the employees are treated and if they enjoy coming to work.

So Three Stars, "A-OK".  As I mentioned in my Tip, consider joining their eClub for a $2.00 Off coupon and other promotional emails before coming here.

"Wait till you try some of MY sauce?" says the chef to two ladies while standing over a pile of rice shaped like a dude's junk (The balls are even sprinkled with black sesame seeds).  Welcome to Musashi.

Great spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.

The classic teppanyaki "show" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.

Steaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).

Dinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.

Other menu items?  Who knows.  This is a TEPPANYAKI restaurant.  Get your sushi fix elsewhere.

Open till 4am.

Note:  The Travel Channel's "Steak Paradise II" featured Musashi for their use of "imported from Japan Kobe beef".  Since the import ban of 2010 it's  no longer available.

Having lived in California for 15 years I find it funny when a restaurant says it serves California fare. What? Beet salad and seared scallops are only available in California. Warm chocolate cake? Only in the Golden State? Hmmm. Well, what's not funny is how much I enjoyed my food and the attentive and outgoing service we had. And I was delighted at how large the portions were. I was expecting scaled down versions for RW. Kristin S, Rickie and I were here for Arizona Restaurant Week (Ah, c'mon who are we kidding, let's just call it Phoenix Restaurant Week!) and had a fantastic time. My roasted beets were sweet and dee lish. While the sauce with my scallops was a bit too sweet for my tastes, they were cooked perfectly. And as luck would have it, it was half off bottled wines! YAY! Kristin and I sipped a wonderul Sauvignon Blanc that matched my entree perfectly. Rickie's Natural Chicken (WTF? Natural chicken? As oppossed to the chickens with silicon breasts? Now that would be very Californian!) was flavorful but since it was served with the skin on, could have been crispier. Not being a fan of rhubarb I was pretty sure I wouldn't like the cobbler. And. Well. I was right. I made that yucky puckery face you make when you wish you could spit out what you just put in. But I swallowed. Like a lady.

We got a large cheese pizza with banana peppers and sun dried tomatoes as toppings. So good. It was a bit greasy but after blotting that away it was near perfect. some of the best pizza in Vegas for sure. I like the whole gimmick of it being a "secret" too.

Tix 4 Tonight is a must for those wanting to catch impressive discounts on shows, attractions & meals.  Customers can save up to 50% off the premium pricing that Las Vegas attractions demand.  I utilized Tix 4 Tonight to purchase vouchers to Beatles Love, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, Donny & Marie and Flavors buffet at Harrah's.  Once I acquired said vouchers, I just had to go to the box office of the particular show to secure my tickets.  Let me tell you, I scored primo seats for Beatles Love and Donny & Marie.  For Beatles Love, the show is in the round, so good seating is available throughout.  The only catch with Tix 4 Tonight is vouchers can only be obtained either the day of or the day before, since it's a discounter that's attempting to sell unsold tickets.  If you want to make sure you secure tix to a show or you want the very best seats, then I suggest buying them ahead of time through the box office or vegas.com.  However, if you're looking for something to do in Vegas, then I highly recommend visiting one of the many Tix 4 Tonight locations located on the Strip.

The main event of the evening, a seat at Gen-san's easily missed Kabuto, finally arrived and true to the rumors the $80 Yoroi Menu would not disappoint; easily the best deal on fresh sushi in the Vegas area and, with a focus on edomae-sushi plus fish arriving 4-7x per week from Japan (depending on demand,) a truly authentic experience in a city where 'authenticity' is generally questionable at best.

All clean lines and zen, blonde woods and flowers, a small slit window at the entrance and a couple of tables the action here is clearly a seat at the sushi bar and placing oneself in the hands of the itamae in order to bear witness to the incredible knife skills as piece after piece of fish arrives perfect and smooth, the rice fragrant and warm, with ample description of province and the occasional anecdote.  Featuring fresh wasabi, house-made aged soy and creamy miso, plus an extensive sake list and dessert program responsible for the best mille crepe I've had to date my only regret in visiting Kabuto is that I did not book an earlier reservation and order the longer menu; a mistake I'll not make in the future.

Carl's Junior is one of those good fast food places you don't find east of the Mississippi.

One of the surprises with moving to the Valley, was discovering Carl's, Jr.  As with most fast food places, I rarely give higher than three star, because... well...  they're fast food, not Three Star Michelin cuisine.   

But Carl's Jr might be the exception to my rule.  I would offer they are at least  three and half stars on most occasions we've dinned here.  We would recommend any of the burgers, but also the Chicken Strips.  They are flavorful and as good as any we've had, including the Colonel's and Popeye's.  

We would also recommend the Malts and Shakes.  They use real milk and make it fresh before your eyes.  Nice!  Also, be on the lookout for coupons in your Sunday paper.  Most times there's buy one, get one free.

HONEY TOAST!!!  Its plain and delish!  It had been 3 yrs since I last had one here and was eager to stuff my face with some yummy goodness.

But first we decided to get a little bit of good in the tummy.  It was 11pm when we got here so we tried to keep it light.

Wasabi Ika (squid) ~ it was fresh squid in a wasabi sauce garnished with pickled daikon.  It was very refreshing!

Agedashi tofu ~ I luv this dish and luv making it at home!

Ika butter ~ Sauteed squid in butter and onions.

Asparagus bacon and Gizzards (sunagimo) ~ Two yakitori that I often get when its available.

Okra Natto ~ 2 of my fave slimy food hell yeah!!!

Sake flight ~ From Ginjo, Junmai, Daiginjo all were pretty good tasting. 

Honey Toast ~ Hmm what can I say...... Its damn good so you have to try it.  Toast, Honey and Ice Cream!  Yum Yum!

This place is way off the strip but worth going to to.  Its open late so you can get some good grub here!  I still like the izakaya in my hood but this place is a good spot in sin city!

Eyes ~ My eyes are on the Honey toast!
Nose ~ I smell yummyness!
Ear ~ Its a late night but still pretty busy and lively!

When Mimi's was bought by the French company LeDuff America, Inc. ("LDA") a US based subsidiary of Groupe LeDuff SA, headquartered in Rennes, France over eighteen months ago, I thought wow, finally they'll fix this place up. D'oh

If you don't know Le Duff America, their brands in North America and France include Brioche Doree, Caf Del Art, La Madeleine Country French Caf, Bruegger's Bagels, Timothy's Coffee and Michel's Baguette.  We fondly remember La Madeleine from living in other parts of the US and had such high hopes for our dinner here last evening

So... what Yelp rating would you give a french themed restaurant that forgets to add the bacon and cheese to their Quiche Lorraine?  

That's right. No Gruyre, or even Swiss cheese.  Just a fluffy egg mixture in a crust shell (see photo). I could go on and discuss the absent-minded, exceptionally slow service or a variety of other issues. 

Let just say I do not enjoy writing One Star reviews, and leave it at that.  

They do deserve at least one star for their delicious muffins.  Otherwise, it would be a zero. Sorry!

Downtown Pizza Lounge is a nice place to pop into if you're looking for a quick slice of pizza.  The basic set-up is that there are 6-8 varieties of pizza daily, and once you choose the type you it is reheated in the oven for you.  On the day we stopped in, the fresh pies were coming out of the oven so we were able to have fresh pizza, versus the reheated version.  Slices were good, and they have a few different lunch specials to choose from.  If we had gotten slices that had been reheated, I don't think they would have held up so well.   So like most other things in life, timing is everything.

The menu is fairly limited, with buffalo wings and house salads being the only other options.  But if you're in need of a quick pizza fix, go for whichever variety is coming fresh out of the oven and you'll leave pleased.  Overall, closer to 3.5 stars.  Three if you get reheated, four if you catch them fresh.

For those that are too cheap to pay a $15-20 dollar tab for Serendipity's dine in menu, there is an alternative, somewhat inexpensive To Go menu. Here you will find hot dogs, pizzas, among other things, including their famous "Frozen Hot Chocolate."

For $8.50, the Frozen Hot Chocolate was rather unimpressive. Although the price isn't too bad upon comparing it with other places on the strip, it just doesn't make sense to order a cup of chocolate powder, whole milk, and ice for that high of a price. Knowing that I could have refilled my Fat Tuesday margarita for $9.00 made buying a Frozen Hot Chocolate without splitting it impossible. 

With this in mind, it's my recommendation that you split this drink with a friend or boo. This way you'll get the chance to try this famous drink without feeling too jipped. 

Happy drinking in Vegas! (of Frozen Hot Chocolate, OF COURSE.)

Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Flour. (BSEF) That's all you need to bake your basic cupcake.

But what if you're flying from SFO to LAS to visit your peeps, and you not only don't have any B,S,E or F, you have no time? You call The Cupcakery for a quickie delivery of some of the finest cupcakes east of the Cali border!

While cupcake delivery is a big, pricey splurge (almost $70 for a dozen... half of which is delivery charge), it' well-worth seeing the look of "Ohhh, man that's one good yummy piece of cake" on everyones face as they take a bite of these moist-caked & creamy-topped gems. I was impressed!

Plus, cupcakes are a delightful alternative to flowers, don't you think?

For the record, the Red Velvet was really good, and while it's usually my favorite, I really loved the Vanilla, too!  

It's nice to know the greater Vegas area has a place like the Cupcakery handy... especially since it's so close to my peeps!

Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  

Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

I had a really fun dinner here on Saturday night with four girlfriends. This is the perfect spot for dinner before a night out. We shared several things but the highlights were the seabass, the vegetarian dim sum, the sweet and spicy lobster and the chive noodles. Skip the truffle duck. It was a huge disappointment. 

Cocktails were sweet and strong and the wine we ordered was great. Our server, Brian, was excellent. The macaroons were surprisingly good, albeit a bit random for a Chinese restaurant. 

After dinner head to the lounge and then the club. Sure to make for a great Vegas evening!

Bachi Burger...I'm a huge fan. This is one of my favorite places for gourmet burgers. 
My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth. 

We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries. 

Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.

The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead.

A taste of the old country; yep, New York City circa 1890.  The ultimate expression of what many have come to know as Italian or rather I-talian (emphasis on the I and meaning no disrespect) food in the US.  It's origins in Naples, but long since corrupted for American taste and bounty.  The Italian spirit and passion for sharing good food lives on.

Rao's is a fun place to mangia!  Example one, ginormous meatballs the size of your fist.  Flavorful, Perfectly cooked, tender, balls bathed in a hearty red sauce.  A great blend of fatty beef, pork, and lean veal the right amount of breadcrumb filler.  Example two, spaghetti alla Bolognese, a pile of noodles hidden under a thick meaty, flavor charged sauce.

Classic starters.  Baked clams, rich with butter and crisp breadcrumbs, dried herbs and a kiss of lemon; the fritto misto (calamari, shrimp, cod, and zucchini) a slightly crisp, slightly oily, aggressively seasoned; the sauted mussels, sweet and tender sauted in butter then quickly steamed in white wine and garlic.  No complaints.

Classic mains.  Outstanding veal chop served smothered with Rao's classic sauce of mildly spicy, sweet cherry peppers.  Subtle flavor of tender veal along side the clean, pepper flavor and zesty tomato sauce.  It heightens the sweetness of the veal.  Win!  Veal not your thing?   The same sauce tops a tender grilled shell steak (Steak Pizzaiola) and a thick, juicy, double cut pork chop.  The Ossobuco, delicious.  Well braised, tender without being stringy.  A good portion of bone marrow a nice touch.  Finally "Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken; charbroiled marinated in a lemon olive oil mixture and finished in the same.  Tart, sweet, bitter, classic.

Portions are large.  

Very good wine list focusing on Italy.  Typical high Vegas resort pricing.

Service is very friendly and efficient.  Exactly what you would expect from an I-talian restaurant from NYC.  Well done.

OK people. Let's face it. If it was called Cleveland Market, nobody would go. But throw in a trendy city's name and "Oh, it must be fantastic." After all Boston does have the Celtics. And they gave us Kristin and Jared. But can they pull off fast food. Yea, kinda sorta. It's nice to have a fast food option that is a "square meal." No burgers or fries. Roasted chicken, that holiday green bean casserole everyone loves but is too afraid to admit they eat it, mashed taters (gravy sucks ass though)...all pretty descent. We even tried the sirloin there, cooked medium rare, but WOW, it was like $12! So, I'm sure it's not even a Boston based company. And we all know it's nothing like a market. But three stars for dependable, un-bunned food! Oh. The cornbread? Seriously, it's "crack" good. I'd knock over school children just to get an extra one. As they say in Boston, "cheers." I know. Lame. Now, go get some cornbread!

IMPECCABLE.  Food, service, staff, ambiance...everything was just impeccable.

We chose the 6 course dinner each and we were there from 5:30pm to 10:30pm.
-The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate.
Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread.
-Soup: Delicate tofu velout with lemon zest on warm seaweed gele, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor.
-Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage
-1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree
**after the 1st main course, I was pretty full.
-2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out.
**we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by.
-Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference.
-Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it.
-Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different.
-Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.

Before we left, they gave us a gift bag with the menu, rosemary bread, and a booklet of Joel Robuchon Restaurant, with Chef''s bio, menus, etc.

Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand has to be the #1 Restaurant on my list.

I met the fine ladies of Yuri's popcorn a few years back at a local festival after seeing their sign.  (Anything that says "popcorn" draws my attention immediately; it's one of my favorite treats.)

I was pleased to see that Yuri's opened a storefront at Hilton Village a few months ago and I finally popped in (literally) yesterday to check it out.    The store is adorable - colorful, fun, and filled with all kinds of sweet and savory treats.  Talicia couldn't have been friendlier, and she was extremely patient as another customer and I both took it all in, sampling flavors, etc...

I ended up purchasing an XL bag of caramel corn for the super bowl party I'm heading to later today, as well as some yogurt covered craisins and red velvet chocolate covered cherries.  All of this for about $20 - not bad!

They were out of kettle corn yesterday, so call ahead if you're in the mood for a particular flavor just in case... and if you're in the area, pop on in and check this place out!

Despite the warning from a Yelp friend I had two cupcakes here.  One I really liked, but the other one not so much.

Actually, I came about this place not knowing it was the one star wonder that Janice C had previously reviewed.  I was headed toward the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram when one of my friends spotted it.  The store was about 10 minutes away from closing so I stepped in and purchased two cupcakes at $3.75 a piece.

Most of the cupcakes here are decorated in glitter.  That alone was enough to turn away my two friends who probably thought I was kidding when I voiced the desire to actually walk in for a cupcake.

Still in my San Francisco Giants-loving mode I selected The Julius (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-pN44P-_PjRpcj4Rk2wMOg?select=os6ho_qd-sCDWrHQ7sFOKg) with its swirl of orange and vanilla buttercream on top of an orange and pineapple cake, and a Grasshopper (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-pN44P-_PjRpcj4Rk2wMOg?select=sfW64iixXLiMb9hthriMCQ) because I love the combination of mint and dark chocolate.

The characteristics of the two cupcakes were completely different from one another.  It was almost like they were created by different bakers.  The cupcakes were both dome shaped on top so the amount of frosting on each cake looked like more than there actually was.

The Julius was just bad.  While the cake wasn't too sweet, almost buttery in fact, it was a bit dry and had little to none orange or pineapple flavor.  There were itty, bitty bits of substance in the cake that I'll assume was pineapple.  The super sweet buttercream had no orange flavor either but tasted somewhat chemical like with an odd, bitter aftertaste.  My friend suggested they used actual foil to create the glitter and that was the taste I was experiencing.  I won't buy into that suggestion, but he may have had a point.

The Grasshopper, however, was very good.  The dark chocolate cake was super moist, super chocolaty and not very crumbly.  The mint chocolate buttercream tasted great but it was much thinner than the orange-vanilla buttercream.  As soon as I bit into the cupcake the mint chocolate buttercream began to roll off of the cake.  The shiny green glitter on this cake had no chemical aftertaste.

They were definitely two very different cupcakes.  Could be this is the Jekyll and Hyde of cupcake boutiques.

The four of us came here for lunch and had a great time.

Spinato's has a nice ambiance as you enter and you will notice a great many Chicago posters, such as Illinois Central, Chicago Worlds Fair and B&W photos of the bridges crossing the Chicago River. Nice!

The food is equally good. The four of us each ordered different pizzas but really enjoyed the flavor.  This not your classic Chicago deep dish place, so you might be surprised by the thin crust cut into squares.  We really enjoyed it, and reminded us of the Edwardo's chain.  http://www.edwardos.com/

The pizza also has that sweet tomato sauce they served in St. Louis.  My friend Marvin A. is right, "it's over the top" sweet.  And it will surprise you when you first try it, but it works well.  In St Louis, they use Provel cheese which has a more buttery and creamy taste.  But here the manager Tim assures me they use mozzarella.  Still, it was very good.  

We enjoyed Spinato's and will be back.

Enjoy!

We order the 20" cheese pizza for $14.11 last night for dinner and thought it was very good.

Giant Rustic Pizza is located in the Safeway shopping area, next to after school learning center Kumon and Leslie Pool supplies.  This is a take-out only store that has seating outside.  Besides selling whole and half pies, Giant Rustic sells by the slice, along with salads and artisan breads.  The latter is mainly for the lunch crowd, but it seems to have attracted some of the parents waiting for their kids at Kumon.

The pizza is a very large twenty inch pie that is tasty.  The smaller 14" pies are called Large.  Although it is a thin crust, the bread is very chewy.  Our family of three thought is was a little too chewy, but that is a matter of taste. The dough they use seems above average, while the pizza sauce was not seasoned very much.  The light dusting of cheese on top was just enough to cover the pie.

Compared to the other pizza places within a few miles of this location, Giant Rustic's is closer to NYPD, than Ray's or Corleone's in terms of style.  NYPD tends to be chewier of the three.

We liked the pizza and all the energy and extras the new owners bring.  The prices seem in line -- somewhat less than Ray's and NYPD; but more than Corleone's for a similar sized pizzas. As I've mentioned, the 20" Giant Rustic Pizza is $12.95, while the 14" Large Rustic Pizza is $8.95. Additional toppings are $1.75 each for the Giant and $2.50 each for the Large. All prices are before AZ sales tax.

Giant Rustic also serves sandwiches that are made with their Artisan bread for $7.95.  They include Chipotle Turkey Slaw, BMT, Tuscan Veggie and Italian Bird (Turkey).

In the case next to the counter, they sell Giant Salads for $8.95, with names like Sonoran Chicken, Mediterranean, Italian Kitchen, California Dreamin and The All American. They all looked good, so I'll be back at some point for lunch.  So Three Stars, "A-OK".

Pork Belly. Smoked Salmon and Creme Fraiche. It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and "wa la"..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And "BAM" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review. 

We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.

My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The "corn cakes" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?

I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous! 

Undeniably named after all the brick walls, Brick also had a modern, fresh feel. When I think of Brick I think of lick. As in finger lickin' good. Can't wait to return!

For my favorite person in the world's sake, I wanted to write a raving review of this place. Sorry Christina P, I just cannot do it. 

Honestly, not one thing impressed me. In fact, I did not particularly care for my three cheese omelet. The hash browns are pre-made with bacon, so I could not order them being a vegetarian. The pancakes were really thick, and I only like thin things. 

The outdoor patio is nice. Unfortunately it was super windy the day we went. The prices are relatively reasonable. 

It's not good, it's not bad. I'm sure I would eat there again if I was in the area and needed to eat really bad, but I wouldn't make the trip up there again.

Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!

My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.

You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.  

There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.  

There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort.

Ok, I'm upgrading this Sandwich joint to 5 Stars.....why?  Here's why:

I stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.

After a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14" bad boy in this 'Wich!

They deserve the 1 Star bump.

Will I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!

I'll make it simple.  Come for the food, and stay to shop.  Or, come here to shop, and stay for the food!  Either way, you cannot go wrong!

Their home made Italian sausage sandwich is $6.85 and deliecious; while their equally yummy Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is $7.50. Both are great!  

But if you come, stay & shop in their imported Italian foods section. Their meats & cold cuts are outstanding!!! Try the Capicolla at the deli counter.  It costs only $8.00 for a pound and is much better than the Boars Head brand.  They also have a decent wine selection of Barolos and Chiantis, though a bit pricier than Total Wine or BevMov.

We came here to pickup some Italian delicacies recently and stayed for lunch and glad we did!

Enjoy!

Viva Elvis was entertaining, but probably the worst Cirque du Soleil show I've seen. It's probably because I'm not a huge fan of Elvis and this isn't your typically inspiring Cirque show. It's more of a tribute show and the enthusiasm over him from the performers never felt genuine or something the crowd joined. The same way I feel about Elvis is the probably the same way our kids will feel about a Michael Jackson or Lady Gaga tribute show in 30 years.

As for the show itself, there are a few lively numbers and a few forced. The addition of performers to some of the numbers doesn't really match the flow or theme very well at all. Two aerial acrobats on a huge metal guitar in the sky were plain boring, but the gang of superheroes in costumes jumping around on trampolines was fun. A bit that didn't fit was some cowboys/cowgirls with lassos and one of the juggling spinning tops duo dropped the things 2-3 times. An uber-strong pole dancer is impressive, but didn't fit the vibe of the show. The band did rock. One guy on drums really loves his job. I'm jealous.

If you are a fan of Elvis you need to go see this show soon because it is being replaced in the Fall with another Cirque du Soleil show. Of course, if you are a fan of Elvis, you've probably already seen this show or medicare doesn't pay for the trip. My point is go and go soon. Before you or the show are gone. If you are a Cirque du Soleil fan just go see one of the half dozen others in Vegas even if its one you've already seen.

This is the kind of place where you wait 2 hours to get in and then enter to an empty dance floor where a 40 year-old Guido is grinding on his 17 year-old daughter/girlfriend to R. Kelly's "Feeling on yo' Booty".  They were lost in the magic of R. Kelly's sweet, sexy sounds and I was lost in the magic of their bizarre, anti-rhythmic grinds.  Oh also, the dude was sporting an obvious boner.  That was his song, for real, no doubt.

What I'm really trying to say here is, it's totally worth the wait.

You can get free passes most nights by either being a non-repulsive girl or hanging out at the exit to "Le Reve".  At the end of the show, tramped out "reps" from the club hand them out to people as they leave.  Table service is pretty much mandatory but you can just sit down at the end of an empty booth and easily freeload.  What else?  Oh. TERRIBLE djs.  I'm talking I heard a dance mix of the Beach Boys, "Kokomo".  You know the one Uncle Jesse played the drums on?  I know you know what I'm talking about.  Don't front.  There is only one thing worse than the original Kokomo and that is Star Jones' naked.  The dance mix is a close second worst.

Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  

Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! 

Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)
with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. 

Happy Eats!

Beware I got robbed at the Westin Casuarina.

My Fiance and I were awakened at 6:30AM to a maid unannounced in our room facing away from us toward the dresser. She was startled and asked if we need anything from housekeeping. We said no. Housekeeping came back about 8:30 and knocked this time.

I found it strange that a maid entered the room at 6:30 and didn't knock, called down to the front desk and they gave me a 12 dollar credit. When I was getting ready to check out that day I noticed my wallet and all my cash was gone from the same dresser that maid was standing over. Reported to the front desk who notified security and filled out a report. 

Security shift supervisor Terry was a really good guy. Investigated the swipe history of the door lock as well as housekeeping staff for that night. The 2 maids on staff that shift did not match the description of the woman that was in our room at 6:30AM. Turns out the door wasn't working properly and didn't close all the way. The woman didn't work for the Westin and he confirmed that we had been robbed. 

Here is the suspicious part. The woman had the same uniform as the other housekeepers which my Fiance got a good look at and gave a perfect description of the woman (They refused to review video surveilence). Second, our room was on the 12th floor toward the end of the hallway. She knew exactly where to go. If she wasn't a current employee she most certainly knew our door didn't work properly so she worked there before or a current employee was in on it. 

I got a call from the director of security and an email from the GM threatening to sue me for this review saying there was nothing wrong with thier door and saying I "Declared war against the property by posting this review before giving them a chance to investigate (I gave them a week with no call)'. They have opted to deny any responsibilibilty or the fact they have a security issue, instead victimizing me further and questioning the validity of the incident saying that there was no proof it happened other than mine and my fiancee's statements. So unprofessional.

We all enjoyed our dinner of albacore, yellowtail and salmon sushi, chicken yakisoba, beef teriyaki, a spicy tuna and philly roll, and red snapper sashimi with olive oil, black pepper and green onions.  The friendly, helpful staff was also a plus.  I know this wasn't a very descriptive review, but I'm about to be called to a poker table!

"Time to make the Donuts!"  "America runs on Dunkin!"   I just love TV jingles.

We have been coming to this Dunkins since it first opened nearly three years ago. The family who owns the franchise works very hard and is customer friendly. The coffee is very good and it doesn't have that burnt taste like SBUX.  On most days, they give the green mermaid a real run for her money and mine. 

On the downside, the coffee sometimes can be either too strong or too weak.  I'm assuming it has to do with employees pulling the coffee from the urn too early when the Drive-Thru backs up. But otherwise, it's the same great Dunkin experience you would expect in the Midwest or New England.

Also, if you sign up for their email blasts, you will receive early notices of sales and discounts.  Recently, they had a special of two one pound bags of any of their coffees for only $12.99. Nice!

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

Tube steaks.  Yes, tube steaks!

Here are some fun facts, or maybe urban legend.  Babe Ruth was reported to have once ate 12 hot dogs & 8 bottles of soda between games of a double header. He was rushed to the hospital after the game.  What a surprise, right?  

Al Capone's favorite food was???  Anyone?  Bueller?   Nathan's Coney Island!  What no Vienna Beef?  Today, Chicago's O'Hare sells more than 2 million hot dogs a year.  Now I am sure these dogs are Vienna Beef!

I bring this up, because about a year ago SONIC decided to broaden their hot dog menu, with four new dogs: All American, Coney Island, Chicago and New York.  This year they've added a 1/4 pound Footlong to their lineup of Tube Steaks.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/MenuSection/coneys-hot-dogs

Admitted, I haven't been an SONIC aficionado up until now.  But, a "shout out" to my friend Jennifer W and her family, who must be considered the unofficial Queen of SONIC!  How do you stay so thin?

I was willing to give their new menu items a try.  First the bad news, these aren't Nathan's Famous, Hebrew National, or Vienna Beef.  They aren't even Oscar Mayer!  But, for $3.99 for a 1/4 pound footlong hot dog and Tater Tots, they're not bad.  And, a lot better than Der Wienerschnitzel!

BTW, the  World Record for hot dog eating is 68 set by Joey Chestnut at Nathan's Famous in Coney Island.  It was reputed that former Champ, Takeru Kobayashi ate 69 at a nearby location.  Ugh!~

Man, oh man. You've got game if you shop here. If I were a guy, I would buy my entire wardrobe from Stitched. A combination of classic and contemporary, suiting and street - this is how a man with swag dresses!

The store itself is the ultimate man cave. There's a billiard table in the back, flat screen tvs on ESPN and even a whisky lounge with Macallan scotch lockers to rent. There are also several cool choppers worked into the decor. There's an on-site tailor stitching up sharp suits too, personalized with your name if you'd like. Probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail servers.

Price points are really reasonable. A lot of the coats and blazers that I liked were around $250. You'll find ready to wear brands like George Esquivel, Jacks & Jokers, Rag & Bone, Cr8tive Recreation, Louis Stewart and Psycho Bunny.

And girls, the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile too.

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

How did we ever live without Netflix?  Seriously, how did we do it?  Every now and then I still hear someone say they don't have Netflix and I'm like, "What?!?!".  How is that even possible?

Thanks to Netflix we now have this great new word ....  "binge-watching."  I've become so spoiled with being able to watch episodes of a television series back-to-back-to-back that it drives me nuts now to actually watch a show one episode at a time while it's airing.  When one episode ends..... I want the next one...  like NOW!  LOL

In case you've been living under a rock (I don't judge, I live under one pretty frequently), let me briefly tell you about Netflix.  It's really cheap - $8 a month.  Stream movies & television shows onto your tv via a smart tv or a Playstation, or a smart bluray player.  Stream them to your computer or ipad.  Easy as pie.  There are thousands of movies (they have really good ones now too) and entire television series (popular ones).  If you don't have Netlix, GET IT!  

They also have their own original series now too like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black.  Both shows are AWESOME!

I heart you, Netflix!  You are the wind beneath my wings!

Great place to sober up in between trips to and from the bar. I have eaten here a great many times after embarrassing myself and others at Body English. This time we ordered 2 plates of the buffalo wings, which were some of the best I have ever had, and fries. Check totaled about $25, and the service was super fast and friendly. Totally low key and nothing to really rave about, but if you find yourself in the Hard Rock and need something to nosh on, and don't want to spend a fortune this is your place.

Within my first hour at Beacher's, I saw:

- A woman with the biggest boobs I'd ever seen crush beer cans, a watermelon and 3 wooden boards with her massive chest.  
- Midgets attached to a harness flying over the club delivering bottles to tables 
- A girl puking into her friend's hand as they were sprinting out of the club (true friendship)
- To my shock and surprise, my wife being excited to see Pauly D (is it 2010 up in here?)
-Lots and lots of confetti

It's a club without a dance floor.  If you're not getting bottle service, you're kind of screwed since there isn't really anywhere to hang otherwise.  It basically turned into a sea of humanity around 1am.  The music was mainly 90's hip hop/R&B with some splashes of EDM.

So the DJ rocks out for about 15 minutes and then there's a "show" which ranges from midget wrestling to magic to a Pee Wee Herman impersonator and then it goes back to the DJ.  Most of the "shows" weren't that great.  I felt like most of them actually killed the momentum of the party.  Everyone is up on their feet jamming out to a fun tune, then they stop the music and everyone has to sit down to watch the show.  

I think people might have loved this stuff 10-12 years ago when Jeff Beacher first gained notoriety for his traveling band of freaks but not when Rose Rabbit Lie has stepped up this kind of game to a whole new level.  The midget bottle delivery was still damn funny though.

So kids, if you've been following along at home, you know Uncle Georgie thinks most fast food places can only strive for a 3 Star rating or worst. 

Uniformity at fast good places in my opinion make it impossible to offer a Four Star, or Eccck... a Five Star rating. Sorry, Yum Brands!  

But this isn't a ghetto location and the employees aren't brain dead. On the contrary, they're all very nice and friendly. Especially Mallory up front and Becky the Manager who went out of their way. Nice!

As for the food, it's okay. The Tacos were good, as for the cheese Pizza Hut pizza, while being slightly undercooked it was also A-Okay. 

BTW, I had no problems getting a cup for water. So that must have been an isolated incident the other reviewers had on their visit. 

So Three Stars, A-Okay

Miss Sixty offers up unique takes on denim and other casual ware - with their sassy cuts.

Though their stuff is pricey, and you may have to endure trying on a good number of different sizes, since many of their jeans have strange cuts and are made from varied material - you can get a personal guarantee that once you find the right Miss Sixty piece - you will want sixty more of them.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the current Miss Sixty collection is that they're fashion forward and are bringing back overalls. They've added stretch to them, made them short and bootylicious, and injected some 'tude into them. Mark, the guy helping us at this specific Miss Sixty was extremely personable, helpful, and outgoing. He went out of his way to check in with each of us to see if we were interested in trying stuff on, and recommended that we check out the Miss Sixty outlet nearby, and extended his family and friends discount to us.

Unfortunately the cute pair of booty-alls that I tried on, were far too expensive for me and due to length, I could probably only wear them in Vegas, but it's reassuring to know, as an overalls collector - that there's a fashion line just as excited about straps attached to pants as I am.

I just undertook a tour of ALL the porn shops in Vegas -- all 30! And I am here to tell you, at the end of my research...

...this store is the Best of Las Vegas! Adult Superstore is a chain with multiple locations, but this one is the best A.S.S. in town (even better than *MY* ASS, LOL). 

On a practical level, the place is right off the freeway, with discreet parking in the back of the building, out of sight of prying eyes. It is clean, well-kept and feels safe.

Two stories, huge selection, reasonable prices (better than Deja Vu's prices, for sure). Two-screen theater and arcade upstairs for those who like to jerk it in semi-public. Amazing selection of rubber vaginas and creepily life-like masturbators ("20 pounds of pussy!")...Mexican pocket pussies...giant dongs...cringe-inducingly-circumferenced buttplugs...

I could go on and on, but it would be like trying to describe the contents of the Library of Congress. Futile!

You must be 18 to enter, which is a real shame....because instead of Bar Mitvah-ing and Quinceanera-ing our teens, plying them with useless shit like Last Dolls and wristwatches, a MUCH MORE PRACTICAL rite of passage would be to take them here and buy them a dildo/pocket pussy. I mean, we want to keep the teenage pregnancy rate down, right?!?!?!?

October 15, Florida stone crab season OPEN!  Crab lovers rejoice!

Why?  Simple; sweeter than an lobster, tender, juicy, never stringy meat.  Dip them in a tangy mustard concoction and it's fireworks in your mouth.

The facts:
- Available October 15 - May 15.
- Sold by size (medium, large, jumbo, colossal), price increases with size.
- Size matters for texture not sweetness.  Buy the largest you can afford.
- 2013 harvest starting at the lowest in history.  Astronomical prices ($12/claw large, $25/ claw jumbo).

For other menu items, stick to basics; KISS.  Great place for a casual, shared meal with friends.  Solid preparations for grilled lobster tails, steamed jumbo Alaskan king crab legs, classic oysters Rockefeller, and pan seared diver scallops.  The colossal lump crab cake excellent, moist, sweet.  Almost all crab with lumps sticking out in all directions.  Pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  

Good selection of steaks.  Two grades, USDA choice Angus and USDA prime.  All prime cuts are bone in.  Cuts are gently trimmed leaving some of the outer fat in tact.  Old school, fat is flavor style.   Even grilling and cooked to temperature.  It's beef, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

Diverse side meant to be shared.  The grilled tomatoes are the perfect foil for the stone crabs.  Tart, acidic, blistered and  just warmed through.  

Save a little room for dessert.  Home made key lime pie.  They are known for it.  One of the best examples I've ever had.

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Whites perfectly target the clean seafood flavors from Spain, France, Italy and New Zealand.  Modest (2x-2.5x retail), Vegas resort pricing.

Casual, friendly, efficient service.

Seven sinful months in Sin City never tasted so good.

I'm a book lover! Or hoarder, depending upon your point of view. LOL. So Half Price Books is a nice place for me to browse for some used books.

I also have an allergy to molds and dust that tends to limit my time in places like this. My family finds this amusing of course. But, this store isn't too bad on my sinuses and selection is pretty good. Prices are also good and the staff is very helpful. Though admitedly they get busy at times and there are only a few employees who work here. So be patient. 

Besides Half Priced Books, both the Phoenix and Mesa locations of Bookman's have a nice selection. They also do a big business of buying back your books. 

The Book Bin over on Via Linda and 90th, though small has a good selection of paperbacks and is family run. A plus in my opinion.

So if you like to read, I would add each of these places to your list for a visit.

Having just returned from Italy, I was excited to try Parma; very high yelp ratings, a video explaining how they are so authentic, a passionate chef.  Grab a couple of hungry poker buds, order a ton of food and...

Papardelle Bolognese - sheets of perfectly cooked hand made pasta drowned in a thick, meaty, sweet and acidic Bolognese drizzled with olive oil.
Me:  "What a waste of really good pasta. It's drowned in sauce".
Them:  "This is great.  Lots of meat".

Shrimp Fra Diavolo - Large, sweet, properly cooked shrimp with a spicy aribata sauce on pasta with broccolini.
Me:  "Why are these on the same plate?  Primi, secondi, and contorno served together?"
Them:  "Everything taste so good together"

Fiori di zucca (Tuscan classic, batter coated, deep fried zucchini flowers) with marinara sauce?  
Me:  "What the?  Marinara sauce?  It's supposed to be served plain so you can taste the sweet, vegetal flower and enjoy the richness of the oil and crunch of the coating".
Them:  "Man, these are so good.  The more sauce the better".

Authentic Italian? No way!  What's wrong with calling it Italian STYLE cuisine?  Don't misunderstand, I think the food is excellent. Market driven menu that constantly evolves.  Outstanding Italian inspired sandwiches.  The Bologna with a great imported mortadella, provolone and drizzle of red wine vinaigrette that brings out the sweetness of the mortadella and milkiness of the cheese; Excellent.  The Campania  with fresh mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, fresh tomato, and a balsamic vinaigrette; a vegetarian's delight.

Good, friendly service.  Trattoria wine list, well chosen simple wines at reasonable prices.

Them:  "Are you enjoying yourself?"
Me:  "Heck yeah!"  Living life, having a loud, jovial argument about food, kickin it with good company.  Maybe this place is more Italian than I thought.

Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.

From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)

Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*

Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!

Today I had an appointment for a "cake tasting" (for the wedding) with Julia Baker Confections.  I had no expectations going in and didn't really think too much about a cake at all prior to today.  I didn't do any research, I just went with the flow.  Jared opted not to participate, so it was just me, my mom, and our wedding planner.  

I was super impressed from the moment i set foot in Julia's office.  Not only did Julia herself greet us at the door, but the cakes on display were like pieces of art!  I learned about her business as I admired the cake creations and luxury chocolates that surrounded me.  Not only was everything incredibly breathtaking to look at, but I didn't take one bite of anything that I didn't absolutely love!

(Yes - the wedding diet was on hiatus during my visit with Julia today!)

I sampled the passion fruit chocolate and it was amazing.  My mom commented that the caramel truffle she chose was like an orgasm in her mouth!  Then it was on to the cakes: we had the white traditional cake with raspberry gelee and swiss meringue buttercream filling and american buttercream frosting, the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache filling and chocolate ganache frosting, and the red velvet cake with sweet cream cheese filling and american buttercream frosting.  OMG - divine!  All of it! (And I don't even consider myself a 'cake person.')

I won't say which one my favorite was but I will say that Jared loved the same one I did when I brought him samples later in the day.  Our guests are in for a real treat...

Since our meeting, I did some research only to learn that Julia's sweet creations have garnered her notoriety as the "Chocolatier to the Stars" and singer/songwriter Alicia Keys has called Julia "breathtakingly talented." Among the many celebrities Julia has made chocolates for are Bono & U2, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Aniston, and Britney Spears.  None of this surprises me, other than not understanding how Julia keeps her girlish figure while she's surrounded by sugar and amazing fresh ingredients 24/7!

I am so excited for Julia to create our wedding cake!  If you're looking for a custom creation made with passion, check out Julia Baker Confections.

EDC 2012 - I was a virgin to the scene, but after a taste, I just want MOAR ;)

Yes, I went on Saturday when they shut down early due to unsafe wind speeds, but IDGAF. Shit was CRAY. Women in the skimpiest of skimpy "clothing" (myself included), happy, feel good music, and bright flashing lights. GAHDEEENG it it was freaking FABULOUS.

I will say that keeping company that is either open minded to the type of music or at least open to enjoying the experience is key... because no one wants a killjoy when you're doing that love-peace-and-dance thing, amirite?

To be honest, I never thought I'd like this kind of music either, but don't be "that" hip hop prude. Step outside of your comfort zone and try a little something different... even if only to catch a glimpse of beautiful people in neon tutus and well positioned pasties. Life's about the experience, so get out. And EXPERIENCE IT. You may hate it or end up liking it after all. Either way, you'll never forget it.

As for the production value? Top notch. Insomniac knows how to roll out the extravagant stages and pyrotechnics, yo. I'm going to have to check out the midway and hop on that carousel for sure next year. Mmmm, see you all there in 2013? ;D

As one of my fave English bands, ABC says, "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"...hurts...but in a good way. Like a naughty spanking. Not a big toe contusion hurt. First off, this place smelled delightful, like vanilla and lavender with a little Nag Champa thrown in...no weird old Auntie's closet smell here! We were greeted by a young Carol Burnett look alike which is awesome! Especially since Carol Burnett grew up in Hollywood and went to Hollywood High School.  But the flow of the store and the quality of their wares is top drawer! 

Overall, very well organized. Good flow. Did I mention it smells good? Amazing selection of purses. No, I'm not looking to buy a purse. I'm a he man after all. I just thought some were so cute I wanted to squeeze them. Um. Anyway. The mens section is not bad, lots of XL and not so much small  though...wondering who sold them these clothes? Big, brawny bowlers? Not sure.

And for you nun collectors, you can't miss out on an entire area of nun bric a brac! Very fun! Like book stores, card shops and Hello Kitty Conventions, I could spend hours in here!

But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. 

Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. 

This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

I've been to this Szechuan restaurant on numerous occasions. Their chef is from Szechuan, and their extensive menu encompasses both authentic and Americanized dishes.  The sizable square-shaped interior includes good lighting, booths, lazy Susans, and traditional Chinese artifacts. 

The flavors of their Szechuan specialties are far more compelling than the Americanized items. These dishes often include meat, innards, or fish served in red chili pepper and a pool of tongue-numbing hot oil. The propensities of these dishes can be so intense that I often counteract with an order of light tasting vegetable or non-spicy items to lift the taste buds.

For appetizer, I recommend the Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). The strips of shaved tendon came with firm textures seasoned by hot oil. The same tongue numbing effect can be felt with an order of Fuqi Feipian ($6.95), another chilled dish prepared with beef shank, heart, and tripe. 

For main entrees, my favorite is the Mao Xue Wang ($15.95), a dish stacked with red chili, hot oil, pork blood, intestines, luncheon meat, tripe, and bean sprouts. The Water Boil Fish ($10.95) can be a good choice too due to the thick cuts of fish filets and light tasting ingredients that work in contrast to the heavier spicy oil. Their Ma Po Tofu ($7.95) was fresh, spicy, and addictive too.

Dishes that I like to order to accompany the numbing flavors are the Spicy Cabbage stir-fry ($6.95) and Tea Smoked Duck ($12.95). The sweetness of the cabbage tends to outweigh the peppers in it. The duck's tea smoked flavors had the same effect, but the meat can also appear leaner and boney than expected. I was disappointed in the Xiao Long Bao ($???) due to its thicker skins and ground pork that needed more seasoning. The much anticipated juicy effect was nonexistent. 

The dishes that I don't recommend are the Cumin Lamb ($13.95) and Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95). The composition of the lamb stir-fry with cumin, chili, and sesame was spot on, but the meat was cut too small for me to fully enjoy it. The Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95) also fell into this category for the thinly shaved kidney that tends to lose its ways and chewy texture.

I had mix results with the Americanized dishes. In particular, both the Walnut Shrimp ($12.95) and Orange Chicken ($8.95) failed to stand out. The flavor on the deep-fried chicken with orange slices and sweet and sour sauce fell flat. I'm not sure why they use sweet and sour sauce, and a hint of spiciness would have made it more dynamic. Additionally, the House Foo Young ($10.95) that came with eggs and a mix of seafood and meat was delicious, but the thick savory gravy made it too salty in the end.

Lastly, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95) was not made wit the right sauce. The Spicy Wonton ($5.95) was too skimpy and the rice plates such as Shrimp Fried Rice ($7.95) and House Fried Rice ($7.95) were pretty ordinary without the wok tossed airy texture.

Service can be wildly inconsistent depending on the individual server that I was assigned to. Overall, the Szechuan items were tasty and enough to bring me back for more. They also have a lunch special menu but prospective diners should consider their water boiled dishes, meat items, cold plates, and stir-fried vegetables in order to get a decent fare. 2.5 stars. I hope to visit their Chandler location to see if they are any better.

This place is great! The sushi is to die for! I really wish they would open one is Los Angeles. If you go try their Viva Las Vegas Roll and the Gojira Roll. They are out of this world good. The mushroom miso was a little weird because it was really not miso-ey (if that makes any sense). 

Also, if you go on a Sunday they have a DJ and their happy hour is amazing. I love happy hour and this is by far one of my favorites in Vegas. If you are staying at the Wynn it is directly across the street. So make sure you give it a try. I would definitely  recommend giving this place a try.

I honestly don't know which I enjoyed more...the beer or the popcorn!  I was skeptical to try a new brewery on Fremont Street, but glad I did.  The beer was very good and what a broad and interesting selection of beers as well.  The sampler had a good range of beers, but I had to try and wasn't disappointed in the Dry Country Belgium Quad!  It was full bodied and the 11% snuck up on me nicely!

Now the popcorn...not sure where they got it, who made it or what they sprinkle on it...but I'm pretty sure it's pure awesome!  I enjoyed the 4 which came with the sampler, but a few others in the group ordered additional flavors and all of them left me wanting more.

I will now make Banger Brewing on of my typical stops on my frequent Fremont Street outings!

I love Public House this was my second time here. The restaurant is located in the Venetian hotel. Let's keep this simple. 
Food we ordered all appetizer.
Poutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. 
Lamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.
Steak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).
Southern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.
And lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it. 
As for the drinks Huge selection of wonderful craft beers. 
The service was great and helpful. You'll see me around public house again.

This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.
After you are seated by the friendly hostess, you are given two menus. The shorter "American" menu lists dishes familiar to diners used to "Americanized Chinese" restaurants: beef and broccoli, lo mien, chow fun, and the like. The longer "Hong Kong Style" menu lists dishes characteristic of the more authentic Southeastern Chinese dining establishments.  For example, you'll find Hong Kong style roast pork and roast duck, veggies such as choy sum and sweet pea shoots, various kinds of seafood and tofu dishes, and even dishes that are daunting for the less adventurous American diner (example: fried intestines). 
My friend and fellow yelper John M. (lucky guy, he lives near this place) and I thoroughly enjoyed our orders here. The ingredients were really fresh, the shrimp and fish so succulent and tender, the sauces very flavorful without being overly seasoned, the deep-fried tofu still silky and tender within, the fried rice treated lightly so that it was not greasy. Great food at good prices - most of the entrees are in the $7.95 to $11.95 range.
Glad to have this establishment here, especially since I'm in the Melrose District often.

When Rickie mentioned going to the Thai Hut, I thought, that's funny, I'm really not in the market for neckwear. Then we drove by and it looked so cute. Like a Thai diner with lots of booths lining the windows which overlook McDowell around 3rd Ave. Obviously not a lot of money or design when into the reincarnation, but the energy of the room and the super friendly staff warmed me instantly. I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table, hot and crispy, before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water. Along with the chicken satay, they were both good, not out of this world however. Rickie's "chicken noodle" soup was flavorful, yet the chicken was hella funky. Oddly shaped bland, poached peices of poultry particularly unpleasant. The sizzling beef was Thairiffic. Really. Thairiffic. My obligatory phad thai, although missing the tofu, was very dee lish. Prices were affordable. No beer however and that made me sad. I mean I was just costume shopping at Easley's and really could have used a large Thai cerveza. Rickie loved his Thai iced tea (me? not a fan of that beverage...sort of tastes like lawn clippings and cream). The service is outstanding...attentive, friendly and efficient. That pushes them from 3 to 4 stars easily. Great energy, good food, smiling staff. I'll be back.

Man-oh-man, this place is da bomb! 

The So and I came in on a Wednesday night after slamming a few Long Islanders at the bar next door, so we were geared up for some serious grubbing. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Alberto. Wow, this guy had a golden personality and was working his station like a champ. He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty. 

We ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping. 
Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, "Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy". So I lifted the toasty-melty-saucy slice up to my face, hoisted it into my mouth, sank my fangs into it, and almost fainted with pleasure. I swear I could hear Lou Rawls singing in my ear as I worked my way down the slice to the crust. 

This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot. Dinner (Appetizer, Pizza, and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well, I'll just tell them the Devil made me do it.

"The Only Las Vegas Ultra-Dive Bar" might make you dive out the window into the Venetian lagoon below. First of all, f* you for calling anything an 'Ultra-dive' bar. You contain none of the features found in a good dive bar or an ultra lounge. You are a sports bar, Rockhouse. Own it (or take down your 80+ tv's playing sports). 

Unfortunately, they fail at the sports bar elements too. Drink prices at $8/shot and $12/cocktail? Huh. Why are you here? I can get a (better) $12 cocktail at a reputable joint somewhere else in the Venetian. Isn't this a $5 pint of Jack 'n coke type of place? WTF? The food was a fail for me as well. The grilled chicken and avocado sliders should be renamed "wood chip served between a sawdust bun" as they were dry, tiny and tasteless. Sure, you can come here with good company (as I did) and have fun, but that can be done anywhere in the area. 

Oh yea, they have a mechanical bull. Ride it. NEXT!

Phoenix royalty is in the 'slope! These guys, without question, are los reyes. They are not screwing around by making such a claim. 

People love the huaraches, which are gigantic corm tortillas covered with white cheese, red or green salsa, and mushrooms (hongos) or various meaty choices. I've had the huarache with mushrooms and the version with carne asada. I've also had the mouth-watering shrimp burrito. All are delicious, but...

The tortas are where it's at. I mean, they strike some kind of poetic balance that resists duplication. The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings, and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll. I'm partial to the milanesa (breaded chicken or beef). There's something about the mild crunch of the filling that combines with the smoothness of the avocado and the kick of the jalapeno. Fantastic.

Los reyes also deliver on the beverage front. The make their own fresh juice, so there are quite a few options for aguas frescas, licuados, etc. One thing worth trying is the vampiro: orange, carrot, celery, beet, and pineapple juices. The vampiro will probably cure the most intractable ailment.

The restaurant is also bustling and fun. Servers are friendly and multi-lingual. If you live in Sunnyslope, check the place out immediately. If not, it's worth a trip!

Guy-ism: We'd be hitting up the Linq like some Kulinary Gangstas and we had to stop in to try my brah Fieri's new place. 

English Translation: The Linq was flooded, half the stores shut down, so under coercion of my non-foodie bf, who for some reason has a man-crush on Guy, we tried Fieri's new place.

Translation: For $18 you get ammonium-smelling TILAPIA. Yeah, ok Guy... for $18, at least serve some seared ahi. The radish or ginger on top is gross. The tacos tastes plain, maybe they forgot the mojo de ajo??? 

Guy-ism: This place is money. Yeah, like it's going to cost you a lot of money! Dude, I know we be all gangster and thug and sh*t but 70 dead presidents for lunch is not cool. 

Translation: Fish Tacos, overly greasy Philly Dip Sandwich, one cocktail is the same price as a NY Steak dinner off-Strip. Yeah... screw you Guy and your man-crushes.

I was very excited to be chosen for this event, and not just because I got a sneak preview of J-WoW's sweater.  It was also to be the first time the lunch bunch would meet our cyber friend, Kazi, in person.

The venue was fantastic, located between 2 parking garages, next to an outdoor ice rink.  Upon arriving at the registration table, I spied the Santa photo op, so I grabbed Kazi for her first ever Yelp Elite photo (show some love and friend our newest Elite)

While at the bar, I indulged in a cherry vanilla porter, and I liked it.  The trio of ample hummus bowls were a delight, and I'm not ashamed to admit returning for seconds.

The hot chocolate was the finest I've ever tasted, especially after adding peppermint syrup and a heaping mound of whipped cream. 

While the food and beverage was delightful, the conversation was the high point, and I was lucky enough to spend a few minutes with the beautiful and engaging Kazi.  I loved seeing my friends... and meeting new Yelpers face to face is the icing on the cookie! (which there were a lot of)

I witnessed my first ever ugly Christmas poncho when J-WoW's +1, Linh, made his grand entrance.  Santa Sat on my lap, and my cheek was kissed by a pretty little lady who disappeared into the crowd. 

All in all, a pretty good night

I pledge allegiance to the Sweet Republic and the deliciousness for which it stands, one location with so many flavors, with something amazing and incredible for all.

I cannot say enough good things about Sweet Republic. How sweet it is.
I don't think you can go wrong here. If corn flavored ice cream is one of the best things I ever tasted, how can one go wrong? Whatever Helen, one of the owners and the genius behind the incredible array of flavors, tells me to put in my mouth I will. 

From the traditional Vanilla Bean to the unconventional Corn flavor, there is definitely something for everyone. The ingredients are top of the line and it comes through in the flavors. All the ice cream is made on the spot.

The decor is cool, well-designed, comfortable, friendly and eco-friendly wherever possible. The service is great, the staff is nice. So don't hesitate, the ice cream here is not only full of wonderful flavor, but it is a wonderful experience as well.

SOME People with strollers annoy me!  Sorry.  Ok, that's out the way.   

This festival could be more fun if #1 the vendors didn't run out of candy and #2 the lines weren't so long at the vendors/ballons  that had candy.  #3 there were more events/games than bouncy houses!  It is Halloween... Fall... a Festival.... how about games of some sort of skill (potato sack racing, obstacle courses, etc!!!), things you would expect at a Fall Harvest Festival.

We got there at about 5:10, so we did not experience all of the parking issues that others did.  But I can imagine that it was awful considering we waited in line and there were about 15 cars in the area at the time when we were parking.  

The KICKER?  1 Adult and 2 kids... $50 spent without any food, w/o any real drinks!  

Radio disney was a bright spot.  Wow, the energy of the staff was awesome.  I didn't know that the radio Disney had a local staion on the AM band.  I listen to satellite radio,  but that is good info to know.  

Tethered hot air balloon rides were nice.  

I'm over this event. Sorry, I tried to like it, but just could not get past the fact that it is advertised as a place to trick or treat BUT the treats were in short supply.  I wouldn't go back to this again.

I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars "A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks.

Cute! 

If you love funky, exotic, expensive chocolate, this place is a good place to check out. They have these fun, funky chocolate bars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=AgIkITFbopwNhh8aTyzBVQ you can find also at Whole Foods and some candy shops: Bacon Chocolate being their most famous i think. I've had it before and it's pretty good salty sweet. 
If i didn't have so many sweet places to hit, i would have liked to have had more time (and MONEY) to try their different truffles. A cool stop at the Forum Shops for a unique chocolate fix.

I've been to Share probably 2-3 times in the past couple of years and it's pretty much the same thing every time. I think if you haven't been to Share, it's definitely worth going at least once so you can take it all in, so to speak. It's one of the only nice gay clubs in Vegas and although you might be tempted to opt for Marquee or Tryst, sometimes, you just wanna gay it up. It's by no means anything fancy, but it isn't trashy either. Located just a short taxi ride away from the Strip (I think I paid around $12 from the Wynn), it's a good option if you want to let loose and be fabulous. Again as other Yelpers said, it's best to go with a group so you can have a good time.

- Expect it to be kind of empty.
- Expect some good dancy upbeat pop/hiphop music.
- Expect the drinks to be around $10 (not bad for Vegas IMO)
- Expect some hottie gay-for-pay dancers that will probably spend more time hitting on your hag than trying to get your attention.
- Expect to awkwardly avoid sexual advances from the Vegas locals (they are aggressive and can bite, unless you like that)
- Expect to be standing the entire time (because the empty seats are reserved for bottle service, which NO ONE is paying for)
- Expect to leave happy you experienced it, but somewhat disappointed.

That's all folks!

On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

This hotel/casino is a great example of good investments over time.  For decades Caesar's has been a top tier property in Las Vegas.  Here's why:

- It has consistently changed with the times but never strayed from it's target of being a top notch hotel.

- The Forum Shops is one of the best shopping malls in the world.  It has a collection of shops that are unrivaled in such a small space.

- The number of food options allows for any diet or preference.

- They've remodeled many of the old rooms and have built a new tower.  They've been able to stay relevant by doing so.

- They have some great nightlife options.  Pure is their anchor nightclub.

- The location in the center of the Strip allows you to wander around Vegas and experience both the old and new side of Vegas.

This is a must see property for our out of town guests.  They've never left disappointed.  I enjoy coming down and shopping at the Forum Shops, which I do 5-6 times a year.

Will I return?  There's no doubt about it!

I hesitate to bust out 5 stars after one appointment but when you've been through what I have with multiple doctors and you find one that listens, respects your...errr...'inquisitive nature', is willing to work WITH you and isn't an ego driven maniac you kind of want to shout it from the roof tops. So, YAY Dr. Andrea O'Conner!! 5 stars!

A little back story..
I've unknowingly struggled with Thyroid Disease for at least 4 years, maybe longer. Being confronted with a barrage of wacky symptoms like exhaustion, muscle weakness, depression, hardcore mood swings, edema, digestive issues, abdominal bloat, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, weight gain, severe joint pain, brain fog to the point of being mid sentence and forgetting words, freezing cold all the time and oh yeah....pulling CLUMPS of hair out of my head every day in the shower and having Marilyn Manson eyebrows (read: completely gone) is scary to say the least. It's also frightening how long one will endure things like this all the while attributing everything to 'getting older'. By the way, I'm 36 not 86. Never underestimate the power of denial!

It took some crazy blood sugar issues and kidney disease markers to drive me to an endocrinologist. I was diagnosed hypothyroid (thrilled at this revelation because I was thoroughly convinced I had cancer or was dying) given a nominal dose of dessicated thyroid hormone and told I would feel 'a lot better very very soon'. 
Let's just say that statement was laughable. 

Fast forward 8 months, 3 doctors, a shitload of research and self treatment on my part (out of desperation, not recommended of course) and I have found Naturopath, Dr. Andrea O'Conner. A weight has been lifted! Not once during my appointment with her was she condescending or did I feel like I was not being taken seriously. Her personality and the way she presents herself is also very genuine and without airs which I appreciate. I was honest about my previous experiences and what I expected and we have outlined a nice course of treatment that we are both comfortable with. 

If you have hormonal issues don't waste your time with an MD or Endocrinologist. Office appointments are not covered by insurance but lab work is and it's worth the out of pocket expense to regain control of your health. Phoenix Integrative Medicine offers all of those lovely aesthetic treatments like botox and dermal fillers, HCG etc. While I don't use those services, I would be comfortable referring someone to them with the experience I had.

Be your own advocate.

I want to hate you, Pane Bianco. I really really want to hate you. With every fabulous fiber in my being.

You have weird hours, an overwhelming "not quite industrial, not quite rustic" decor, and your $8 Mozzarella, Tomato and Basil salad consists of a cut up tomato and a few, uh, "slugs" of mozzarella topped with soggy basil leaves. 

But the real reason I want to hate you is that you duped me. You bamboozled, shanghaied and probably even Kansas City Shuffled me too.

You lured me into this false sense of disappointment with my tiny salad and loaf of bread rolled up in a piece of paper.

You watched me eat it too, didn't you?

You saw me take a big chunk out of one of those cheese slugs. You watched me enjoying that salad. That delicious, gooey salad.

And you liked it, didn't you? You liked watching me scarf down that salad like it was an item from a value menu. You got a sick kick out of seeing me tear through that bread like I'd never had it so good. 

You bastard.

I want to hate you. I want to give you two stars and rant and rave about how you teh lame.

But I can't. I just can't. 

That salad was just, like, whoa. That had to be the freshest mozzarella and the freshest tomatoes I'd ever tasted.

It made olive garden salad taste like bagged lettuce doused in olive oil.

And if Subway made bread as fresh as yours, I would stop going in there periodically to order the seafood sensation (toasted!) just to watch the employees and other patrons moan and cringe. 

I want to hate you. But that bait and switch, luring me in with that "too cool for you" vibe and then hitting me up with some flava, that takes skill. That takes cunning.

And as a woman who spent her youth tying bedsheets around her neck and trying to burn the neighbor's house down with her mind, I appreciate cunning.

Four stars for being cunning, and one star for being leaps and bounds of awesome ahead of Lux. 

I don't care if it's vegan. It's still a cupcake, you're still a grown up, and eating it while surfing the web on your flashy new laptop does not make you look any less ridiculous.

I came by here last week for a one o'clock lunch and was impressed by the quality and taste of their pizza. 

We've been to Crusts a bunch of times and have never made it over to their new quick individual pizza place near the PV Mall. It's actually few doors down from where the old Atomic Comics use to be.

I find MyPie is very similar in setup to Fired Pie on Northsight. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fired-pie-scottsdale#hrid:aWt21x1Kt7IlKg41opmbug  But the taste is better at MyPie in most instances and they excel -- way over the top at customer service. Crazy nice!

I went with the Margherita ($7.49) pizza (photos) with some sweet italian sausage ($1.00).  It was very good, so I ordered a regular one without sausage for home.  That pie wasn't as special as this, but overall slightly better than the one at Fired Pie.

Recently, the WSJ had an article on how Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has quietly joined a growing group of restaurants aiming to change how we eat pizza. http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304403804579264220659257040?ref=/news-lifestyle-arts-entertainment  

My friends in SoCal tell me these are very similar to Pieology: "Pieology prides itself on providing the best tasting, healthiest kustom pizza in the world. Using only the freshest ingredients, Pieology provides smoking hot pizzas in under 5 minutes."  

Whereas, Fired Pie says: "Fired Pie, a fast, casual, rich in flavor customizable pizza and salad made from scratch using fresh ingredients just the way you like it - all at a respectful price."

No matter!  I like My Pie slightly better than Fired Pie, but both are very good.  Expect to pay $10 to $12 for a very tasty individual wood fired pizza.  So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Enjoy!

Ok, for me if there's one thing that comes close to Buffet, it's a fried chicken place!  Thus, I wasn't about to miss the opportunity to get together with Robyn N. & Arlin B. today & have lunch today at this busy little place.  It was my first visit, & here's how it struck me:

*  Funky, unique, fun atmosphere & vibe about the place.  It's a screwy building to start with, then your water or beverage shows up in a quart canning jar, & so on!  FUN IS GOOD!!

*  Our service was prompt & attentive, & the staff members made it clear that they were glad we came here to eat!  These really nice people helped make the experience special.  FRIENDLY IS GOOD!!

*  Somewhat unusual (for me anyway), very tasty food overall.  DIFFERENT IS GOOD!!

*  Then, OMG, the chicken!!  TERRIFIC FRIED CHICKEN IS GOOD!!     :-))

Dexter ALWAYS gets spoiled here!  After Washington Park, where he was coated in every doggie fluid imaginable, he needed a bath.  Badly.  I didn't want him bringin' no doggie herpes home!
They remembered his name as soon as we walked in.  He's quite the popular puppy here.  I used to live across the street and he just looooves the place!
After a quick tutorial in the wash area, my 7-pound rat terrier was ready to be scrubbed.  They give you a few different brushes as well as shampoo AND conditioner!  I never thought to condition my pet's coat before. 
He also needed his lil nails clipped.  I was whisked right in, even though the groomer was doin' a pomeranian.  It was quick and pain-free.
Then, the treats.  Dexter loves the training treats!  We practice his tricks from school (PetSmart puppy class) every night and he devours the different treats.
His favorite?  Peanut butter!  They had some star-shaped peanut butter treats and even a mini peanut butter pie, which he got a slice of.
toys?  Tons!  Dexter needs squeakers.  Got him some long-ass, strange-looking pink dog that squeaks near its tail.  Bought it on Sunday and the dang thing already got decapitated.  There is white fluff all over my living room.  
It's all good, though.  You can't have a 7-pound dog be a total wuss, you know?

A burger in Vegas?  Not what you'd expect to dine on with sooooo many buffets and prime rib specials available within a 1 square mile radius.  The Burger Bar is conveniently located in the shopping wing, Mandalay Place at Mandalay Bay.  It's not really so much a bar...it reminds me more of like an upscale ice cream parlor.  The place is pretty spacious with counter seating and wood booths with granite tables. They offer a wide range of beers, both domestic and imported specialties, along with their version of the 'six dollar' burger.  The burgers are gourmet style, courtesy of Hubert Keller and are actually worth their inflated price.  They use some real top grade beef...Ridgefield Farms corn fed beef to Black Angus beef to American Kobe beef...they have something to satisfy the most discerning beef lover.  Not fond of beef, try their lamb, buffalo, chicken, or turkey burger.  For something more healthy, they also have salmon steaks and a veggie burger.  I tried the Ridgefield Farms American Classic burger, which came with bacon, lettuce, and a tomato slice.  The surprise on the menu, next to the $60 Rossini burger (Kobe beef laced with foie gras and truffles), are the many condiments that one can add to your burger...over 40 different choices.  I opted for the jalepenos and peppered jack cheese.  And here, when you ask for medium rare, it comes medium rare...it came out perfect.  Also a surprise, the service...excellent and attentive.  Worth the splurge...go have one!

So I got asked if I wanted to see the O show or the Fantasy Show. I could tell from their faces that they wanted to see topless girls so I agreed to go to the Fantasy Show because I'm not a prude. 

You know what? I really did enjoy this show. It was tastefully done and not trashy as I thought it would be. These girls were so beautiful and so mesmerizing throughout their performance. I'm not a lesbian but this show has made me become bi-curious? Okay, not really but I have to admit they were sweet eye candy.

The host/singer has an amazing voice and she kept everyone entertained. She had some of the audience participate in singing, which was awesome because some of them sounded like a dying cow. Lol.

I didn't get to see Sean E. Cooper but they had Lisa Sundstedt (from Chelsea Lately and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno) take his place. She was so friggin' hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at her jokes. :)

Some of the guys in the audience act like they've never seen naked chicks in their lives. When they see topless girls...they start going crazy by hooting, hollering, and making disgusting comments. Seriously, those perverts need to go to a strip club instead of coming to this show because they're ruining it for the people who sit next/close to them.

Anyways, you guys should definitely go to this show if you're not embarrassed or ashamed of seeing half naked girls. Ladies, you should be a good sport and bring your guys here for some entertainment. ;)

Some might say we aren't a very urbanized city, but I beg to differ. Take Food Truck Friday for example. Every Friday, the Phoenix Public Market parking lot is transformed into food truck fun! Misters cool the crowd, a radio station livens up the atmosphere with jams and several food trucks fill the parking lot ready to serve food to hungry Phoenix residents. I visited when Food Truck Friday first started last year and I went back again today. Both times have been a fun-filled foodie adventure! It also helps that Phoenix Food Truck favorites like Short Leash Dogs and Hey Joe set up shop for the day. Today, I only ate at Short Leash because my little cockapoo Harley was the featured dog of the week! After ordering my food, I made my way to one of the several shaded picnic tables and enjoyed the misters, music and a lively environment while I ate the Harley (a spicy dog topped with caramelized onion, chili and whiskey sauce!) This is a go-to lunch spot for anyone in the area from 11 AM - 1:30 PM on a Friday and once you visit, you will soon forget any thought of Phoenix not being urban enough!

Have you ever watched those dumb/boring/nerdy space documentaries that tell you lies regarding the impossibility of time travel? Some dude with a talking computer tells you "...currently, there is no way to deviate from the space-time continuum"... Lies! I'll tell you how to do it.  You don't even need to buy a time machine on eBay like Kip Dynamite. Just get into your car (no, it doesn't have to be a Delorian) and drive to 7th Ave and Thomas Rd (just south of Thomas on the E side), and BAM! You, my friend have entered another dimension.

You walk into this place and you expect to see Cowboy Biff sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, all you see is elderlies shuffling about. Well, they must know something that we all don't. Like an old man/woman secret that they only tell their peers. You, my friend, have just learned their secret! Sit down and order yourself a Black Bean Burger. What? You say you don't like vegetarian food? Well, neither do I! Trust me. Do it!

While you wait, you can imagine you are your grandpa at 12 years old. Just stopping into the local soda fountain shop to get a smooth refreshing malt. Being a 12 year old in the 1930s, you notice how modern and sleek the decor is in here. Ice cream adverts everywhere... Makes you want to stay 12 forever.

"Mom, can I have some ice cream?" Oh, I mean "Sorry, can I get a strawberry malt with that Black Bean Burger? Ahem, thanks..."

I came & tried to give this place a fair shot but it's really a dud!  Now you pay just a little less than Sweet Tomatoes used to cost, but you only get to go through the salad line once, & you don't even get to put your own dressing on!  Then, remember the selection of 6 soups (& up to 10 at one location in the Valley).  Well, now we're down to 3 soups!  On top of that you have to spend about the same amount again to get an entree unless you want to go somewhere else to eat when you leave here!

In summation:  Poor dining plan, a way high price, & while we're about it, lousy architecture in the newer Field Kitchen locations that are opening in the Valley, of the six.  They're like 3-story high metal barns inside...  or are they airplane hangars?  

What are these people on??     :-O

Dreamy scenery, with the warmth of the huge glassed-in fireplace contrasting nicely with the crystal chandeliers. 

Excellent service, with our server explaining the menu to us in depth. 

Good food. Not excellent, but good. 

My one problem that I couldnt overlook and which really spoiled the whole experience for me was this:

Our waiter duped us into buying an entree. 

Allow me to explain. 

We told the waiter we wanted to split a meal. We werent that hungry and why pay for an extra plate if not necessary? We TOLD him this, and we were willing to pay a sharing fee or whatever. 

So after he told us the specials, the last of which was a surf and turf that added on scallops for $15 or so, we gave him our steak order. The waiter says "would you like to add on an order of scallops? Theyll complement the steak very well." I say "ok" assuming it would be an add-on. 

Nope. 

I got five (albiet very large) scallops. On a separate plate. We shared everything. And when tge bill came, those scallops werent $16, or $20, but THIRTY-EIGHT DOLLARS. 

So what probably would have been four and a half stars turned into two. Left a VERY bad taste in my mouth. 

I doubt we'll be back.

The last time I was there my burger and fries were gnarly bad. The fries were not cooked and tasted like oil and the burger had me thinking what was I thinking by coming here for lunch. Well at least I got a free soda by checking in on Yelp.

Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down "Greek" takeout in Hawaii. 

With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.  

Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.

Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.

Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.  

Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.

Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.

Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after "hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?"  Heck yeah!

Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me.

There are enough places to blow your money in Vegas - go to Earl of Sandwich for one of your meals and get the best bargain in town for seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had anywhere!

I made sure to rush to write my review after a recent trip to Vegas because I can't rave enough about their holiday special sandwich, which is pretty much the best Thanksgiving sandwich you'll ever have anywhere (and that includes the Bobbie at Capriotti's, which is another one of my faves). The only thing is that they only offer this til January, so make sure to run over and snatch one up!

Though the ingredients are what you would expect (turkey, gravy, stuffing, cranberry), i fell in love with the flavor and quality of each of them. I think the thing that makes it is the bread, which is somehow perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. 

Believe the hype! Unlike a lot of other places in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a sure win!

An all American steakhouse.  No Australian Wagyu.  No A5 Japanese beef.  Just USDA Prime Nebraska corn feed beef and American comfort food sides that bring out the best in the beef's flavor.

Rule one:  Stick to land.  Visit it's sister restaurant, Lakeside for well prepared seafood.  This is a steakhouse.

For starters, classic foie.  Served incredible thick cut, beautifully seared with slivers of apple, apple puree, tart huckleberries and vegetal celery leaves.  Beautiful balance. Pure decadence.  The charred steak tartare with the classic Worcestershire, Dijon, chives and crumbled egg is equally good.  The slight addition of the heat tightens up some of the beef and releases it's beef flavor.  Good texture and another flavor dimension.

To the steaks.  USDA prime, well aged, extremely well trimmed.  All steaks cooked to temperature, juicy and tender.  Top props to the 28 day, dry aged tomahawk.  Complex, nutty, slightly bleu cheese flavor of the dry aging and deep beefy goodness near the bone.  Win!   The porterhouse for two, the best way to enjoy both the filet mignon and the NY strip.  Less complex flavor but a steak lover's steak.  Once again, excellent beef flavor nearest the bone.

A well made variety of sauces are offered that enrich or brighten the steaks but then again, why rob yourself of the great American beef flavor?

Sides are very well conceived.  They enhancing the smoky, umame characteristics of the beef.  Top props to a great late season creamed corn topped with shaved black truffle.  Sets off all kinds of earthy fireworks when paired with the beef.  Sauted wild mushrooms (enhance umame) and grilled jumbo asparagus with the hint of vibrant lemon juice (contrasting flavor enhancing the beefs natural sweetness) all great choices.

Service is steakhouse familiar and efficient.

Excellent wine list. Good vintage depth.  New world emphasis.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Consistent.  Several repeat visits (thanks to the Wynn Classic tourney).  An American steakhouse that hits the mark.

I hate saying this about any venue that opens in CenPho but this experience was just HORRIBLE!

Now granted this was the first day of their soft open but the food prepared by the self professed "Celebrity Chef" was not good ... not even a little.

We had two tapas ... the first was the potatoes where were mini and most of them were undercooked and hard. They were not good.

We also had Lobster Cakes were were had an extremely intense taste (that I didn't like) and that taste completely drowned out the Lobster. One of the cakes was even cold in the middle.

I also had a steak that was under cooked and in no way a great piece of meat (chewy and a strong line of tough fat running through the entire piece).


The place is EXTREMELY small and because of that the tables are WAY to close together ... and nearly impossible to navigate without bumping into the people next to you.

I'm just sooooo sad that this place was a fail for us.

Came in here for a 3 night stay since my client used my product on this remodel of what use to be the Sahara casino and hotel. I enjoyed the convenience of either valet parking at two different valet stations or self parking which had easy access to the rooms unlike the competition on the strip.  Checking in was effortless possibly BC it was a Monday afternoon.

My room was located on the 19 floor, modern & Chic and the usage of border lit mirrors opened the room up. The bed was comfy and the bathroom contained  a shower that was glass enclosed with a high pressure rain forrest shower head. The room also had a safe for valuables and a fully stocked bar & snacks.

I was able to experience dinning at two of the many eateries -once at the Unami Sports Bar & Beer Garden and several times for bfast at the Griddle Cafe. All of the three times were solid and convenient.  The hotel spa contains an adequate fitness center and is open 24 hours to work off all those excess calories you're bound to indulge in. The casino is on the smaller side, but I actually found it enjoyable since it is quaint and less congested. 

I was here to visit clients and usually avoid staying away from the strip but my stay at the SLS proved just the opposite and I would definitely return again in the future.

My little brother and I decided we were hungry, so I quickly yelped what was near me, and Fat Boy was one of the first to show on my nearby list.  I quickly read a couple of reviews and found that all were 5-stars. My curiosity sky-rocketed, I looked up the menu online, and we called in to order. (They were going to close in 20 minutes, but were still undoubtedly happy to take & make my order. THUMBS UP!)

WHEN: They are open & available from 10am-9pm. Dine in, take-out, delivery!

WHAT WE HAD:
-Guacamole Boyger: This was my pic, and yayyy!! I did it!! This burger was satisfactory indeed!!! If you are a fan of avocado, this should be your pick!
-Hawaiian Boyger: This was my brother's choice and of course I had to snag a bite!! This burger was like CRACK! I seriously wish I chose this burger as my first pick! It had the perfect amount of pineapple, plus that bbq sauce! Gotta love that bbq sauce on a burger!
-Chencho fries: Now this is a must try!!! You can choose either fat or skinny fries! It is drenched in that delicious green sauce and covered in melted mozzarella! NUM NUM NUM

WHY: You will not be disappointed!!

*NOTE: I was chatting it up with the dude that worked there, and I was explaining what yelp was to him. He said he gets a lot of yelpers!! Muahaha, YELPERS SPREAD LOVE!

I remember VERY LITTLE of how, when, and where exactly the "Secret Pizza" place was, but I do remember the delicious aftermath.  After finding the "secret" hallway, we stormed in like gangbusters, asked the nice pizza man what was "good"  to which he rightfully suggested his own "meat lover's" version -- a seemingly off-the-menu creation concocted of pepperoni, sausage, peperoncinis, some other kind of meat, and some other stuff I'm failing to remember.  It was SO DAMN GOOD -- the not-so-soggy thin crust was absolutely what we needed, so much, that it got the stamp of approval from the two Manhattanites I was...ahem...dining with.  This WHOLE PIZZA easily fed 3 inebriated people or would feed about 37 models, 4 normal people or 15 people on a diet.  It should be noted that the two latter classes of people really don't belong in Vegas anyway.

There is minimal seating inside, but you can take your pizza "to-go" and park it on one of the Cosmo's luxurious couch seating areas in the hall right outside.  Beer and wine only.

I spent my morning at Echo Coffee doing some work and conducting some interviews... I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was when I walked in (even though Steve, the owner, gave me shit about how I ordered my coffee drink).  Thank goodness he warned me that a large americano at Echo comes with four (yes, four) shots of espresso.  I am good with two!  It turned out great and energized me for hours... and no sweetener necessary.

I noticed that in addition to the pastries in the case, there is an entire menu dedicated to sandwiches and salads and everything can be special ordered since there is a chef on premises.  I also met the biscotti maker when I was there.  How impressive that there is an entire team behind Echo, right?!

There is free Wi-Fi and outlets scattered around, plenty of seating, and clean restrooms to boot.  This may just become my new "go-to" coffee shop!  See you soon, Echo!

The 9th Island:  Portuguese sausage, spam, jalapeos, pineapple and mozzarella pizza?  I'm so there!

Enter Buddha Belly Deli.  Aside from the odd tribute to Hawaii, essentially a mish mash of Asian flavors creating new Asian comfort food in Hendertucky.  And it's good.

In general, individual components to each dish are well made with the slightly over pronounced flavors.  Dishes lean towards South East Asia but with well controlled spice heat.  A series of house made chili sauces and concoctions can definitely make dishes thermonuclear without masking flavor if desired.

The pho dip lives up the hype.  A banh mi dipped in a flavorful beef pho broth.  Fresh baked roll loaded with five spice rubbed, rare, sliced beef and just the right amount of still crisp pickled been sprouts onions cilantro and basil slathered with hot, pungent Chinese mustard.  Simply put great eats.  The char siu pork roll equally good.  Juicy but not excessively fatty char siu topped with an Asian slaw and hoisin on a sweet bun.  Need I say more.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a side of their house made chips that provide a great textural contrast and neutrality between bites of the flavorful offerings.

A very good clam.  Basically tom yum kung with clams.  Aromatic, herbaceous, rich and warming.

The fries topped with Japanese curry (no coconut milk or aggressive spices of Indian curry) and a fried egg and strips of nori (laver), is and outstanding take on the Midwest classic.  Creamy, messy, and just plain good.

Finally, dragon breath fries.  Not spicy but a good wallop of garlic will remind you of its goodness for hours.

Although not destination worthy from the Strip, a great neighborhood, locals kind of fast food restaurant with a very friendly staff.

Another fun Yelp elite event!  As a wine lover, I couldn't pass this one up--and it didn't disappoint!  I sampled the Malbec (which I'd had before), the shiraz, and the merlot.  Although the Malbec was the most unique, I think I enjoyed the merlot the best, due to its depth and richness combined with its mellow drinkability.  Although I didn't decorate a wine glass (too busy hobnobbing with my fellow elites), those who did seemed to enjoy it--and hey, even I got a free wine glass!

For food, there were samples available from the Wheel and Wedge, the Great Harvest Bread Co., and Gaucho Parrilla Argentina.  Of these vendors, the only one I'd heard of was Gaucho (see my review), so it was great to learn about some exciting new local goods.  As expected, Gaucho delivered in the flavor dept. with a sample consisting of shrimp and rice, an another of marinated roasted pork, greens, onions, and crimini mushrooms (my favorite of the two).  The cheeses from Wheel and Wedge were specifically chosen to pair with certain wines, and even though I didn't realize that until after I'd eaten them, they were delectable nonetheless.  Finally, the breads from Great Harvest (onion-herb and cranberry-apricot, I think?) were fresh and flavorful, with my favorite being the latter.  I don't get over to Bakery Square often, but next time I do, I'll have to pay them a visit!

As usual, thanks to our wonderful CM Rachel C. for organizing.  And thanks to my fellow elites for the scintillating and enthralling conversation about food and life!  It was great to meet those of you who I haven't met before, and I hope to see you at another event soon!

The moment they opened Lush up at Chandler Fashion Center, I rejoiced.  No more trips out to Scottsdale or ordering online to get all my bubbly needs!  But with that comes a significantly lighter wallet.  Help me.

I love everything about this shop.  The sales people are always so stinkin' sweet and they let me play and touch everything.  Always quick with product selection and are walking product-know-it-alls, they recommend some of the best items ever without being pushy.  We all know what I mean:  those sales rep that scare you into buying their goods... it doesn't happen here!  It's a spacious shop with lots of goodies and it's always an exciting and divine-smelling trip.  Where else will a friendly face offer you a facial or hand massage while scrubbing some dead skin off you?

I love their bubble bars [Blue Skies & Fluffy White Clouds ultimate fave], their Dream Cream, the Popcorn Lip Scrub, Floating Island body melt, It Started with a Kiss lip stain, Honey I Washed The Kids soap, the limited edition Rose Jam shower gel, et cetera. There's just so much to love, so much to buy!  Don't forget to ask for some free samples when buying some goodies.

Before Bacchanal,  Before Wicked Spoon, Before the Buffet at the Bellagio, Before everyone else got on the bandwagon, This buffet started it all
Buffet Stations, each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. 

I can remember when this was the "It" or should I say the "Must Eat" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas, It's old, the ambiance is not as vibrant, the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more, but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. 

I've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum, BBQ pork, steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!

Pricing is in line with other buffer. 

Tip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. 

Everything was good. The only thing is, Las Vegas is into Great things, newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days, but it holds its own as far as I'm concern.

It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.

Yes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.

Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.

However, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.

As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.

While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Let me join the Marisa S. and Joe S. bandwagon and say this place is fantastice and yhanks yo Joe and Marisa, I now know about it!  I/we went here on a Wednesday night after the ISC UYE with a few yelpers for their wine tasting quiz.  For $10, you get a blind 4 wine tasting in which you compare your tasting notes to the list  the Wine Warehouse provides and then you make an "educated" guess for each of the wines you are tasting.  I loved it.  What a great idea.  And the best part, if you get all 4 correct, your flight is free.  Ahhhhh, bliss.  I got none correct.  Zero.  Bummer, but I drank wine! 

This is a very cute and well stocked wine store and from what I can tell, the staff is very knowledgeable and well trained.  From the serious jazz tunes playing to the short sale wall to the wonderful assortment of tapas and cheese plates, this wine store has all the makings of a fun evening out!  Can you imagine telling your date or friends, lets go to a wine store tonight.  They would be surprised!

My return factor is 100%

Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  

I came back twice just because I liked it so much.

I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!

The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.

Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

My, OH-My!

This was my first visit to Posh and I can not wait to return. From the ambiance, service and cuisine this was a stellar experience.

Nestled in a condominium complex, this wonderful 26 seat food bar gives front row viewing to the complex culinary skills of the kitchen staff. With additional table seating if that's your preference.

We were greeted warmly and seated at the food bar. After completing the questionnaire regarding allergies and preferences, we ordered the five course plus the foie gras supplement and included the wine pairing. Each serving was presented to the two of us precisely at the same time then described in detail. 

The dining experience started with an amuse bush of persimmon salad. Then I was served a lovely salad that combined blood orange, avocado, chocolate, hazelnut and watercress into an amazing combination of flavors. Next was the perfectly cooked scallop with mustard, chanterelles, shallots and thyme. The third course was the foie gras that was a visually stunning presentation as well as being delectable. This was followed by confit of wild boar bacon, duck crackling with maple glaze on a butternut puree. A selection of cheeses was served as the fifth course that mingled creamy and savory flavors.  A clever twist of a snicker bar made of a chocolate pate with cognac caramel sauce was the finale.

This was an extraordinary experience and I look forward to returning. Thanks to chef Josh Hebert and the entire staff at Posh!

I was about to start a new weight lost challenge, but knew before that was to start I wanted something sweet and good!  I was in the area for lunch and saw that there was this sweet looking bakery at the end of the shopping center, so I knew that's where I was headed to!

I ordered the Salted Carmel Mocha cupcake to go, just from looking at it I was already drooling! You could clearly see the salt crystals on the top of the drizzled caramel!  Its my new craving, salty/sweet! Can't get enough it!

Got back to work and got to try it out! Let me tell you! The cake part of the cupcake was amazing! It was a moist chocolate with chocolate chucks inside! Yes!! Chucks!!! Yummy!!! The frosting, omg, you get a nice blend of mocha, caramel and salt!! OMG HEAVEN!!!!  This was a perfect cupcake for me!

Also for you ice cream lovin fools (I'm more of cake brownie person) they serve thrifty ice cream, I remember back in the day, that was the bomb ice cream!!  And if you have a crazy sweet tooth, they also have for sale shoots of frosting!!! Forget the cake and go straight to the sweet stuff!!!

Best buffet in my entire life. The buffet is top tier. I give this a marvelous 5 stars rating from my personal experience. No bias and no gimmicks. 

There are lot of places you would have to wait about an hour or so, but WIcked Spoon is far the only place I could wait all day, because it is so simply worth dining here. Modern atmosphere to blend with the Cosmo hotel's ambiance. 

Process: 
-You wait in line, pay at the cashier then get seated. Price is about $35~, add $9 for unlimited champangne/mimosa/bloody mary.  Love the champange! I made myself drunk here to get my money's worth, haha. 

-Serve yourself with the best Las Vegas food on the strip.
-They basically have everything, from Italian to Korean to Chinese to Mexican to American food. 
-The salad bar is amazing. Love the shrimp shooters. 
-Gelato........ so bomb. 'Nuff said! 

A lot of options here and it's pretty much no limits. My friend is a vegetarian and there are a lot of vegetarian options! 

Yup, we both stayed here for 3 hours.

Rock of Ages is like watching fireworks made of diamonds, jizz and Aqua Net explode in the night sky, while a choir of leather-clad angels pour sunshine joygasms into your ears, and the naked Thunderbirds fly by overhead, trailing clouds of cocaine and pure cane sugar. IT'S THAT GOOD!

Every single thing about it is fantastic and well-executed. The costumes are hilarious, the staging is fantastic, the music will rock your sox off (even if you don't like 80s metal, you'll recognize almost every song), the band is amazing, the theater is cleverly decorated with vintage signage (hello, Budweiser ladies!) and the cast goes BALLS-OUT the entire way.

Even the book is fan-fuckin-tastic -- usually with these "jukebox musicals," the plot is paper-thin and basically just an excuse to string together a bunch of old songs. But Rock of Ages actually manages to make SENSE, and even to be genuinely witty along the way. And this is coming from someone who despises Broadway musicals and Vegas shows in general.

Kudos to the writers, set designers and costumers...but the real accolades go to the cast, which is astonishingly fantastic (and trust me, I DETEST showbiz people). In particular, special shout-outs must go to narrator/comic relief character Lonny (the indescribably fabulous and hilarious Mark Shunock); evil German developer Hertz (the fabulous Robert Torti); his son Franz (wacky Kevin Hegmann); and club owner Dennis (a sort of Jeff-Bridges-as-the-dude-y Troy Burgess).  

But top kudos must go to the beautiful monstrous freak who plays badass rocker Stacee Jacks. I know they say Tom Cruise did a great job playing this character in the movie (which I haven't seen)...but I honestly can't imagine ANYONE doing this better than Kyle Lowder, who sort of looks like a Barbie doll on steroids and is just side-splittingly/mouth-gapingly/unbelievably AMAZING in this role. 

I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed this fantastic, bombastic spectacle! Such a relief to see a show that doesn't take itself too seriously -- this shit is tongue-in-cheek, all the way. It WALLOWS in gratuitous cheese. RUN, don't walk -- and check this show out before they replace it with some more Cirque du Bullshit!!!

The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.

I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.  

It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. 

My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  "This can't be a good sign", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  

My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.

The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  

The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. 

We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.

The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.

Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.

The Signature at the MGM is another great place to stay. The hotel is a smoke free hotel and that was a huge plus for us. The staff were all wonderful and friendly. Another good thing was that it was connected to the MGM so you walk through the towers.
Our room UPH( upper penthouse) was on the 38th floor with a beautiful view .The room was very nice and up to date. It has a wonderful king size bed with a pull out couch bed. The bathroom had a jacuzzi, shower, and  his and her's sink and small flat screen tv. The room also has a small kitchen area. 
The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star was that the housekeeping was lacking. We had to call 3 times for towels. 
Another than that The Signature is great place, and I would stay with them again in the future since Vegas is our second home.

Over the last few months, Fresh and Easy has been morphing into a Convenience Store. It's less a traditional grocer now. 

F & E business model was setup for the professional or working couples, who were on the go and just wanted to stop by to grab something quick. 

Well, now they've taken that concept to the next level and removed several aisles (primarily soda) to make room for coffee and drink kiosk, along with chairs and tables.  

I'm not sure how that is working out for them, since there is a AM/PM right next door doing a brisk business. When I was here recently it was empty. The Fry's up on Shea and 90th has a wine bar and they're always packed. Go figure.

I use to come down to Coolidge quite a bit and one of the cool things I use to do was come over here and visit the ruins.  A great piece of Arizona history!  Do you remember the Five C's?  Well, this is cotton country.

The Park Rangers will tell you they don't really know how old the ruins are, but most guess at around 600 years plus.  But thanks to a forward thinking US Government, the ruins are now protected by a 70 foot high shelter.  Trust me, it comes in handy in July and August, the two months I seem to visit here most.  LOL.  I would also recommend a visit to the bookstore.  It stocks a variety of First Nation history, as well as info on the area.

While you are in Coolidge, I would recommend the Gallopin' Goose for drinks or bar food, and Tag's for dinner.  Both are great!

"Eat rice, drink tea, slurp noodles, stay healthy".  Maybe.

Accept this about all Asian restaurants on the Strip:
1)  Prices are 2x-3x higher than your local joint.
2)  Portions are smaller but prettier.
3)  Flavors are not authentic.
4)  Specialty drinks are delicious.
5)  Service is excellent.

Straight to it, the food.  It's properly cooked by Western standards.  Veg in stir fries are still crisp and vibrant, deep fried chicken still moist, and scallops tender not rubber balls.  Seasonings and flavors are loosely Asian but are subdued and for the uninitiated.  Don't expect undertones of sweet, fermented fish sauce or umame charged fermented black beans.  The subdued flavors do work better with their creative mixed drinks.

Skip the everyday items or risk leaving upset at the price (miso soup at $9, beef broccoli at $25).  Opt for the extravagant.  The lobster tail in ginger onion soy glaze is good.  Correctly cooked.  The simple earthy soy does enhance the sweetness of the lobster and the ginger adds zest.  The togarashi rubbed seared ahi with a miso lime sauce is very good.

The only serious fault remains the sushi.  Questionable freshness.  The Uni, off color and fishy.  The sweet shrimp, slightly ammoniated and tacky mouth feel.  Creative rolls still miss the mark.  Over sauced, unbalanced flavors, bizarre cooking techniques.  Is the chef so vain he can't try one of the many AYCE joints and see how Vegas style sushi is done?  Face it, asking a Chinese chef to prepare Japanese sushi is the same as asking a Italian pizza cook to make dim sum.

To the credit of management, service problems have been correct.  Everyone is familiar with the menu and can describe dishes.  Bar staff who float ask regular staff before making recommendations.

Standard Asian beers.  Fairly priced introductory sakes.  

Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked "Asian" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.

Okay, I've been holding back on this one.

For three years I have been coming here dropping off my collared work shirts. Over that time, the wheels have started falling off this place  In my original review, I mentioned how management tries hard and when they goof, they try and fix it.  Let me give you two examples.

After writing my original review, four of my shirts started developing tiny holes on the back collar.  Pin size, all in the same place, right rear.  After a few cleanings, the holes became pencil size.  Well, I complained and was given a nearly two hundred dollar credit for the damage. They didn't replace the shirts. But I felt at the time an effort had been made to reach out and make amends.  Hence, my original Three Stars (now lowered to One).

A year later, after I replaced the shirts, my new ones started developing stress tears on the breast pockets. I thought, what the...#$&%!  So I pointed it out and they said I must be doing something to the pockets to cause the rip. 

They offered me a $85 credit toward future cleaning after damaging five shirts!!  I took the credit and decided to move on.  Not surprisingly, many of my co-worked have experienced similar problems. I feel for fellow Yelp friend Esther.  If they had damaged one of my suit...  well  Caveat emptor.

I say never again!

For my 800th review I chose my alma mater, UNLV.  It's been a while since I've graduated from this University.  However, I've had many interns from the school work for me and have hired many graduates over the years.  I also attend a lot of events at the school and remain very close with Alumni.  Here's my breakdown of the school:

PROS

- It's very cheap.  Even though tuition is going up, it's still less than many other State schools.

- Much of the campus has new buildings.  When I go on campus now, it feels like a strange place and I get lost all of the time because its 3x larger than it was when I attended.

- Great professors.  I can only speak about the College of Hotel Administration and the Business School.....the professors were awesome.  I learned so much from them.  Learning is a 2 way street, it's up to you to get as much out of it as you can.  It's not on the professors to make the class how you like it, you have to adjust to their teaching style and learn as much as possible.  To this day I remain in contact with many former professors.

- Nice campus.  By Vegas standards there's a lot of greenery around campus, which is a refreshing change of scenery.

- Library.  One of the best libraries in town is located on the UNLV campus.

- Basketball team.  The UNLV Runnin' Rebels have always been the favorite team in the city.  We've had some good years recently.  Hopefully we'll continue to build upon it and improve as time goes on.

CONS

- Minuscule Endowment Fund.  One of the main reasons UNLV is having a difficult time surviving in this economy is not only because of state cutbacks but also because the endowment is very tiny.  The school needs more support from the private sector.

- Visitor parking.  Student parking has improved dramatically since the time I was a student.....however, visitor parking is a nightmare.  I dread parking every time I go on campus.

Overall, I have fond memories of UNLV.  My experience here has helped me with my career and I've established many lifelong friendships over the years.  I would be proud to send my Son to this school.

1. Almost no lines
2. $11 dollars for a half yard
3. Awesome flavors 
4. Free samples for the indecisive
5. An extra shot for only a dollar

TIP#1: For The Flavor-Lovers
If you're the type who wants to get the drink to enjoy the flavor, get the Bellini (peach) or Eye Candy. They're super sweet and very reminiscent of jamba juice.

TIP#2: For the Alkies
If you want to get smashed or at least a little tipsy, get the High Octane or Hurricane with an extra shot to get the job done. Don't worry, it tastes a lot better the further down you get.

TIP#3: If You Get the Extra Shot...
...I advise that you lift it up a little and empty some out while mixing. If you don't, the alcohol (in my case it was 151) will all settle at the bottom and you won't want to go on any further. 

TIP#4: For the SUPER Alkies, Such as Myself
Try it when it's hot in the day, they're amazing in the 101 degree heat...until the alcohol makes you all warm. Then go inside.

HAPPY MARGARITA CONSUMING!

I got some promo tickets from a promoter in the Quad and went to this show on a whim.  I was not sure about spending $100 on Le Reve in Encore, so this is what we ended up doing.  Let me say this, what a super fun show!  I was laughing so damn hard.  I will say that Frank Marino is really engaging and hilarious.  Just a side note, he talks in rapid fire, stand-up style and throws a lot of show biz references and jokes that some generations/foreigners may not get.  So brush up on your current events and pop stars!  

There are a lot of drag performers performing as stars like: Beyonce, Madonna, Shania Twain, Mariah, Janet Jackson...Cher was prob my personal fav, but all the acts were great.  It is nice that you can sing along and that the audience is so carefree and chill.  There were people of all ages there and the place is so small that you really don't get a bad seat.  I recommend the middle though and not the left and right sides. My upgrade tickets were $20 and drinks were under $10, so this is totally affordable for a show on the strip.

The kinda naked male dancers did the majority of the dancing.  There was one guy who was 2-3 beats off from the rest, but after a while you got used to his dancing being off. lol.  Oh and the end gets you too.  It is all funny, but they show a serious side as well. Go Divas!  Great, great show!

REVIEW # 100 !!! 
Blue Man Group, at the Venetian Hotel in Vegas, was entertaining, educational and musical all the same time. I had the pleasure of attending Blue Man with my entire extended family and I have to say- I think this was the best situation to see the show.  

The show was interactive and even slightly captivating at times. Audience members are escorted to the stage to participate and the members of the show walk through the aisles, and sometimes even climb over the seats.  You can't get much more interactive than that.  

There are two shows, one at 7 pm and one immediately after it at 9pm.  I dont know how those guys do it, they have to clean the entire theatre after having just trashed it.  

I have to say- I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more paint involved.  It seemed more of a comedy/music show that I thought.  So much emphasis had been put on the pipes and paint, but very little time was actually dedicated to them.

Would I see it again?  You know, I think Blue Man Group is a treat to see once but seeing as the show hasn't changed at all since it opened, it will almost positively be the same if you went back again.

Last night, I had the realization that I am a true Scottsdale girl and I'm quite alright living in my Scottsdale nightlife bubble. 

Here are some differences I noted: 

Scottsdale: If you look good and are female, you get in for free and probably drink for free. 

Hurricane Bay: If you look good and are female, thug looking dudes will stand outside of your car making sex faces, causing you to make your male friend come and get you for fear of what happens if you open that door and walk out there alone. Then you pay $10 to get into a not so hoppin Halloween party. Guys hump your ass without asking and without buying you a drink first. 

Dress code for males in Scottsdale: Nice jeans, button down shirt, shaved or carefully groomed, and they usually smell like nice cologne. 

Hurricane Bay: wife beater and jeans that haven't been washed in weeks. Hair that says I just got out of jail and tats to match. Standard cologne called BO. 

Drinks are strong but their well vodka has to be a step above Gordon's. 

Also, I think there may be dealers right outside selling rohypnol. Needless to say it is a creeper's paradise. 

I'll stick with Blue, thank you!

About twelve of us came here for an iced tea business lunch. You know what I'm talking about. We also enjoyed a lively discussion about all things, including the food which we enjoyed. 

We had several appetizers, including the Chicken Satay, Calamari, Pot Stickers and Edamami and pitcher after pitcher of their delicious iced tea. LOL. 

All of us thought they did a nice job. The only question mark was with their Meat Loaf, or was it pot roast. But the Steaks, Filet Mignon, Fish, and Burgers were all very tasty and cooked to order. 

Expect to pay $35 each and thank you to that corporate card. LOL. We will be back.

[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]

Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?

Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was "Leave your inhibitions at the door", Bandaids follows up with "... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes."  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.

So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at "the talent".

Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.

I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a "whusssuuup" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly "Hi!" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.

This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.

But wait.

On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about "check out THIS fucking thing!", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like "Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?"  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, "Oh.  Its nice.  I like it." before shitting himself.

I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  

Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.

Stevey P:" Shopping for a jock strap in a former Albertson's seemed weird...:

I do not. Know. How. To top. That. 

Those who know me, however, do not see me as a top anyway, so I will move on...

We walked into this mammoth sports store with two things in mind; water shoes for Rickie and new tennies for me. Although the store was full of merchandise, the signage was clear and viseable. BOOM. Men's shoes to the right.

Grabbed Rickie's shoes. Found a pair of $69.99 Asics marked down to $39.99. Tried 'em on. Little slivers of pillow heaven. My toes for the first time spoke to me and said, "Thank you. Thank you, you cheap fool. What took you so long?" Kinda bitchy, but I understood. 

We were asked for help, though never needed it. Arrived at cashier and was asked if we found everything we needed. Yes. Was the answer. There less than 10 minutes.

In N Out. Fast food. Fast shoes. Great service. 

BTW Stevey P...I hear Unique On Central has some rhinestone jock straps...just an FYI.

This is the busiest Walgreens I ever been to, there are good reason why.  First of is located in the Las Vegas Strip, it between Palazzo and Venetian.  Just next to the popular Tao Night Club.  This is the place to get you food, water and other important items restocked.  Eating and drinking is pricey in the Strip, you can save tons of money just shopped here, and just aware that most hotel in the strip does not had microwave or the fridge unless you got a suite type of room.

Price is slight higher than what you fight in most other Walgreen, but is understand since the high cost of the strip in general, even a foot long subway cost $10, but you still manage to find 99 cents Arizona Tea in here.   If you wanted to eat a nice buffet later of the day, this is good place to get you breakfast and late night snack fix without had to spend much.  Save those money can use more in party and gamble =)

It is not difficult for breakfast place to make me happy.   The Park didn't fail.   In fact,  they succeeded at making me a fan.   One of the things I like about this location is that it is steps away from the Wigwam resort.  Just exit the Wigwam from the west gates and walk to the corner of Wigwam and Old Litchfield.  

 The inside of The Park is also very cute with a loft-like feel to it with exposed brick and air ducts.   

I've been here a handful of times and I had the same thing, the Veggie Omelet with the cheese and a side of bacon.  Perfectly cooked omelet each time.  Professional service folks who know and understand the meaning of "service industry".  Many folks love their French Press coffee.  I thought it was a good cup as well.

If you are at the Wigwam and want to get out but not go far, this is a SOLID option for breakfast or lunch!  YOu will enjoy it.

I just realized that I have not yet written a review for my favorite sushi spot on earth! Here it goes!! Although I have not been here in months because I moved on the opposite end of Vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(

WHERE: Located on Rainbow & Robindale

WHAT:  Everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! From the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!

If you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, I suggest AYCE all the way!! Lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!

One of my favorite appetizers is the ahi poke! There's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!

ROLLS:
-Oyshi roll: The first thing you should try! It is their special roll, and the absolute best!!
-Vegas & Sibuya rolls: If I can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor!
-Japanese Lasagna roll: I always have to have my baked roll!!

There are other great rolls, but I can't remember what the names were! So, until next time! I will update soon!

*NOTE: You also get a free dessert with AYCE!! There are the fruit&yogurt parfait, creme brulee, ice cream, or mochi!

McCarran International Airport is about less than a mile a way from the strip hotels so the taxi ride should costs you between $15-$20. This airport is probably the only one that has slot machines and it was first thing I've noticed when I stepped off the plane and into the terminal. I just wish they are not in the area where people wait to board their flights as I find these slot machines in the way and taking up more space than usual.

This airport is clean and well-managed. Not too confusing to navigate around. I hope they upgrade this airport to look more fancy so it matches the rest of Vegas and also upgrade their AC system because it's always hot inside this airport due to many people and the hot weather of course.

When in Rome, eat pizza.

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entre was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.

I really hate to give out my annual award for "Best Response From a Business Owner" this early in the year, but I really do think I've found a winner. Here's most of the message I got in my Yelp inbox from Melody H. about my experience:

"Hi Catherine, I remember when you came in and your horrible attitude. I cannot believe you would be so stupid and make-up lies as you did here. I thought to myself when you came in and spoke with me that you were strange. I just had one thing to say after you left and I told the girls there is only so much lip stick you can put on a PIG!"

It's just pure awesomesauce covered with cherries on top! Congrats to Melody H.--you are truly one in a million (and I mean that in the worst way possible, heh).

This little restaurant is a gem of a find! There might just be a bit of confusion about the name, because the signage in front says "Bisteces", with "Cuban Bakery & Restaurant" appended to it, while their business card (and facebook page) says "Cuban Foods Bakery & Restaurant." 

 I had lunch here with Rand H., Mike C., Scott W., and Jose C. and it was a really enjoyable gathering. Our hostess was so friendly and gracious, and the food was great! We shared some delectable croquetas for appetizers and I ordered my favorite ropa vieja - it was such a savory delight. It came with a side of moros y cristianos - black beans and rice, made even more flavorful with pork cubes (sorry, vegans). I'll let my other friends tell you of their orders in their reviews, but this restaurant is certainly one to return to often - and I will, because it is so near where I live, and the prices are really good.

New look.  New menu.  Same vibe.

Updated contemporary dcor in a dining space where line of sight for celebrity sightings is as important as the LED mood lighting.  High energy, loud, for the young and young at heart.  Quality steaks but, "not your daddy's steakhouse".    

The new menu sees the addition of dry aged beef,  contemporary cuts and steakhouse staples such as a  beautiful braised short rib and a classic 3lb lobster thermidor.

Starters fail to impress.  Secondary to conversation or an after thought kickin it with your buds, the flavors are correct, the presentation OK, no WOW factor.  The fried rock shrimp OK.  Perfectly cooked but the accompanying lemon aioli increases the oily mouth feel.  The lobster pot stickers with bok choy, shitake mushrooms and a chile ginger soy sauce, not memorable.  The king crab and gruyere stuffed shrooms, a tasty bite but the cheese masks the sweetness of the crab.

The steaks.  All USDA prime, wet aged (except he 35 and 50 day dry aged rib eyes), very well trimmed.  Excellent sear.  Even cooking.  Accurate temp.  Standard cuts are, well standard.  Great bone in fillet and porterhouse.  The 35 day dry aged rib steak is tender, and pleasantly nutty with hints of cheesy aroma and a wafting umame finish.  The 50 day, meltingly tender with a pronounced bleu cheese aroma.  Some funkiness at the edges, not for everyone.  The standout, "Barry's Steak".  A simple grilled rib cap.  Tender, packed with flavor.  Served with complementing cipollini onions and shishito peppers.

For entrees, the "Kobe" short rib is excellent.  Not true Kobe beef but, perfectly braised, not stringy, finished with a horseradish crust served with curried root veg and a Cabernet sauce, the earthy flavors marry well.  The lobster thermidor, a classic in every respect.  At three pounds, massive, with firm but still juicy meat enveloped in cream and cheese.  Simply put, good eats.

For sides, the creamed corn, adds a great sweetness to any steak.  The broccoli and cauliflower gratin with a cheddar cheese sauce complements the dry aged steaks umame finish.  The highly touted lobster mashed potato is good but far to rich as a side dish to steaks.  It steals the show.

Very good service.  Steakhouse proper despite the cool vibe of the place.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.

A steakhouse that understands what not having "Las Vegas Blvd" in its address means.  Translated:  it's less expensive, omits baller ingredients but manages to keep the vibe of the Palms.

Little Darlings = FAIL

Heard this place could be a great fun spot for couples & has VIP booths with Hookah's but I guess I'll never REALLY know.

- Called & spoke to Hostess to set up a VIP Booth Package which includes Limo Pick up

- Limo driver called to confirm pick up time (12am)

- Limo driver called 45 min late & apologized he is running behind but he is on his way.

- Hour 1/2 Later Limo driver yet again apologizes and offer's discount on package

- 2 HOURS later.. almost 2am, LIMO driver NEVER SHOWS UP and DOESN'T PICK UP PHONE OR RETURN CALLS.

What pissed me off the most is this was all for my Fiance's Surprise 30th Birthday! Luckily the TOP CLUB of VEGAS "Spearmint Rhino" came through and their Limo picked us up in 5 minutes!

If you want to take your chances and risk getting stood up then by all means go to Little Darlings. But if you want A+ Customer Service in a flash go with Spearmint Rhino instead. 

Your loss Little Darlings... was going to spoil my love rotten that night at your club. :oP

Last night I learned that I should have applied myself to ice skating at a young age. I am a naturally graceful and beautiful figure skater. I skated backwards, I did twirls and even executed a highly skilled jump, and I have not even been on a pair of skates for sixteen years.

The pro shop did not have gloves, but quickly after getting on the ice I realized that I wouldn't need them because I was going to spend my time upright versus laying on the ice like I had anticipating before realizing how highly skilled of a skater I am. 

$8.25 (I think) paid my admission for two hours of skating and got me some sweet rental skates. I really wanted some graceful white ones, but I got brown. Fortunately I had leg warmers to complete my ensemble and tie everything together. Brown has never looked so good with sparkly gray tights before. 

There were plenty of places to pop a squat to put on your skates or take a break and they have lockers to stash your shoes and hand bags. It also appears they have a snack bar and vending machines, but I did not partake in any of those offerings. 

I did, however, partake in some libations at the Ice House, located at the east end of the rink. I love that my friends and acquaintances sat inside the bar sipping their bourbon watching us skaters from the comfort of their warm seats. I'm certain they were too intimidated by my amazing skating skills to join on the ice.

If you thought THAT was impressive, just you wait... I am going to take lessons and next time we have an ice skating #pfn I will blow all of you away with my triple quadruple axle spin jumps.

***This review is for the new TERMINAL 3***

It's been a LONG, LONG time (11 months) since I've flown into LAS (Las Vegas Airport) and wow, such a big upgrade has happened here! I don't even think Terminal 3 existed until recently! No wonder it took a good ten minutes for the plane to park at the terminal after landing (LOL). Upon my arrival from PDX to LAS and stepping into the new terminal, I didn't recognize where I was. 

PERKS
+ New facility
+ Helpful staff (will give you directions if you're lost)
+ Easy to get through TSA
+ Ample room for seats (some handicapped seats)
+ Some slot machines if you want to gamble
+ Bathrooms are equipped for you to place your luggage in the stalls

DIRTS
- Driving around can be confusing for the "passenger pick up" - make sure you read the signs if you're going to pick someone up from Terminal 1 or 3. In addition, you may have to pass through Terminal 1's passenger pick up to get to Terminal 3's passenger pick up. 

Terminal 3 is quite modern and I'm glad LAS got an upgrade for this area. It's a tad of a further drive from the usual Terminal 1 (which I think needs an upgrade), but nonetheless for any domestic flights, you'll be passing through Terminal 3. It's not too shabby and wouldn't mind flying through here again!

On the poz side for PCD
CLEAN! Super, mega clean. Very impressed. I could see my reflection in the shiny floors. And I almost ran into a busboy while admiring myself, but dayum, them was some clean tiles!
FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! Yes, the sandwich experts behind the counter were most polite and efficient. 
On the negativo side for PCD
Well. The sandwich. Ugh. And that's why I"m there. Rye was dry. Pastrami was, um, well, what the hell ryhmes with pastrami. Um, oh, I know....pastrami was no a yummy...OK. I'm trying people. And the slaw. You know what I'm gonna say. The slaw...drum roll please.... WAS BLAH! As in bland. Not sweet. Not sour. Ugh.
On the poz side for CPD....
Well it's in New York baby! What else do you need?

There's a surprisingly fabulous, modern patio at PCD. Seriously worth checking out for a "mall" establishment. I'll go back. Perhaps to try another deli delight. Or maybe to hurl my sandwich in the Koi pond. Even though the sign says not to feed the fish. HA! I'm de elited and a rebel biatches!!!!!

And maybe, just maybe, I'll wear my I HEART NY t shirt.

Was in the area seeking new places to try for lunch and found Crpe Bar , so off I went.  It was Friday little after 11 and the place was busy, but not overly busy, I was able to get my order in and find me a seat. I have to say I love the vibe of this place.

I originally went seeking a savory crpe, but after looking over the menu I went with a savory & sweet crpe. Oh boy, this was not a good diet day. Haha

I ordered the breakfast burrito crpe, eggs, bacon, queso jack, avocado salsa. Let me tell you, this was amazing, it took an entirely different perspective on the breakfast burrito, and the chipotle crpe just made it that much better! The flavors of everything blended perfectly, was surprised when I noticed I ate it all :( where did it go? Who did that?  

I also ordered the first time, I was sold on this because it was with Nutella - that stuff is crack!!! Love it!!!.  The crpe was beautifully prepared it was filled with that glorious Nutella (either you love Nutella or you hate it) and surrounded by mind blowing banana brle OOHHH MMMYYY FFFFFNNNN GGGGGAAAAAWWWWDDD!!! Banana Brle Who thought of this!! Bananas with crispy sugar coating mixed with Nutella!!! Genius!!!! 

Crpe Bar expect to see me on a regularly basis!

Vegas has great gastropubs setting the bar high with innovative food, huge beer selections and cool ambiance.  Public House is OK but fails to hit the stratospheric mark set by others.

Note: This review is for the Midwest chain "Public House " at Luxor NOT the stand alone at the Venetian.  

To the core of the gastropub, the beer.  Weak selection with less than 20 on tap, 20 in bottles.  Very few unique microbrews or craft beers.  PBR and the werewolf killer reign supreme.

The food; aggressive flavors, lots of fatty, fried goodness, just lacking wow factor.   The best sellers: 

Spicy braised short rib tacos.  Spicy, flavorful, braised then shredded short ribs with siracha and greens served with a side of creamy guacamole and salsa.  Delicious but very wet from excessive braising liquid in the taco.

Cheese steak spring roll (steak, chipotle peppers, jalapeno jack cheese all rolled up in a crispy spring roll skin and deep fried golden brown) gooey goodness but one dimensional even with the house made spicy ketchup.

Buffalo shrimp (breaded, deep fried jumbo shrimp with a bleu cheese and buffalo hot sauce) definitely good eats.  Over cooked and rubbery but somehow welcomed as pub grub.  

Filet mignon sliders.  Nice.  Thick cut pieces of medium well filet topped with deeply caramelized onions and bleu cheese in a sweet but somewhat dry Maui onion brioche.  A-OK.

A great place to catch a game.  Fun and friendly service.  Lots of promotions and a great happy hour.  Foodies may want to look elsewhere for a great gastropub experience.

"I'm not in the mood for a Crystal, Diamond, Amber, or Jade at Sapphire.  No, not my Destiny."  I say to laughs from the guys and one "you're a pig" from the lone female in our group.

"You have to call me that because you're a girl". I giggle.  "Oooh, and I want food".

"Fine" she continues.  "let's go to Sparklings".

"Oooh Sparklings". I coo, more laughter from the guys.

"It's not that kind of place... pig" she concludes.

Contemporary meets country sheik.  With it's strong feminine vibe, it's the perfect place for a local, ladies night out.  Guys, you'll understand the appeal.

The food leans towards sensibly portioned Cali cuisine with just right amount of bad for the health to be Vegas.  The classic bacon wrapped dates becomes a delicious bacon wrapped meatball with dates.  No longer bite size, the ground meat a little dry in texture but the combination with the tomato sauce is very good.

Continuing with starters, a warm flatbread smeared with ricotta cheese and overloaded with arugula, halved seedless grapes, and candied walnuts then drizzled with a balsamic reduction is well executed.  A salad you can hold with the right contrast of sweetness to tangy cheese, crunch to tender, bitter greens.  The other standout is the crispy gnocchi served in a pea pure, creamed pesto with bits of Italian sausage and crushed candied walnuts.  Again, it strikes a great textural balance.  The brown butter sage gnocchi is also worthy.  The fries miss the mark.  The Truffle Parm taste of synthetic truffle oil, the Portobello fries, soggy, and the zucchini sticks overly crisp on the outside, overcooked and wet on the inside.

Small list of mains including a loco moco with demi instead of brown gravy (win!)  Tried all, no real standout, no real complaints.

Good, off Strip service.  Very fair prices.

I left feeling happier than a pig in... you get the idea.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Not so much a fan of this airport.  Is it just me, or do you feel like you've landed in 1985 when you get off a plane here?  The furniture and dcor need some serious updating.  And I'm not picky about my airport interior design, but it's just depressing here.  Everything seems so dim and dingy and worn-out.

And despite free WiFi, there is a major dearth of outlets in this airport.  What outlets we could find were dead, too.  Awesome.

And sure, the layout *makes sense,* but does everything have to be so spread out?  You'll be excited to fly into A12 and hear your connecting flight is leaving from A22 only to discover you have to walk a mile to get there.  

There are some good food options, I'll give them that.  I had an excellent burrito at 10 am Phoenix-time, because I was on Eastern-time and starving for lunch, which made people stare at me like I had three heads.  And on the way back through, a bagel breakfast sammie I enjoyed.  You know you're a Yelper when you remember airports by meal.

A coworker tried to make out with my boyfriend at happy hour here and I still freaking love it! I mean, what a great time, right? Sake bombers, sushi, random drunk broads coming on to your boyfriend because you spent too much time playing with the toilet controls in the bathroom?  Seriously girls, be careful in there.

Thankfully, my boyfriend did not give in to Drunky McSluttersons advances. However, the fact that she even had the gall to attempt it is really a testament to how awesome Geisha A Go Go's happy hour is. Chick was wasted. Hard not to get drunk when everything on the damn drink menu is half off! I think we were drinking $3 beers and $1 Sakes. $1! Truly wonderful.

The "House Maki" is half off also, which usually means basic rolls like California and Tuna, but nothing fancy. Geisha A Go Go's "House Maki" includes quite a few of the fancier roll selections, including one of my faves, the rainbow roll.  The sushi is really nothing to write home about, but when you got a nice buzz going on with aforementioned $1 Sakes, you don't really notice.

To recap: Happy Hour is awesome, Sushi is Okay, Bathrooms are time consuming, Don't take slutty coworkers.

I guess the bloom is off the rose a bit.

A year ago, when I told our Wisconsin friends that Culvers was opening restaurants down here, they collectively yawned.  Now it's been almost a year since the PV store opened and maybe seven months for this location.  Culver's still gets busy during lunch and dinner, but things have slowed down in a big way.  Maybe it was just the Portillo's effect? Maybe.

Culver's is basically a good frozen custard place that does a nice business with burgers and fries.  Yes, there are Rubens and Chicken sandwiches as well, but they're known for their custards, which are delicious.

On the hamburger front as I said they do a nice job...  but...  you knew there was going to be a but in here someplace right?  Well, the hamburgers are.. greasy.  I was here recently with some out of town friends and their napkins were soaked.  One actually removed the top of the bun to tap it dry.

So after nearly a year, I'll take a pass here and go back to my Animal Style.

This review could go either way. Part of me wants to give it 5 stars...but in the interest of helping people, I had to be honest, not ironic :-(

This joint is FABULOUSLY atmospheric if you're looking for a place to settle down for a crack binge...or if, as I was, you are looking for a gross, shitty motel room in which to do a photo shoot. But if you're just looking for a clean, safe place to stay in Vegas....there are plenty of vastly superior options -- and for cheaper, too!

CONS: As the other reviewers mention, the place is shitty, roach-infested, grungy and in a crummy part of town populated by crackheads and whores (and people who "smoke pots"). The a/c units wheeze and groan and don't fit properly; the doorknobs are loose, and the bathrooms are pretty janky.

PROS: The place has history -- it's been around since the 1940s or so, and thousands of wads have been blown in its hallowed rooms. And that's just since June!! 

The best part about the Desert Moon Motel is, the TVs in the rooms offer FREE 24-hour XXX movies. During my brief one-hour stay (one of MANY brief, one-hour stays in its history, LOL), the TV happened to be showing a clown (in full circus regalia) fingerbanging an Asian chick with a full, 1980s bush. At the end, instead of jizzing on her....he covered her bush with Silly String!!!!!!

I just don't see getting that kind of ambiance at the Bellagio. I mean, there's dancing fountains.....and then there's jizzing clowns. 

Which would YOU prefer?!!

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

I just got a hankering for a Vegas trip again, which reminded me that I never reviewed Triple 7. How can that be? Oh yeah, it's probably because I had a few too many of those amazing microbrews and had a slight lapse in memory. 

I had some Vegas pals always telling me that this was THE place to go for cheap dinner and amazing beer, and I always would reply, "Don't bother me. I'm playing blackjack." Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went. And we were pretty famished (and sober) when we arrived, so we went to town on that menu...Meatball sliders, garlic fries, nachos grande, Prime Rib ($10!!), and, of course the microbrew sampler - you get five 5oz pours for $5. Can't beat that!

When the food starting arriving all six of us got a look of dread in our eyes, thinking, "Dear lord, what have we done?" If Vegas is about excess, than we sure as hell were doing something right, because this was a MASSIVE amount of food...and mostly pretty damn cheap and amazingly tasty too. 

The beer? Ah, the beer. It's so good when it hits your lips. It really is. The Porter was my fave, but the night we went there was also a brewmaster's special that had upwards of 9% abv...I think that was the one that really did me in. We left that place full, tipsy, and more than satisfied. Can't wait to do it again.

This Fry's is even better than the one on Shea and 90th Street!

A while back, I expounded on the transformation that has taken place over at their Shea location.  Well, this too is fun to go to and a wonderful grocery shopping experience.  It appears to have been built from the ground up. and is a well thought out alternative to Basha's upscale AJ's brand.

Even though we been shopping here for five years, I wouldn't even be able to guess the store's dollar volume. But it has to be high, since they have just about everything you could ever want in a grocery store.  The aisles are wider and appear longer than the usual store.  They are also broken up in the middle to allow you to move between them.  

The wine selection is excellent and very diverse.  If it's not here, they will order it for you.  They also have a very good wine sommelier.  All very nice!  Also like the 90th Street store they have a wine tasting and cheese area.  Imagine, wine tasting, sushi, cheese, all in a grocery store.  It's like a mini upscale restaurant!

I particularly like the Tully's coffee (see separate review) sitting area. It's setup reminds of a Gold Passport floor at a Hyatt Regency, with HDTV, comfy chairs and a newspaper rack.

Enjoy!

I'm not demanding when I go to a theatre; all I ask is that the chairs are clean, the floors aren't sticky, and that the screen is big, bright, and easy to see--whether you're in the neck-breaker seats up front, or the make-out bunkers in back.

Anyway, Archie, I already know the tickets and snacks will be a ripoff; that's just standard practice, whether you're at the movies, ball game, or drinking flat intermission champagne at some sad, community theatre production of Hamlet.

Harkins Fashion Square 7 meets my diva requirements just as well as any other theatre. It's attached to a mall, and you enter through the mall, too. So, conceivably, you could sneak the slightly-cheaper food from the food court into the movies, if your purse, backback, or 1992-ish raver pants are big enough.

Skinny jeans? Forget it. That freezing, 20 ounce bottle of Coke Zero is going to make me sterile. I mean YOU sterile. 

You.

Me and my David Schwimmers are maverick, dangerous, and NEVER on a break.

Dangerous, I tell you!

Anyinsecure...

The clientele at this theatre is typically quiet, young adult, and suburban. You won't get too much cellphone ringing, talking, crying babies in R-rated movies, or late-comers stepping on your new Jordans as they go for the middle seats.

Overall, a decent theatre, but I docked one star because the red-vest-wearing guy who sold a box of Mike and Ikes to me seemed really methed out, and he kept scratching at invisible scabs, swatting at imaginary dragons, and warning me not to let the White man hold me down.

He was White, too, and I know one employee doesn't represent a company in totality, but it was creepy, and I'm a total bitch.


Harkins Fashion Square 7

Cleanliness = More than Fair
Movie Selection = Stellar
Snack Choices = Michelle Gellar
Employees = Mostly Groovy, some Ghoulie
People Who Yell at the Screen = Few
People Having Sex Between Scenes = Far Between
Chances of Sneaking In = Maybe, if you're born with it

I wish I could rate this place with 0 stars. 

Came here to see Hardwell and W&W for EDC week. My host put me under a guestlist and said to come by 10 because we had a group of guys. The rate they told us was $75 for males and 0 cover charge for the ladies. We got there before 10, and asked the guys with the suits with the mini ipads about the rates and they had said the same. fast foward 2 hours and we finally reach the front of the line to only be told  guys were $170 and ladies were $66. 

....are you serious? We could've just bought tickets, but the host personally said that he would put us on guest list and we would be able to get in with no problem. 

Anyways, we were trying to make a decision to pay the fee or not, another guy in a suit with the ipad in his hand shoved us out of the line yelling, "step off the line if you're not paying". Uh, hello. You clearly see us discussing if we want to pay or not. Not even a half second later, the same guy grabbed me and threw me off the line telling us off. Where is the professionalism? TRAIN YOUR STAFF PLEASE.

After what I went through with the staff,  I don't think I will ever come here again.

After reading the discussions in Talk and seeing some recommendations for Pisces, I thought we would give it a try. Even though it was early lunch time when we arrived, there was a good vibe coming off the place. The large bar area and the private booths in the back looked very comfy, but we took seats in the middle of the dining room.

Opting for the all-you-can-eat, the sushi is prepared when it is ordered as opposed to the buffet-style at other places. A handful of hot plates (noodles and such) are complimented by a few different nigiri-sushi, (salmon, tamago, mackerel, etc) and a dozen or so temaki rolls. Don't expect anything earth shattering, but the stuff that they do offer is good, quality sushi that isn't nearly all rice.

Our waitress was quite attentive, refilling sodas before they were empty and getting our sushi orders before the plate was gone.

Is it the best in Charlotte? Maybe not. Is it the best ayce in Charlotte? Possibly.

When I tell people where I grew up they often respond with "I didn't know people grew up in Las Vegas." True, it's a transient town but whenever I get together with fellow natives I find it hard to resist the pull of the buffet. 

This much I've learned: Atlantans have fried chicken. New Yorkers have bagels. Bostonians have lobster rolls. And we Las Vegans have the buffet. Though I managed to be in LV for less than 48 hours, I made sure a trip to the buffet with a couple of old friends was on my itinerary.

On Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes in line for the chance to gorge ourselves on prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamy corn chowder, soft serve ice cream with Butterfinger pieces on top, shrimp, roast turkey with gravy, slices of cheese, sushi, grapefruit segments, champagne and a lot more that I cannot recall at the present moment.

But as I dug into my plate I looked across the table at my friends and said, "Now I feel like I'm home. . ."

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

Unbelievably rude service. I came here on a Sunday with two friends and we were the first people in the restaurant. We waited at the front for a while and the servers were too busy chatting with each other to acknowledge us so we sat ourselves. Once our server realized we had sat ourselves she had the audacity to tell us to in a very condescending tone to "wait for the hostess in the future". Again, we were the only people there. Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?

We got up and left, and I will not return. Switch has been officially scratched off my list of Sunday brunches for this ridiculous behavior and I will be sure to tell anyone who suggests we visit in the future.

500 or 900 degrees.  60 or 180 seconds.  Yup, great Italian style pizza.

The pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.

Tried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive "stuff" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).

It's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect "octopussy" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).

The mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.

50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  

Bottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time.

I honestly believe that clubs are only fun and enjoyable if YOU make it that way. With that being said, Pure sucks, but my girlfriends and I managed to make it fun and enjoyable for us.

We knew one of the promoters, so we got in for free. I think that's the ONLY good thing about that night. Sad, I know.

Let's list out some of the reasons why Pure was a huge disappointment.

1. The bouncers are beyond rude (more than usual). 
2. I don't get it, why did we have to wait in line when we were on the guestlist? Someone please enlighten me.
3. There was no room to even breathe on the first floor, let alone dance -_-
4. The crowd is a lot older than I had anticipated.
5. Pure attracts MORE creepers than other clubs I've been to. I seriously felt like I was being raped by this one perv on the dance floor.

Pure, it was nice knowing ya, but let's just end it here. Don't want to come back to you ever again.

Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:

"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. 
Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"

It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.

Wrap me up and take me home ZiKiZ. Your food is BoMb. (I don't know why their name has a capital K in the middle. I almoSt wAnT to wriTe the WhOle rEviEw this way, but I'm too full now.)

Back to the wraps. Your choice of Steak, Chicken or Crab mix or Falafel and 4 types of tortillas you can wrap it in. Or if you aren't a wrapper you could make it into a salad or a bowl. This is your meal so make your food dreams come true. 

Add: spinach, rice (white or brown), lettuce mix, olives, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno, pickles, cucumbers, chick peas, green peppers, banana peppers, avocado, feta or mozzarella ($.99 extra for cheese), crumbled ZiKiZ chips. 

Dressing: I want to try them all! A house dressing that's good, Chipotle Ranch, Asian BBQ, Citrus, Hot Sauce, Mango Curry, Caesar, Vinaigrette. I only wish they had a Tzatziki sauce.

Wraps $7.99
Salads $8.49
Bowls $8.49 (they even have Tabouli!)

This is one of those meals that you can make healthy or kill it with the carbs depending your mood that day. I like that. Did I mention they have a cheesecake wrap? Tubby didn't try that, but it sure sounded good especially since you can choose chocolate, lemon or strawberries as your topping. Might as well rip the drawstring out of your pants to make some more room. 

I ordered online and like the fact they have the nutritional guidelines on there. Not that I even want to know about the cheesecake wrap.... Wait, strawberries are an exceptional source of antioxidants:) 

If you haven't got the memo yet ZiKiZ is doing it big up in here. Fresh, simple and have it your way. If you like to be your own boss of what you eat than check it out.

Il Posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects.

The outside patio area is completely awesome. It's like you're sitting in a little Italian cafe, with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style European building. There are Christmas lights strung about in different locations, a small bar area, a lil fountain and some other cool decorations. It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area, if only to have some drinks.

The service was awesome. Our waiter was totally cool, friendly and accommodating. 

The fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. Loved it.

They had local beer (Kiltlifter) on tap for only $3 a pint. awesome.

The salads and pasta entrees were just ok, which is the reason behind my 3 star rating. I just wasn't wowed by the main course. We'll definitely be back to try them again though, perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas. I predict a review sequel in my future.

I just got done with one of those intense workouts at 24hr Fitness.  I admit, I was so spent after the session that I was barely awake by the time we were done. Then I hear the words "baby, I'm taking you to paradise tonight".  Well, that's one way to wake me up with the quickness. Only obvious with what I was thinking.  But moted I was. The gurlpren meant she's taking me to Paradise Boba Tea and Smoothie for our post workout treat.  Hah...good trick to boost my energy and it worked.  

Paradise is a family owned business that sells boba, milk teas, smoothies, and even some food.  I didn't even know this place existed, but it's here.  Here in Summerlin tucked in the shopping center across from 24hr Fitness.  The owners here are so nice and even threw some compliments our way. And who doesn't love compliments?  Well anyways, I had their Mocha & Peanut Butter Smoothie w/Boba. The combination of mocha and peanut butter meant a really sweet treat.  I thought it was also too thick, but that should be expected, especially with the flavors I chose.  The boba was warm and silky smooth, which only enhanced the smoothie.  Overall, not bad at all and for an additional cost, you can even have whey protein added to it. But I didn't stop there. I had to try their spam masubi.  The spam masubi was a little small, but still packed a punch with flavor.  In other words, I wasn't disappointed with it.  

I'm giving Paradise 4 stars for location, service, and taste.

Jt's Bar & Grill is exactly what I have been looking for in the Valley! Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! 
I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). 
They have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want! This place is def going to be apart of my repertoire and it should be for you too!

So much potential for this place. They have been only open for a few months so obviously there needs to be room for tweaking. But, it is what it is and I have to give an honest opinion. 

The owners get their ice cream from Treat Ice cream company in San Jose. Treat has a ridiculous yelp rating over there. That means it should be 5 stars as well.. Not exactly.

Taste wise, only a couple flavors really put me away, the tin roof sundae and the taro. I forgot what was in the TRS, but there were a whole lot of goodies that went extremely well together. Let's talk about the taro, or as I like to call it, them taro ice cream... Probably the best taro ice cream I ever had! It was well balanced, smooth, and the taro flavor was very pronounced.

So what up wit da 3 stars u say?? Well, most of the ice creams that are served there are extremely icy! You can actually hear the crunch if you chew it. Not only does that distract from the flavor, but it is very unpleasant as well. I checked the reviews for Treat Ice Cream and they don't seem to have this problem. I don't know if this is due to the transportation of the ice cream or from the storage. But, all the flavors are really well balanced.. The texture is off.

The employees are nice and the store is well maintained. I would come back here just for the taro.

I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.

"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it. " - Lawrence J. Peter.

After having Short Leash numerous times at events around the valley, I finally gotten around to visiting their place and boy am I full!  Strolled in today after a dramatic parking adventure with Linh L. and we ordered a delicious meal.  Between the two of us, we had a root beer, a ginger ale, corn dog bites, the Igby, and the Sunny.  Our bill came out to about $30 before tip for the both of us.  Admittedly, it's a bit of a splurge for wieners on naan bread but hey, it's Friday, I paid my student loans, and I wanted some good eats.  It's always good eats with Short Leash!  The Bear caught my eye but I was thinking I wanted something with some greens.  That Sunny... pure bliss.  It had pear with some honey, prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula, cracked black pepper, with a chicken wiener on fluffy warm naan bread.  Savory-sweet [with a hint of bitterness from the arugula]  wins me over every time.  I think it's more than just puppy love...

Other yummy items that have crossed these lips:  The Bear, Mac Daddy, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, the pimento cheese dip, and the brat-stuffed pretzel.  Yum!  Try to save room for their dessert items.  If I didn't feel like passing out right on the spot from that food coma, I would have loved to split the orange-glazed and pistachio doughnut or the maple and candied bacon.  Gimme gimme!  More reason to arrange lunch again with some friends, right?  *cough, hint, cough* Mike W., Laz C., Brett B., Melodie C., Meghan L., and Linh L.

Lessaiz Les Bon Temps Rouler in Viva Las Vegas,

Came here for dinner with the BFF's to celebrate all of our belated birthday's. I've actually dined at several of Emeril's establishment and have been here twice before.  Each time I enjoyed a very good meal here.  

We started off with drinks and shared 2 different salads which were very good.

Pork chop was my entree http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#LC_f_i6ryK2FE9A0o1iX_A  This sounded really good and it was very good.   A nice double cut pork chop atop a very creamy and flavorful mashed potato. The sauce that accompanied the chops was perfect I wanted more of it.  It was a pretty big piece of pork chop.

Banana cream pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#JmSeIq-NF3TojwbkY71V9A  For dessert it is a must for me to get the Banana cream pie.  I first had it at Delmonico's in New Orleans and ever since the first bite many many years ago, if its on the menu at any Emerils resto I'm ordering it.  As you can see it not just all custard but it has slices of fresh banana's and the custard is firmer.  Its just tasty bite after bite!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#4j2ZIrDR8_5Jkwid9ahUqA

A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing. 

We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.

Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.

The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House.

Goodwich!..Great!...Grilled!...Gourmet!...Grinders!...well not really grinders, grilled sandwiches, but the fingers were set on typing "G" words for this strong 4-star establishment.

the Goodwich is located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Wyoming, a small free standing food shack in the Dino's parking lot.  They are billed as "STACKED-RITE SANDWICHES" and I agree!

I had the pleasure of trying the "Le Pig" and the Foie.  These are both wonderful options.   the Le Pig (or le The Porc if you prefer) is full of flavor!  It is pork belly with a truffled vinaigrette, crunchified chip pieces, and fontina. The Foie was rich for sure with some fine foie gras mousse, cabbage, carmalized (balsamic?) onions and pieces of almond for taste,and texture.

I saw a grilled cheese with a fried egg that looked inciting.  They also will do any sandwich monte cristo style for $.50.  There are lots of elevated foodie options going on here!  I hope this place does well...Dino's a great dive bar, but I'm not sure if the patrons will appreciate the more sophisticated option at the Goodwich.  I also wonder how grilled sandwiches will go over during the heat of the day as the weather warms...maybe check them out at night.  Either way, come down here and don't hesitate to try anything on the menu that sounds good to you.

You can also text 702-910-8681 for curbside pickup or Dino's delivery.

This Jersey Mike's in located in kind of a cramped shopping center. I've stopped by this location a couple times now and and am glad to have a decent place to grab a sandwich for lunch when in the area. The employees inside are nice. I don't always remember my Shore Points Card, which accumulates points with each of my purchases towards free food, so it's nice that I can just give my phone number and they can look it up easy that way. I don't know if this is the only location that does it because I haven't seen it at other locations, but currently they offer a daily lunch special from 11 am to 3 pm that costs $6.99 and gets you any regular sub and drink. 

I like the "Original Italian" and "Club Sub" the best. Mike's way of course! The Italian has 6 different meats. I'd rather pay a couple dollars more to eat subs here rather than Port of Subs or Subway because the meats, breads and cheeses just taste better. They also had some "Chocolate Chip Cookies" which I never knew they had, so I got some and they are good!

You can place your order over the phone or online (you have the option to enter your shore rewards points online) for convenient pick-up.

Dropping my rating from a two star to a one star DISASTER!

I just wrote a review for the Citizens Kitchen & Bar last week.  I mentioned that the waiter George was "AMAZING!"   I retract my statement.  He is unethical and unprofessional.  He automatically included an 18% tip in our bill (see my original review) and not tell us about it (he got a 40% or an $80 tip on a $210 total bill).   We would have been OK with the 18% tip for a party of 8, but just tell us about it so we wouldn't double tip you!

We just checked our credit card statements, and George DOUBLE CHARGED us when we asked him to split our bills.  This means that he charged us 150% for our food and drink bill!  UNETHICAL!  Here's a summary of this horrible restaurant:

1)  We weren't told that Waiter George included an 18% tip on our bill.
2)  We added an additional 20% tip, raising his tip to $85+ on a $210 bill.
3)  We were charged an additional 50% for our food, bringing our total charge to $300+ on a food tab of $168.
4)  To top it off, the food is HORRIBLE here!

AVOID!  Shame on the owners and wait staff of Citizens Kitchen & Bar!  We're working with the credit card companies to resolve this mess!

Another awesome Cirque du Soleil show.  This one features acrobatic performers and water.  I'm always amazed at how they can pull off all of these moves in such an elegant and choreographed way.  My hat's off to the performers!

I don't want to give away too much, but this show will simply amaze you.  It's worth seeing more than once.  There's no way I can keep my eye on everything going on.  Every time I see this show I see something different.

Definitely worth the time and money while you're in Vegas.  When out of town visitors ask me what show to see when they're in Vegas, I mention this one as one of the Top 5 in town.

Will I return?  Can't wait for the next time!

Even though I informed every stripper that approached me that I am gay and not interested, two of them proceeded to give me simultaneous lap dances against my will. I told them to stop, but I couldn't exactly push them off of me without getting into trouble with security. Then they had the nerve to charge me. Yes, I was at a strip club, so I kind of brought this all on myself, but I feel the need to comment because, geez, if the strippers are that pushy with an openly gay dude I can't imagine how pushy they would be with a straight dude who didn't want a lap dance. 

There are guy strippers upstairs but the club has a strick "NO GAYS" policy, so gay guys really aren't welcomed here. If you have a group of ladies/bachelorette party and plan on inviting gay friends, you should call ahead and make sure they will be allowed in with you upstairs (perhaps OG might make exceptions if notified in advance, but I honestly doubt it).

Maybe its just me, but can we get with the times people? It's 2013; gays and straights hang out together. I'm not saying cater to gay people, just make us feel reasonably welcomed if we come with a straight group.

With suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??

NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!

FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.

BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!

CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!

SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

This is a great , intimate, and special gem of a place with fantastic creations from the James Beard award winning chef, Nobuo, in the Heritage Square's Teeter house, a historical old house with hardard floors and simple understated elegance, all in the heart of DT PHX. 

In what could be described as Izakaya Fusion small plates, or what one might call "Japa Tapas",  made with attention to detail, flavor and texture, at reasonable prices, this place was part of Phoenix  Yelp's Eats Week recently, with rave reviews from Yelp Foodies.

In a cozy, quiet room with only 4 tables, with dark hardwood floors and minimal decorations, the two of us split the following:

Small Bites
Kimchi ($6) - napa cabbage, dried shrimp, seasme oil, red chili. 
Instead of the Korean staple fermented and limp, this was fresh cabbage with a lively flavor, crisp and crunchy, as a salad rather than a pickled side dish. Excellent!

Nasu ($8) - eggplant, bacon, red miso, Tokyo negi - this small bacon wrapped morsels stuffed with eggplanbt and akamiso, with shaveed green onions. (8 small pieces) Heavenly! 

Others not tried: Shishito Pepper, Watermelon Goat Cheese salad, Tempura Squash Blossom (All $10 or less)

Cold Dishes
Yellow Tail Ceviche ($14) - myouga, sesame seed, sherdded taro - a superb blend of textures from the Hamachi to the Taro shavings, caressing the palatte with sultry pleasure (4 pieces)

Tako and Tomato ($16) - fresh grilled octupus, house made mozzarella - like a mini-Italian Caprese appetizer, with half a cherry tomato, a small ball of mozzarella, a touch of basil, and a scored, pounded, grilled tender piece of white octupus! Outrageous yet comforting in its combining recognition with a new ingredient! 

Others not tried: House cured Salmon, Ebi Salad, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Shiromi Carpaccio, Big Eye Tuna Tataki (all $12 - $16)

Warm Dishes
Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich ($12) -  housemade focaccia, cucumber, kanzuri aioli - this is not your daddy's crab sandwich! Crispy soft shell, great aioli, a mouth watering delight!

Seabass & Mushroom ($14) - seabass baked in parchment, garlic butter, sake, soy - delicate, flaky seabass soaking in a hearty sauce, on a bed of shitaki and enoki mushrooms, with a sweet sake, butter and onion base, tender, yet dripping with exciting goodness like a goddess in heat!

Others not tried: Okonomiyaki ($8) - classic Kansai pancake favorite! 
Pork Belly Buns, Fried Sodt Shell Shrimp, Warm Duck Salad, Yuan Yaki, Foie Gras, Coconut Curry Lamb, (all $10 - $24)

Dessert
Chcolate Mouse with Green Tea Ice cream and chocolate syrup

This is a terrific date place, intimate and romantic, or a Foodies orgasm, and all at reasonable prices for the quality of creations and food. We had 2 small bottles of Junmai Sake ($12 eacch) but they have a huge selction of sakes going up to near $600 a bottle, as well as a good selction of beers. Relaxed atmoshere, not hoity toity at all, not attitudes, very down to earth. 

This is an excellent choice! And of my many reviews, only 10% or less get 5 stars from Wanugee, so you can trust my viewpoint and bell curve!

After a long and tumultuous affair with Buffalo Exchange (first visit, circa 1993), I've had it with them. I brought a bunch of OK stuff (neatly folded, clean, and wrinkle-free) in a laundry basket as well as a couple of worn but still very desirable and in fashion Tory Burch shoes. As soon as I saw the overweight rockabilly chick doing the buying, I knew I was screwed. Those girls, with the dyed black hair, Bettie bangs, red lipstick, and loss of sense of time, are universally angry and aggro.

Rockabilly went through all my shit and proceeded to wad it up into crumpled balls after she pissed on it as being too uncool or from the wrong store or whatever. She put her powdered nose waaay up in the air over the Tory Burch's, sniffing that they had soooo many already for sale. OK, I didn't see a single pair, but I did see all kinds of nasty Target and Old Navy items that would have probably been more appropriate for a Maryvale garage sale. I didn't even find a single thing that maybe I would consider trying on. Garbage.

So I go to the counter to get my ID back and collect my cash and I am so pissed that all the rejected stuff was now wrinkled all to hell. They gave me something like $80 for the stuff they deigned to take and they had to write me a check. Really? You don't have $80 in cash in the register? The giggling dingbat behind the counter said she had to find the manager to sign said check. While she's gone, I'm steaming and am ready to ask to speak to said manager about the shoddy way the rejects were tossed back into the laundry basket....

....but the manager turned out to be Rockabilly.

Sigh.

So instead, pointing to the basket, I suggested to the Giggler that, should they ever have, like, a staff meeting, maybe they should discuss taking the extra three seconds to fold someone's things to resemble their original condition. She giggled and handed my check over and acted as if I hadn't said a word.

Unbelievable.

I don't care how young you are, how punk rock you think you are, or how badass you think you are. You treat your customers like CUSTOMERS.

Bye-bye, Buffalo... it's been a long and painful road.

Triple D Stamped. 

Fried Oysters reeled me in. My aunt suggested this place and a fried oyster po'boy sounded good to me! Bun- super soft, lots of fried yumminess. I split a sandwich with my mom so i could have room for their famous bananas' fosters bread pudding. 

as i write this review, i just fcking realized that i didn't get their famous banana fosters BREAD PUDDING, but their plain banana's fosters. I guess i was still suffering from the 8 hour traffic jam we were stuck in earlier and maybe a bit hypnotized by the cutie server we had, but yeah, i ended up with a dessert i didn't order. I didn't love it either, but i'm sure i would have loved their bread pudding version Damn it!!! 
I guess i'll have to make my way back to get that dessert one day!

Here are a few of my favorite Timo things:
~ The brunch flat bread ($10): bacon, eggs, burrata - the crust has the perfect, ever-so-slight salty crunch that is perfectly complimented by the toppings. I would eat this for breakfast, lunch OR dinner!
~ The mimosa flight: a steal at $9 with samples of orange, grapefruit and cranberry & St. Germain. Shockingly (to me anyway), my favorite is the grapefruit!
~ La fin du monde golden (beer -9% alc.) $6 here, now also found in my fridge at home! Thanks for the introduction!!
~ The day drinker ($9) a magical grapefruit flavored adult beverage and the Irish Sour ($): trust, don't be afraid of the egg white. ($6 at Happy Hour!)
~ That they're always cooking up different things in the wood fired oven - from bacon and eggs to fish and lasagna! 

These are just a few... there's a lot to love about Timo!

Over the years, I've enjoyed the Montelucia amentities (spa, restaurants), but it wasn't until recently that I got to experience the Montelucia as an overnight resort guest. When my friend got engaged and decided that she'd like her bachelorette party in Arizona, I immediately knew that the Montelucia was the perfect resort for the large bachelorette party. 

We originally booked a suite but upon arrival, they gave us the surprise of the year. The presidential suite was available and therefore they decided to upgrade us to the Presidential suite for no additional charge. At first I thought I was dreaming. Could it be true that they upgraded us to the house that had it's own private backyard and pool? But in fact it was true! 

Now it's pretty obvious that the Presidential Suite is going to be gorgeous, and this was no exception. It was a large house with a kitchen, living room, dining room, study, master bedroom and second bedroom, along with three bathrooms. The patio had a gated pool, with several lawn chairs, grass and other tables. It was definitely the most extravagant resort "room" I've ever (and ever will) stay in. 

Besides the beautiful amenities, the service was above and beyond. We were situated further back on the property and the hotel staff were very attentive and helpful throughout the weekend. Everything was pretty much perfect all weekend. 

Besides the hotel itself, Montelucia has two great restaurants, two amazing pools and a full equipped spa. It's a must-visit property!

The Blue Adobe serves excellent  Santa Fe and New Mexican cuisine.

Sorry, there's no Tex-Mex, or piled high nachos or sizzling fajitas here.  New Mexican food focuses on Hatch green chiles and what they call a Christmas Tree sauce, that is half red and green.  

In New Mexico they put the green chile in and on almost everything, from bagels to burgers*.  You can even get dried red New Mexico chile pepper pod as Christmas ornaments in Santa Fe!

The Blue Adobe was founded by Chef Jose Leyva. It was his ability to deliver spice while maintaining incredible flavor that makes Blue Adobe different. As they advertise: "Our Fire Wood Grille uses Pecan Wood and our Chilies are Hatch."

One of the hallmark of Blue Adobe is their Fire-roasted Salsa and tri-color chips. These are so popular, you can order a 27 oz jar to take some home. On our most recent trip, we started off with this, along with an order of Guacamole ($5.95). 

One of us had their shredded beef Chimichanga ($14.95).  Very flavorful and not overly spicy. We also tried their High Desert Pasta ($13.95), which had a delicious EVOO garlic and Asiago sauce, served on a Tortilla (photo).  

For dessert, we had a New Mexican favorite of sopapillas with honey.  It's a very special puff dessert for only $1.50, and is not on the menu.

Our bill, including three drinks came to a fair $66.73 including taxes, but before tip.  Everything was delicious and exquisite. And, yes we're a fan of the Blue Adobe!

Enjoy!

I have created a Santa Fe and Taos list, if you would like to know more about the area and cuisine:

If you want to experience the REAL Vegas, go north on the Strip til you pass the Stratosphere. That's when the REAL fun starts: strip clubs, porn stores, pawn shops and derelicts! Don't be a puss -- check it out!

The jewel of this portion of LV Blvd is Showgirl Video, an adult store with a moderate-to-severe case of the grunge. Bare concrete floors, rack and racks of DVDs with titles like "German Piss-Orgy," dirty magazines and an assortment of dildos, dongs and pocket pussies to enjoy them with.

The walls are lined with ass- and tit-imprints from some of the world's biggest names in porn -- just like at Hollywood's Chinese Theater! Even better, in the back of the store, you can pay $1 to go through a turnstile to a little peepshow area. A marquee shows you who's dancing today -- usually about 4 different girls. Then enter a booth, insert $5, and the shade goes up to reveal who's on duty at that particular moment. It's like a crapshoot -- will it be a scabrous Russian? A meth-addled Floridian?? You never know at Showgirl!!

If the girl really turns your crank, you can pay extra and take her down the hall to the Private Peep area: a series of little booths where she will dance for your eyes only. A menu is posted out front: "Anal $60, Anal w/toy $80," etc. It's a riot!

All in all, a truly unforgettable experience. And, girls -- if you're down on your luck, they'll let ANYONE dance here...even just for a day or two. On my visit, the manager told me about these two co-eds from Colorado on Spring Break, who had lost all their money gambling and needed to earn cash to get home. They wandered into Showgirl with their bikinis, and in three short days they had earned bus fare back to Denver.

This little parable tells me one of two things.. either the bus is a LOT more expensive than I remembered... or there ain't much money in peepshow dancing!!!

I had the chance to enjoyed a nice lunch with Yelp Buffet King Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C, Norm R and Ursula D. Our group had a fun time sharing stories and getting to know each other. 

The food was a bit uneven, though good. The best was the Tangerine Chicken (chunks of white breast meat), their Carving Station (Sirloin Tri-tip) and the Gelato (Caramel Chip). All would rate a Four Star if judged individually and the rest was "A-OK". 

In the end, I wanted to like this place more than I did, given its upscale nature, and almost Las Vegas like Buffet features. I've cheated a little, giving them Four Stars for effort, but only Three Stars on execution.  Given YELP'S Rating Distribution Trend graph, Wandering Horse is off their game and in the Three/Four Star range after a solid opening.

I agree with friends and fellow Yelpers, Monica J, Pepper T, Heather C and Aileen B that Wandering Horse is good, but it could be better.  The tab came to $15.20 including taxes, but before gratuities.

Like I said, it's Three Stars, A-OK.

My friend found this small Moroccan grocery and invited me to stop by for dinner. The interior consists of a grocery and clothing section, and a tiny dining area. There was not much of ambiance as we were the only visitors on that evening. It's a one-person operation and the owner does everything from kitchen to the floor. 

The Harira ($3.99) came with lentils, tomatoes, garbanzo beans and cilantro soup. The blend of ingredients and spices made it zesty hearty with a good lift stemming from a mix of lentil and cilantro. It was a light opener and one item to consider for those looking for soups. 

The Baba Ghannouge ($4.99) came with baked eggplant, sesame sauce, garlic, and lemon. The thick eggplant consistency was garlicky and addictive. The zesty lemony flavor nicely intertwined with the deepening sesame sauce. However, the bursts of eggplant flavors were held in check and in need to be more striking.

The Bamiah ($12.99) was put together with a large bulky piece of simmered lamb, saffron, okra, and a combination of spices. The okra was very tasty and nicely stewed. The outer-layer of the lamb had some dry spots, but otherwise it was tender and easy to fork into. The mix of spices could also be more intense and integrated. It was missing one note that could have brought it all together. 

The Goat Tagine ($14.99) was culminated by a large bulky piece of goat with the bone in, saffron, and spices. The goat too, had some dry spots on the outside, but it was still very tender and easy to fork into. The aroma was sensational, but I wished the goat were seasoned better.

Overall, the food was solid but not spectacular. There were some minor wow factors stemming from the soup and the wonder aroma of meat and spices. Despite the missing notes that could serve as a bridge between the meat and broth, but the drizzles were still very tasty when served on top of our generous servings of rice. 

Service was very personable and friendly. It goes without saying, but the one-person operation will cause the food to take some time to arrive. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their good-looking Bastilla.

When we first moved here six years ago, we really liked going to Flo's. Their dishes were tasty and interesting to the pallet.

The two of us came for a late lunch and thought wow, things have gotten very expensive and the food was just okay. 

I agree with everything my friend Marvin A wrote in his updated review just a few months ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=TJuxgsGDqv6OjBCHJk7gpw   Also, my friend Scott D brings up some very good points as well. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=l4MSDHKXs1IDBvKn1TjaHQ  So I call your attention to both of their reviews. 

It seems Flo's no longer has a Luncheon Menu, only smaller portions of their regular dinner menu. We decided to start off with some pork Pot Stickers for $5.00. We were vanquished, so I decided to ordered two (if only to have some for later, or so I thought). These however were minis, barely half the normal size (see photo) and bland

Our lunch entrees were Chicken with Cashew for $9.00 and the Chicken Asian Peanut sauce over noodles for $11.50 (photos). Both were okay, just not memorable as we remembered eating in Flo's in the past. 

We were saddened to see the direction Flo's has taken. There is no je ne sais quoi anymore. So our return factor is pretty low, though we might give them another try at some point. 

Our lunch bill came in at $30.50 and our server Irene, was very good and kept our water glasses filled. So two and a half stars and barely "A-Okay". Now, where have you taken Flo?

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. 

Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.

 Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? 

Misc:
Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.
The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.
Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!
Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. 
Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. 

Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

This is my "Go To" spot for exchanging foreign currency.  Whenever I travel abroad I do some research on exchange rates in the country I'm visiting vs this joint.  9 times out of 10 they are very competitive with their rates and I'd rather exchange large sums of currency in Vegas than in a foreign country.

I was here the other day to convert some US Dollars to Chinese RMB in preparation for an upcoming trip to China.  I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.  They were offering 6.53 RMB to 1 USD.  Luckily, I had a classmate in Beijing that just exchanged some currency the day before and she said the exchange rate at banks in Beijing was 6.45-6.75 RMB to 1 USD.  Not a bad deal!  I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.

One of the bad things about this place is the parking.  If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.  That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.  

Which leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.  There is a large counter in the office where you conduct your transactions and a large window facing the street where people can look inside and see what you're doing. (see pics)  Not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.  I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.

Overall Value - they offer great exchange rates, I'm always satisfied with the value they offer.

Will I return?  Unless a better option presents itself, there's no doubt I'll be back!

Lions and cougars and manthers! Oh my! Yep. I might as well have been on a safari....the cougars we're thick as thieves. We were here for an event and this joint was jumpin'! Thankfully, it must hold 10,000 people...it is enormous. Lots of different rooms, patios and lounges for the cougars to make their attack. I had VIP service so I can't complain about that. The food was a buffet and was actually quite good. Of course I could have eaten a dish rag and been happy as I needed something to soak up the free Patron. Yep. Free Patron. The crowd was typical for this neck of Scottsdale. Hello stereotype! Could you be any more accurate. I had fun mingling, people watching and leaving. Yep. Leaving. We made a quick escape after I was called a fag in the bathroom by some gelled up, steroided out cardboard head dude. Sorry, just cuz I tried to share a urinal with him. Jeez! What's up with that. Some people are so territorial! I'd go here again, for an event, but never, never for a night out. Adios Barcelona!

4.5 stars

Mind-blowing.  Ultra-sensory.  Uplifting.  Captivating. Trippy.  Beautiful.  Colorful.  Heartwarming.  Ornate.  Awe-inspiring.  Psychedelic.  Cute.  Creative.  Emotional.  High-tech.  Reminiscent.  Sexy.  Masterful.  Expensive.  Worthwhile.

Not enough words can express how amazing this show is.  Beatles fan or not, this show will make you a fan.  You leave the show feeling extremely happy and like you're walking on air.  I have never seen so many smiling faces coming out of a theater.  But then again, maybe people were happy because they were high, because this show would be a magic mushroom eater's wet dream.  My only complaint is that there were not enough acrobatic stunts, which you'll find in shows like Mystere and O.  But Love is definitely a very large and very well-executed theatrical production that is not to be missed.    

The theater for Love is smaller than most other Cirque du Soleil productions, so there really is no bad seat in the house.  But I'd advise not to sit in the very front (you don't want to be at eye level with the stage) and not in the balcony seats (you want to be close enough to see the littlest of the many little details).  Anywhere in between is a great seat.  We paid $142.50 each for tickets in Section 208, Row S.

A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw
We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q

**breakfast review**

I had absolutely no expectations at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grll, I don't follow his TV persona or his shows. All I know is that he grills and invades peoples' restaurants for a challenge, how freakin' humble..
But I could honestly say this is one of the best breakfast (or actually brunch) places I've had in a very long time!

I started off my brunch with a Spicy Bloody Mary, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=g_DhgA5vwnDyojJ5hAg00Q
Honestly not worth the $9, but I appreciated the unique olive & chile pepper on the side, and the drink didn't taste like straight up tomato juice + vodka, there were a lot of spices in there! 
Warning, it was quite spicy for a morning drink. I thought "Hey~~~ Whatever, I'm in Vegas,"  but boy, did it kick my @ss that morning. 

Their impressive "bread basket" is breakfast alone! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Sy-fdjtW7Drd-6LBJ-i3ww

You must get the one and only soup Mesa Grill serves, the Grilled Corn Soup. Delicious and the consistency reminded me of soupier porridge, which made me feel warm and homey :*) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=0UI-AK7kH_DvUWgjOce34g

I admit I was regretful while ordering a salmon dish while Mesa is known for Tex Mex, but my Honey Glazed Salmon w/ black bean sauce was amazing. You can request the salmon medium or even medium rare!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Wz2EFRR4Kt-uZfR6WPjoPg

My girlfriends also ordered other breakfast staples like a Sweet Potato Hash (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=u4pq7PFOPYytWEhfxCxQ0w) and the Jalapeno scrambled eggs with Ham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=8YIzCO87s62KyKgqNedm5g). I can easily say these dishes were impressively satisfying breakfast dishes, and definitely exceeded my expectations.

BREAKFAST FOOD SUCCESS!

Plenty of options, it's a gem
Fresh are the off'rings at this buffet

Desserts great selection but just so-so
Creamed spinach so good, just for that it's worth a go-oh!

Show your California Drivers License when you pay
They'll take $5 off of your buffet! (until July 31)
That's around $20 on a weekday
Hotel is so nice, next time here want to stay!
Stu-Stu-Studio! oh oh oh

For the price, it's the best buffet in Vegas!

Recognize the chef?  Bravo's Top Chef contestant, consulted for XXX, worked at world class YYY, Michelin Chef ZZZ says he's "the greatest thing since boiled chicken".  Celebrity chef or otherwise, food must speak for itself.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to "delicious but" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the "in season" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

We really like Stone & Vine and look for opportunities to come here.

The three of us were here for a birthday last Saturday and had a great time.  We made reservations for 6 pm and we were greeted and seated quickly.  Our server Marisa came by almost immediately with water glasses and to give us a brief description of the specials.

We each started with a glass of wine which ranged from $8.00 to $11.00. Since it was still during Happy Hour we were also able to order off the HH menu. One of the nice things about Stone and Vine's appetizer menu is mixing and match four different Bruschettas for $11.00 (see photo).  The Garlic knots for $5.00 are delicious and a must!

For dinner, I debated between the spicy Arrabbiata sauce and the Bolognese.  Marisa solved my dilemma by recommending the spicy Bolognese.  Wow, never thought of that!  It was $14.00, plus $6.00 for meatballs and sausages.  Our group also ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana with Ziti for $14.00 and a HH White Pizza for $5.00. Everything was yummy and very good.

Our bill ran us around $29 each, including wine, appetizers and taxes, but not gratuities. Stone and Vine is a very nice, upscale Italian bistro.

Enjoy!

When I first started buying BB I thought it was the greatest thing EVER!! 
I got tons of beautiful produce and I loved going early to help distribute the Baskets. 

Little by little my basket became more and more unusable. The quality went down hill. 
I would be getting the same things week after week, things that were next to rotten upon receiving, everything was sooo dirty and some things that I would just never use, like 6 onions and 6 bell peppers. 

I recently switched to all organic and I thought I would order one of the organic baskets this week for a change. 

I've got to tell you I feel robbed. Honestly this basket sucks! Most of the items weren't even labeled as organic and I wasn't able to volunteer this morning so I don't know for sure if they even are. 

I don't know about you but I don't need 3 bundles of celery. Again the filth that these veggies are covered in is inexcusable. 

I spent $18 last week at the OTFM and got so much more CLEAN organic produce. BB charges $25 for their organic basket of junk. 

I will not be ordering these again. You really could do better at the grocery store or farmers market if you want produce and then you can choose to buy locally or U.S. grown veggies.

Cali cuisine in Nevada.  Why not.  Balanced, fresh, with the appearance of being healthy.  Ladies that lunch, not burgers and beer.

Note:  This review is based on multiple lunch and dinner visits (breakfast in Vegas, isn't that called lunch?)  

Food, if it sounds Californian, it's good.  Skip steaks, skip chops, pass on burgers.  Simples.

Standout starters include a toothsome grilled octopus atop a bed of fried potatoes topped by an earthy, nutty, peppery romesco sauce.  Excellent balance playing off the bitterness of the octopus.  The Tuna tartare, vibrant and refreshing.  Ginger, cilantro, soy and lime give it a great aroma and acidic zing, creamy avocado for richness and toasted quinoa to add welcome texture.

"My Wife's Favorite Salad" an excellent interpretation of the classic arugula salad with duck confit topped with earthy pine nuts, tart cherries, and a light poached egg.  Duck fat and egg yolk; the perfect dressing.

For mains, the caramelized scallops are excellent.  Perfectly cooked, no little golf balls here.  The puree of cauliflower with vanilla and truffle sauce work so well to enhance the sweetness and oceanic flavor of the scallop while cloaking the dish in an earthy perfume.  My only complaint is how UGLY the presentation; a splat of pure, scallops tossed in, sauce dumped on the plate.  "Mary's free ranged brick oven chicken" over a kale and Anaheim pepper mac and cheese, very good.  Simple, well cooked chicken, moist and flavorful.  The mac and cheese rich with a good backbone of bitterness from the kale.  Complex.  Perfect foil.

If there is any weakness, it's the pizzas.  They are correct but uninspired.

Comfortable space with a homey feel.  Friendly off Strip service.  Even better off Strip prices.  Family friendly.  

Listen.  Not a single sound of a casino.  Ahhh.

Dear Calvin Harris,

I had an AMAZING time at Hakkasan this past weekend, especially when you were on the decks, but many of my friends did not because their cell phones and wallets were stolen right out of their purses while they were on the dance floor. Could you please speak to Hakkasan management and urge them to increase security or safety for their patrons so that cell phone theft rings don't attack good people just out trying to have a good time?  

I don't have an exact number but I spoke to at least 20 girls who were pick-pocketed this past Saturday night (6 of which were in my group of friends) and many lost such valuables as their cell phones and wallets (including their IDs), which means their Vegas hopes and dreams were pretty much sunk as soon as they were ROBBED under the watch of Hakkasan Management.

Anyways, I know this is a shot in the dark and you may never even read this, but in the off chance that you do PLEASE bring this to the attention of Hakkasan management so that this type of thing doesn't happen again. I just don't want these thieves running around Las Vegas ruining anyone's good time. 

Thanks for listening and keep making beautiful music...YOU ARE THE MAN!

Love,
Mike

Just like every restaurant, bar & bathroom housed in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, the Wicked Spoon Buffet is decorated so avant-garde, so posh that you forget your own name just looking at its chandeliers. 

I LOVE that food is pre-portioned in its own single-serve bowls & dishes. This eliminates my biggest fears about buffets: contamination from multiple hands touching ONE serving spoon & piling on portions I'll either waste (boooo!) or eat with reckless abandon (boooo x2!) Wicked Spoon keeps me in check! 

My favorite eats were: 
* crispy chicken with cabbage kim chee 
* fried chicken 
* shrimp & grits (I got two portions!)
* chocolate-covered strawberries 
* pulled pork tostada
* red wine cheddar cheese

Other grub that I probably wouldn't repeat:
* short ribs: too fatty
* maple glazed pork loin
* macarons: tasted like meringue w/ jam inside. Not chewy enough. 
* beignets w/ chocolate & raspberry sauces (cute presentation sitting in its own tiny deep fryer!) 
* mushroom risotto
* all their desserts: gorgeous to look at (see pic), but taste was not worth ALL them calories.

The guys loved the hot crab legs & carved meats. $35 per person for dinner (no matter what day of the week.) The wait to be seated that Thursday night was no more than 10 minutes. Probably the only buffet I look forward to eating at again!

If i could ever put a rating of no stars I would gladly do so for this establishment. I agree with Jared T. below, this place definitely gives his town a bad name. This pseudo-LA ish & wanna be establishment is just another copy of what they hope to be, bringing in celebrities, mr. jerkoff bouncer, that ain't gonna work. Their front door staff really needs to get their heads out of their asses. 

Even the vegas nightclubs rarely stoop down to their level, especially on a non-holiday & rainy weekend. They're still weeding people out. seriously? hahaha. Good luck with your short-run success mr. owner.

I'm actually not bitter, I just feel sad that such establishments in Scottsdale still haven't completely opened up to reality. I laugh at you. lol. I'm sure there are good folks in Scottsdale, but from what my friends have encountered it just seems to me that discrimination is still alive and thriving under a cloak of modernism. 

If you're not from this town, just beware of the front door staff that'll come greeting you with discrimination with open arms. Unless you're a promiscuous blonde girl. lol

I see why Amy Winehouse doesn't want to go back to Rehab - - 'cause I don't want to either.

That being said, I voluntarily chose to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel, and willingly signed up to attend the douchebag/dirtyskank party at Rehab last Sunday.  It reminded me of those Spring Break parties you see on MTV, where the girls are having tickle fights on platforms next to a big pool and vodka redbull drinks are served in plastic cups with big straws.

I freaked out a little when my pink sundress wouldn't fly and was forced to walk around in my string bikini...  BUT, nobody vomited at the sight of me, and since everyone was wasted, I suspect I looked pretty damn fine.  In fact, I think it's safe to say it doesn't matter what your body looks like, as long as your outfit and hair/makeup are well assembled.

Kudos to the lifeguard who jumped in and rescued me from the 12 foot deep end .  He couldn't see my head (it was underwater), but had noticed my Rehab Souvenir Drink Cup sticking out of the water (I paid $25 for that, I wasn't gonna let it drown with me).  He dragged me to the shallow end, where I wiped the mascara off my face and promptly headed back to the bar for a refill.

As hotel guests, we had our own entrance, which allowed for easy (and free) entry/re-entry - - and for convenient 6:30 pm scrambling to our room to pass out.   

Note: Watch out for photographers.  When I removed my bikini bottoms in my room, a sopping wet  "Spy on Las Vegas - view pictures here" business card fell out.   There go my political aspirations.

I had heard so much good stuff about Hash House A Go Go and couldn't wait to try here.  Unfortunately my first experience did not live up to the hype.  The service was great, but what I ordered was not.  I was really excited seeing everyone else in the place getting their big plates of food.  My mouth was actually salivating waiting to get my meal.  What I discovered is that I ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  My entre looked terrible compared to everything else I saw.  I had ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries, and it was one of the funkiest tasting sandwiches I have ever eaten.  It tasted like bad pot roast on toasted, buttered slices of bread.  It was so inedible that I could only stomach about half of it.  I was super hungry when I got here, but I lost my appetite eating the sandwich.  The fries were okay, and were mainly what I filled up on.

I heard the waiter tell someone that everything on the menu is good.  Not true!  The Reuben sucks!  Don't get it!  However, everything else looks good and I still want to give Hash House A Go Go another shot to see if it is really worthy of the hype.

I was glad to finally check this one off my bookmark list. I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place. It's right down the street and the pictures always looked so yummy. 
If it's your first time here, ordering can be a bit overwhelming. So many choices, options, do I sit down first? No. Stand in line and order at the counter. Pretty cool you get to watch them prepare your pie right as you order it. There's an array off toppings to choose from. Don't go crazy. I think they recommend no more than 3 toppings to ensure even cooking in their wood fired brick oven. They pop it in and 90 seconds later, Voil it's done. This is the type of pizza my inner fat kid would eat everyday. But I'll try to be good and limit myself. This won't be easy. :)

OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  

The inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  

I have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!

P-ay-stee, P-ah-stee, or P-aaaa-stee, however you say pasty- it is good stuff.  When I went here with a large group of work friends, we found many interesting ways to say "pasty" and after the beers started  flowing even more ha!  If you are very hungry this is the place to go!  A pasty is similar to a calzone or an empanada but with a thin-ish pastry dough as opposed to a bread/pizza dough around the outside.  You can fill it up with any kind of yumminess you would like and the menu is full of delicious options.  

The drink menu is decent with a good selection of beers and I am a fan of their house cocktails considering 3 out of 4 of them have gin :)

The service can be slow, but they are generally nice and informative.  The patio is great for groups with bench style seating and picnic tables.  Two historic homes make up the building and  inside there is a view of the kitchen and the staff usually waves hi, which is very pleasant and inviting!

Taco Bell, is well Taco Bell.

We have been coming here a few times each month whenever we go grocery shopping at nearby Fry's.  It's a cleans store with some very nice employees who rarely get the order wrong.  We also usually see and have gotten to know the franchise owner, he's always about checking on things.

But not a lot has changed since Glenn Bell first made that chicken wire contraption to invent the hard shell taco over sixty years ago.  Recently though, corporate owner Yum Brands has taken to upgrade the menu with offering from Chef Lorena Garcia's authentic Latin recipe premium items called Cantina Bell.  They have also rolled out this past summer a tie-in from Frito-Lays for a Doritos hard shell taco.  Both items are good and tasty.  

I have a unwritten rule that most fast food places can only aspire to Three Stars, or in Yelp-ese "A-OK" ratting.  Given the uniformity of fast food, it's hard to set them apart from another fast food place.  But, I like this franchise owner for his hustle and how he keeps on top of things and actually manages his chain of stores.  So Three and a Half Stars to him and this location!

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

Celebrating a friend's birthday, we're dressed in 80s gear to party it up at Polly Esther's on a Saturday night.  And the fab thing about this place, you can wear sneaks!  Nice!

With no line at all, I was skeptical thinking no one would be inside.  You pay by the window (try to get discount tickets or free passes if possible) and then you head down a few stairs.  First thing you see is the old Volkswagen and then the Brady Bunch squares.

Bathrooms are to the left with communal sinks for both men and women.  Quite a few stalls and there was hardly a line for them when I was in there.   

Walking down the spacious hallway, you'll find this huge space with four rooms celebrating the 70s, 80s, 90s, and current hits.  Each room  has its own bar with its own VIP sections roped off.  They do a pretty good job keeping the music confined to its own respective room.  So, if you get bored of one room, hop on over to another.  And there's barely a line at the bar too.  (If you're in the 80s room and you get The Matrix, it's a two shot drink.  They make it so big though that it feels like a four shot drink.  It only costs 8 bucks and it tastes like shit.  But it'll definitely put you over right quick.)  Other drinks are pretty damn expensive though.  

We mostly hung out in the 80s and current hits room.  They also had Skip Martin, the lead singer of Kool & the Gang, performing near the 80s section.  

Overall, Polly Esther's at The Stratosphere is a pretty cool place.  It's not uptight like some of the other clubs down the strip and it's kickback casual for people like me who hate dancing in heels.  Lines are non-existent for getting in, buying drinks, or using the restrooms.  So, that always scores a point with me.

I normally try not to write one and two star reviews. 

I know I may be alone on this one.  Mostly, I feel bad for the owner, or small business person. They have enough working against them, after investing a few hundred thousand on a franchise.  It's simply bad ju-ju, or Karma.

My friend and I came here yesterday for lunch.  It didn't seem all that busy (photo), maybe five or six patrons inside.  It was clean and well lit place.  We ordered the Italian Special (photo) and a Roast Beef.  The sandwiches were okay and the staff  friendly.  We also used a coupon for a few dollars off.  It ran us about $12.00

Can I just say.....

Expedia dot cooooooooooooooooooooom

Hell-to-the-yes! I'm totally and completely in love with Expedia. I am a walking advertisement for that website and the customer support there because of the trip I just took to Vegas. After scavenging the World Wide Web for deals to Vegas for a friend's birthday I came across a few killer packages through Expedia. I ultimately called to speak with an agent and told him what we would like to spend. In about 15 minutes he had us booked in a JR Suite at the Signature at MGM, a brand new hotel that consists of three towers, 2 of which are for hotel guests and 1 for residences. Our room was on the 29th floor with a view of the strip and the room was absolutely amazing. The hotel is just off of the strip, however it is connected by an underground walkway that spills out into the MGM pool and casino entrance, as well as the entrance to the monorail. The hotel was lovely, the JR suite had a kitchenette, huge bathroom with his and her sinks, jacuzzi tub, plush, comfortable king-size bed, a Starbucks in the lobby, and three pools to choose from. The main pool is located in Tower 2, along with the Delights Cafe and each tower has it's own lobby lounge. For the price (about $200 per night), and the gracious staff, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The only thing I would mention is that they do require a $350 pre paid incidentals fee upfront that can be used to charge back food/drink to your room. Any remaining balance is then credited to your account 5 - 7 days after your check out.

The most horrible service I have ever experienced for a hotel; I wouldn't expect such a fine establishment to have horrible service. I shall not recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a great time in Las Vegas to come to this hotel. 

The story, our room door would not open and so the following things happened over a 2 day period (we missed our shows [Money loss]) :
1. Replaced room card, this did not work - 30 minutes
2. Called maintenance, waited an hour outside for them to come, opened door - 1 hour
3. Called maintenance again, waited an hour outside for them to come - 1.5 hours
4. Talk to managers, they did not help very much - 1.5 Hours
5. maintenance came and did nothing but call someone else - 45 minutes
6. maintenance comes, the staff did not document anything and we waited longer - 45 minutes
7. maintenance door comes, replaces the entire door assembly. - 1 hour
8. Talked to front desk - 45 minutes

This had more to it but that was just the summery of what happened...

Just say no and go somewhere else.
That is all...

PS. I hate writing 1 star reviews but when its deserved, I rate them appropriately.

"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today."  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys.

"OK, OK, where we going?"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining.

"Oyster Bar.  Palace Station." is all he says.

"Cool".  Leaning towards my buds, "Did we really feed him fish sperm?"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.

Very Important:

1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait.
2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.

That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.

Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.

Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.

Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.

The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)

I'm usually stay far away from buffets, however I am very happy I decided to give this place a try.  My mom and I were both in the mood to try some place new and after driving around and checking out all of commerical center we decided a Indian food sounded pretty yummy.  After eating there, I decide this really is the only way to go out for Indian food with just 2 people because I always want to try just a little bit of everything.  At Namaste you can, and everything I tasted was fantastic!

This is the most welcoming and diverse religious group I've found in Las Vegas.  I use the term "religious" loosely because many, including myself would argue that Buddhism is more of a philosophy for life and well being.  Much of Buddhism does not fall under the general "religion" rules.  No prosthelytizing, no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a "heaven and hell" or all-knowing higher power.

The SGI-USA Buddhist Center focuses on a particular brand of Buddhism known as Soka-Gakkai, which is the most established and followed form of Buddhism in the United States.  I was told that the President of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the Las Vegas area was a crucial place to have a presence.

I went to the community center a few months back to check it all out.  Luckily I got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends.  You're likely to hear a lot of chanting, perhaps a video from an SGI presidential address in Japan, and lots of people talking about how Buddhism has improved their lives.  What struck me most is the diversity.  You'll find people from all ages, races, and walks of life.  No formal dress code.  Just come as you are.

There are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain SGI Buddhism  to newcomers.  Much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood, often hosted at a member's home.  I haven't been back much since I'm still exploring other forms of Buddhism.  But those who are interested will find this as an excellent starting point.

What can I say that has not been said already.

This place is a Foodie's version of Crack!

I was half way home when I wanted to turn around and go get me some more!

OMG! It was just so delicious!! 

Starting with the giant mason jar of the coldest Ice Tea I've ever had and it was perfectly brewed not too strong or bitter. I got the unsweetened.

I ordered a chicken breast with a waffle and a side of mac and cheese

Everything arrived steaming hot, even the syrup! I Love that!
My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball, The chicken was so crispy and flavorful, not too spicy or salty but just right, it wasn't even greasy.

My Husband got the same with a side of cheesy eggs, He was lickin' his fingers and bobbin' his head.....so what does that tell ya!

All in all it was the best we've ever had, We Will be Going back!

After the withdrawals wore I off I slipped into a complete food coma and slept the whole way home!

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). 

Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:

Rooms
 * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian
 * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft
 * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more

 * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury
 * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)
 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

Dining
 * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting

 * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations
 * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas
 * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation
 * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out

Shopping
 * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal
 * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat)
 * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end
 * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights

Parking & Location
 * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo
 * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island
 * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage

 * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking

The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.

This place is redefining fast food. With good ingredients and short cooking times comes delicious pizza. It may be a notch below places like Due Forni or Dom DeMarco's, but for what it is, it's amazing. It's inexpensive (only one size of pizza for $8.95), quality food... think of it as Due Forni (or Dom's) Light.

For the price you can get as many toppings as you want. I took it easy and just got the pesto sauce with chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. After only waiting a few minutes it was brought out to our table. The crust had a decent char around the top and outside edges and the bottom was even crispier, making it easy to pick up a slice without it going limp and having the toppings slide off.

Other reviews have said they cut the pies into four slices, but they cut ours into eight. It's nice to see new business listen to feedback and make tweaks for the better.

Custom Built Pizza is also great for kid's since they can choose their own toppings and see it being assembled. Plus, it's affordable.

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

Yes - Gabi K is reviewing a smoke shop on Yelp... 

Why? You ask?  Because I went in late Sunday night after the OYE and after our stop at Mojo, so Jared M could show me his old stomping grounds.  I guess he worked at this Trails back in the day.

While I'm not in the market for a pipe, specialty cigarettes, incense, blunt wraps, sexy costumes, rock t-shirts, etc... I had fun looking around for a few minutes.  I did not purchase anything, and I have no intention of returning anytime soon to do so.  But I guess if anyone is looking for any of the products I mentioned above, Trails is worth a visit.  I learned that they have around 10 valley locations too... 

I am sure someone out there will find this review useful?!

Happy Trails to you!

A nice 
place 
to go 
somewhere 
else 

Charlotte- Douglas is one of my very favorite airports and a very pleasant place to stop over for a while between flights on the way to somewhere else. 

It's not only clean but sparkling and squeaky clean. Things actually shine and it looks like you could literally eat off the floor. Pretty amazing with all those people thumping, thomping and thudging though it. 

The inside of the the airport is actually fun to explore and walk around, with line of trees, some very cool rocking chairs and little airplanes hanging overhead. Lots of corners to hang out in and plenty of little restaurants and shops scattered about. Even a people mover and escalators to play on although the things move too slowly to really have fun on. 

Sure it's an airport and everyone is in a hurry, some people are grumpy and the typical airport chaos does happen, but overall the folks I have meet here were are friendly and very hospitable. A nice contrast to the abrupt hostility sometimes found in employees of other airports. I'm always happy to see that my flight has a stop over in Charlotte- Douglas because I know I can have fun and will have no trouble killing a few hours here while waiting for another flight. Maybe someday I'll actually get out of the airport and see the city.

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on January 5, 2014, however, my Newark Delta flight via Detroit was cancelled due to the weather. The earliest flight I could get to Vegas was two days later from JFK on January 7. My original hotel stay was at the Planet Hollywood, but, because my arrival was delayed I had to find an alternative hotel.

I found the Quad, which was the former Imperial Palace on the strip. I never stayed here but, as a Total Rewards member their last minute room pricing was the most reasonable so I reserved a room. Big mistake.

When I arrived I found the taxi had to drop me off at the rear of the hotel due to the hotel construction still going on. I noticed a lot of young people checking into the Quad I guess due to the low room cost. My check-in was smooth. As you can see from my room pics, my room was ok, which was fine. 

My only complaint about this hotel is the construction going on in and around the hotel. Some areas of the hotel are still well worn. The hotel location is fine between Harrah's and across the street from Ceasar's Palace.

See the pics of my TR1724 room, which I paid $136 for the first night and $169 for the second night in early January 2014.

I would probably not return here. I much prefer Planet Hollywood or any of the other strip hotels, which do cost a little more.

Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. 

The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. 

We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. 

But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. 

I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.

SushiSamba

SushiSamba is an Asian Fusion type of Restaurant.  It takes the combination of Japanese, Brizilian and Peruvian cuisine to create their menu.  After attending a show in the area we had the craving for some Sushi.  We had decided on Sushisamba.

When we got there I think we were in between meals (lunch / dinner) so the place was now crowded.  It was kind of good like that, because it wasn't too loud and plenty of tables to select from.  Kind of dark, but yet nice ambiance.  A little music in the background, not too loud which allows you to have a nice comfortable conversation.  Not too dark to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.  Here is what we decided to order:


Rock Shrimp Tempura 
Golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette 18.00
Tasty...think I like this dish the best.  4 stars

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=YfPESP5vVgqKCRts_w9uKQ

Sea Bass and Miso  
Sea Bass on a skewer
Tasty and flavorful, the sauce was on the sweet side.  But when your hungry your hungry.  4 stars

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=qyYOuNCdfMW8winJG3KKZQ

Yellowtail jalapeo and lemongrass 14.00
This dish...I really didn't get to taste but a piece of....but the Yellowtail seem to have been warmer than room temperature.  Normally they are served slightly below room temperature.  
Overall 3.5 stars.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=pld_gLNKWlhXqqZuMCerHw

Green Envy 
tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo 13.00
This dish was nicely prepared.  A good mixture of the Salmon and Tuna.
Overall 3.5 stars

Rainbow Dragon 
freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado 15.00
I've had better Rainbow Dragon Rolls....but it was good enough to pass the average taste level for me.  
Overall 3.5 stars

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=XH1kDM59gYRAqYPJ2lVnqQ

Our service was excellent.
Our drinks were good.
Suggestions and recommendation from our waiter was on point.
Will return when in Vegas.

On our receipt from yesterday's visit, we noticed: "Tell Us About Your Experience?" 

I blinked at the following question: 
"Please tell us why you were not Highly Satisfied? Be as specific as you would like?"

Here was my cut 'n paste response:

"Please know, there are many choices in the area for sandwiches.  Jimmy John's, Corleone's, Jersey Mikes, Vermont Sandwich, just to name a few; along with Al's Beef and Luke's of Chicago (next door).  We rec'd a text upsize message and decided to give you another try.  

"On our first visit, the meat (roast beef) on your Slaw Be Jo was dark brown.  On our second visit, there was garbage on the floor. I still have the pictures and your employees did nothing, when I told them about it.  It was in the Prep area btw. 

"Last night, we ordered two upsized sandwiches which were very good... Meatball & the Bobbie, along with one drink.  But, $18.26 seems at least $4 too high and that is taking into account a larger sandwich.  I really, really want to like your place, but I find it hard given the above."

Okay, here's a funny aside...  At the end of their questionnaire, they asked which social media do I use.  

The usual suspects were there, such as Facebook, Twitter, My Space (who uses My Space anymore?) and Fick'er, but no Yelp.  

I had to write Yelp as "other". D'oh!!

I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise. I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance! 

We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by. 

I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. 

The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty. 

The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing. 

The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them. 

Overall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!

We came here last evening to listen to that great voice which is Mandy Patinkin. Wow it was even better than we could have imagined.

His vocal range is incredible. He started with some old old Broadway tunes from the 40s and 50s. Then moves on and starts softly speaking these words without music:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

So you say to yourself. No!  He's not going to sing it. And, he doesn't. He just leads into the middle of another old Broadway tune. So you think, what was that?  Well, it was a tease. 

He starts having a dialogue with the audience about his marriage and wife.  But then comes back to it. Now accompanied by Paul Ford on the piano. He sings the entire song. Bohemian Rhapsody. All the parts. Wow! Freddie Mercury would have been proud!

That's how the evening went. Interspacing old show tunes with some more recent melodies.  He sang a few from Steven Sondheim's "Sundays in the Park with George".  It was a show he was nominated for a Tony.  The best of the night, was his singing of Oh Shenandoah. What made it special was his stopping midway to recite the first part of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. He goes back to Oh Shenandoah, then finishes the second half of Gettysburg Address and the last verse of Oh Shenandoah. Absolutely beautiful.

Surprisingly no tunes from Evita. A show he won the Tony for his role of Che, and made famous with Patti Lepone.  He finished the evening with a tune from the movie Ragtime and the music of Randy Newman. 

There were two curtain calls. He and his pianist Paul Ford looked exhausted after a non-stop ninety minutes. We left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. This was our first time to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and we were very impressed.

"'Doctors?' said Ron, looking startled. 'Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?'"  Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

After a dramatic year of treatment at a different and shitacular place for my Grave's Disease, I ran across Meagan B.'s review and found the amazing Dr. Amiri Harari. I ran away from my old specialist and never looked back... not even to obtain my records [more like they're holding it ransom for some dumb reason and won't fax them over]! 

This guy is a peach. From Day 1, everything went amazing. Even without my medical records, we got my bloodwork done on-site and we did an ultrasound before I even left [something the old doc never even suggested that I do]. I feel completely at ease with him. I get anxiety whenever I go in for anything medical but Dr. Harari makes me feel relaxed. 

Since I was already feeling crappy and frustrated about a year of taking Methimazole and not being able to find the right dosage, Dr. Harari answered all my questions and concerns in regards to radio-iodine. I took a few weeks to think things through. I asked his assistant and even Dr. Harari himself a million questions by phone and never once did he make me feel like I was wasting his time. I felt confident in going through with the radio-iodine treatment under his care. While the desired results aren't kicking in yet, Dr. Harari and I decided that I'll get bloodwork done every month for a few months to see if the hormone count will go down so I can become hypothyroid. I appreciated how thorough we got in regards to my situation and his opinion was really appreciated. Fingers crossed that I don't need a second treatment because I don't think I'd go through it again!

Dr. Harari is a brilliant specialist, knowledgeable, and patient. Like Meagan B., I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes past my appointment time to see him. I have nothing but praises for the guy!

I was warned by my friends not to come here :( But I ignored their advice and I woefully regret it... Le Village Buffet is THEE spot that my cousins and I would bust a mission to go to when I was little. I have so many good memories of this place and I really wanted to come back here to revisit those pleasant memories... Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past. 

I came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating... 

BUT THE FOOD!!!!! 

Bleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away. 

I liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was "okay" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary... 

This experience does not even come close to how AMAZING I remember Le Village Buffet to be... Definitely not worth stuffing my face for :(

I like this place for a once in awhile go to for homemade matzah ball soup! You can get it without noodles and just enjoy the goodness of soup. Probably best in town. They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)
The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!

Today was my first time here.  Yes, I know, I am a Big AL(big-ass loser.  You'd know this if you've ever taught middle/high school).  Anyway, I was meeting up with Tony, aka Lightrailblog for a late lunch.  I knew I wanted the elote.  I've been hearing everyone scream about the damn elote for months.  I started out with an iced tea (I am an iced tea FREAK!) that was flavored - I think mango.  Then I got an Arnold Palmer.  This was the BEST AP I've EVER had!  (Sorry, FEZ!)  It was made with freshly-squeezed lemonade and was plenty tart.  I also had huevos ranchers.  I like that they asked how I wanted my eggs cooked.  I HATE fully-cooked yolks.  Unless it's a hard-boiled egg, then it kinda has to be that way.  Came with a side of refried beans.  The salsa on top was awesome and not store-bought.  
Server, Steven ("Esteban") was awesome...as soon as he figured out that everything I said was a joke. I mean, come on, am I *really* gonna put my ice cubes on your nipples?  Well, not in public, and not until you buy me dinner.  HA!
Downfall:  THE FLIES!!!!  There were at least 4 flying around our table.  *shudder*

Come on, it's chocolate. Everybody loves chocolate. Errrrrrbody. 

So, why no love for Ethel M Chocolate Factory? On the drive there, you're excited like a little Violet Beauregarde and the suspense is terrible... you hope it'll last. It doesn't ... cause this chocolate factory is hardly worth the drive nor the most wonderful place in the whole world! 

It's a short self-paced walk through a hallway with a view of a factory without any oompa loompas or rivers of chocolate. It's some people running machines. We went in the afternoon and there was one person cleaning a machine. The "tour" is guiding you to a gift store with overpriced yet average chocolates. 

If my local supermarket or Costco sells Hersheys, Ghiradelli, Lindt, Cadbury, Ferrero Rocher, Guylian, Godiva, or even generic chocolate then do I really need to go here?

The small Cactus Garden is cool for a couple minutes. Of course, you just drove past a lot of cacti to see it. Of all the sites and attractions in and around Las Vegas, is this really how you want to spend your time? If so, pack up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster and head over.

The most impressive thing about the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden are the tour buses and cars in the parking lot. They prove that everybody loves chocolate. Ethel doesn't need to be like Willy Wonka and promise a free lifetime supply ... because a small free sample seems to be doing a sweet job.

I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!

Located next to Heart Attack Grill and in front of Toy Shack - a bar in front of a toy store? Why not?

My friend and I came here on a week night so the place was quiet. We were greeted by a sweet gentleman at the door who told us how this place works. You go to the bar and order what you want then, you can sit at the bar or get a table. Our bartender/server was Alexis and she told us about our drink options. You can get beer by the pint, do a flight of 5 beers and popcorn for $10 or the tasting tray with all of their 8 beers for $12. The tasting tray made the most sense to me so my friend and I got 2 trays. Instead of rating each one, I've ranked them 1 being my favorite and 8 as my least favorite.

Sandia:
Watermelon wit. Pilsner, wheat malt and white malt. This was fruity and I would get a pint of this next time. Rank: 1

Session:
Blonde. Pilsner, caramel. This was the tamest out of the group. This blonde did not have the most fun. Rank: 8

El Heffe:
Jalapeno hefeweizen. Pilsner, white wheat, pale malt, cara pils. This was awesome. I love hefeweizen and the kick from jalapeno is ridiculously good. Something you must savor. Rank: 2

Perfect Ten:
American pale ale. 2-row victory honey malt, C60, rye cara pils. Rank: 5

Hoppy Ending:
IPA. Rank 6

Hops Anonymous:
IPA. 2-row cara pils honey malt, caramel malt. Rank: 7

Downtown Brown (DTB):
Brown ale. Chocolate pale 2-row, C60, C120. I normally wouldn't finish chocolate stout/ pale but after this tasting, I have a better appreciation of delicious chocolate beer. Rank: 3

Simply Stout:
Stout. Black barley, caramel malt, honey, pale. Tastes like coffee. Rank: 4

They have 2 flatscreen TV's that are both on ESPN, yay! I'm not a hug beer drinker but I love this place even if they don't serve food. They only have Popped popcorn in cheddar, dill pickle, chocolate and buffalo ranch.

I don't always fancy a beer but when I do, I end up having a conversation about the gym, March Madness, chicken fingers and monster nipples. Which means we stayed there 'til closing.

Hands down the best buffet on the strip. We have eaten her so many times that it's become a tradition to visit every time we are in town. The ambiance is great with contemporary decor. The waiters and waitresses give top notch customer service. 

Great food selection no matter what you're in the mood for. They also get bonus points in my book for presentation. I love how they portion their food into little mini skillets and fry baskets, perfect so you don't overcommit to a single dish. They are reasonably priced for the vast selection of foods and desserts compared to other buffets in Vegas. And the icing on the cake, you can add $10 on top of the cost for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. 

Here is a breakdown of the cost and hours: 

Daily Brunch: Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. ($26.00)
Weekend Brunch: Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m. ($34.00)
Daily Dinner: Monday - Thursday, 5 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($38.00)
Weekend Dinner: Friday, 5 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Saturday, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($41.00)

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

Well in the end not all Filiberto's are alike. 

I came here for a late lunch, around two-thirty. The outside had a modern look, similar to the one on Indian Bend, near the 101 Loop. 

Once inside, I noticed the walls were bright and freshly painted (photo).  The seats however were dilapidated. Almost every single one was ripped, with exposed cushions and springs. One had a jagged piece of metal sticking in the air.

The food on the other hand was good standard Mexican fair. I had two huge bean burritos, which were filling and made on a flaky grilled tortilla.  They were only $5.28 before tax. 

There is nothing wrong with the food, or the employees. They were all very nice and friendly!  Too bad they have to work in such a dump. 

The owner needs to blowout the seating and take a little more interest in the store!  

I might be back, but only at the drive-thru window.  I should have gone to Los Betos across the street. Ugh!

Like "good things come in small packages", great sandwiches can come from small shops.  What the Vermont Sandwich Company lacks in dining area is more than made up by the size and flavor of those big beautiful sandwiches!

I met a friend for a late lunch - a nice break from the typical 'eat at my desk while doing three other things' type of days I usually have.  Since variety is the spice of life, we ordered two different sandwiches to split:
 
- Long Trail (delicious roast beef on sourdough with crumbled bacon, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, green pepper and a fantastic horseradish mayo)

- The Vermonter (maple glazed turkey & honey baked ham on wheat wtih sharp cheddar, lettuce, red onion, thinly sliced granny smith apples and cranberry mayo)

It was past the lunch rush, so our food was prepared pretty quickly.  When I first saw the sandwiches I thought "So how exactly am I supposed to eat these?"  They were big.  Very, very big.  With a little squishing/flattening I managed without making too huge of a messy disaster.  While I enjoyed them both, my favorite by far was the Long Trail.  VSC roasts their own beef, and it went so nicely with the horseradish mayo.  Delish!

Before we left, we were given a sample of a freshly-baked peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie.  Mmmm...

If you have the Phoenix edition of the Entertainment Book, VSC has a coupon - buy one menu item and get one free, up to $8.  That's a whole sandwich, people!  Enjoy!  :)

Heads up, Guy Fieri, while this place shares its very small parking lot with a Shell station, it is no "gas station food"! 

I just had lunch with Sam. Literally. When I asked where he got his delicious dolmas (grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs) and he said his wife makes them, the skepticism was on my face. They were perfectly formed and the flavor was intense. He backed it up by showing me his personal lunch from home and sharing it with me to the detriment of the fries in my combo which I was unable to finish after gorging on meat-filled dolmas, stuffed cabbage and squash (none of which are on the menu). And, for the record, his wife's cabbage rolls are AMAZING and should be added, at least , as a special! 

So, while dining with Sam he explained that he hails from Chicago where he owned and operated a similar establishment and has come to the Valley to join his sisters, one of which owns King Gyros (http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-gyros-phoenix#hrid:66ywkbFKsg_1IA03dK_JSg/src:search/query:king%20gyro) which boasts its own 4 star Yelp rating after 16 reviews. 

Besides the dolmas ($3.95 for 6) and some of Sam's lunch from home, I enjoyed a falafel pita combo ($5.99). A lot of times falafel, similar to meatballs but made from ground chickpeas, is dry and demands the accompanying tahini sauce and then tastes of nothing but sesame paste (blech!), but this falafel is moist and flavorful. Sam serves it with tzatziki sauce instead of tahini and since I can't stand tahini anyway, this is a bonus for me! 

I also tasted my friend's gyros which was ginormous! He ate half, if that, and was bringing the rest home -- the pita was overflowing with moist, well seasoned meat. 

I'm not a hot dog girl, as I've mentioned before, but Sam is very proud of his all beef Chicago dog ($1.99) which he cooks on the grill; still, an Italian sausage ($3.25) is more my speed. 

Without a doubt, I'll be back to Sam's!

P.S. The fries were hot and delicious and had a yummy seasoning sprinkled on them. :)

I wanted to try this when I was here last year, but I had to wait a year.  Like many similar spots throughout the different casinos this is a frozen drink and bottled beer stand that serves blended slush like drinks in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.  This one is located just outside of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino's Street of Dreams next to the Starbucks at the foot of the escalators leading visitors to the Aria/Crystals/Bellagio free tram.  The location is in a bad spot hidden from view from visitors exiting the Street of Dreams shops.  There is bar seating and small round tables nearby as the Monte Carlo website depicts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=HWH4uputadH926t3vAqz6A).

My friends walked over to Starbucks for some after-dinner coffee, but since I don't drink coffee I decided to have an alcoholic slushie instead.  Of the eight or so blended concoctions I went with the 16 ounce Blue Ice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=w-MIlrBEGwq3Sh1GUL7g9g) made with SKYY Citron Vodka partly because I'm attracted to blue colored drinks like blue Gatorade, blue PowerAde, Blue Raspberry Slurpees from 7-11 or blue cream soda.  The vodka taste stood out quite well and with the exception of a few spells of brain freeze I enjoyed the drink very much.

The flavor was neither too sweet nor too tart.  It was a very good smurfy blue after-dinner refresher.  The $8 price for a 16 ounce serving was exactly the same as all the other similar frozen alcohol blender stands we saw at other casinos along the Strip.  Jello shots are also available but not every night.

Considering the location of Bally's on the strip, it's pretty decent for the price you pay. This hotel is located right in the smack middle of the strip and is a short walking distance to most hotels. Back during the partying-on-a-budget days, my girlfriends and I would walk from Bally's all the way to Wynn/Encore in our FM heels with our classy red solo cups in hand no problem .

This hotel needs a renovation though! Some of the rooms still haven't even been upgraded to a flat-screen TV and the furniture is outdated.

The casino floor is chill and I love playing Wheel of Fortune in the "high limit slots" section. Let the dyke security guard strike up a conversation with you and she'll give you drink tickets for the bar :)

Really gays? What has happened to us? We've become so serious. So mainstream. So. Oh dear. How do I say this...so, so heterosexual! GASP! 

Strollers. Parents. Pets. Lacoste shirts. Topsiders. Soccer moms. Soccer dads. And in my best Sarah Palin voice, "Joe 6 packs". Just normal folks don't ya know. You betcha. 

Where are the inappropriately dressed men in Speedos, glitter and nipple tassels? Dykes on bikes? Minors tripping on E? What has happened to our luster people? Have we become....um, boring? 

Well, I"m not sure. But the Rainbows Festival is darn fun. A small town feel, in a lovely urban setting, filled with the usual food vendors, t-shirts booths and local organizations hawking their wares and services. But overall, the genuine feeling of fun, love and celebration permeated this event. 

Lots of smiles, hugs and waves. And yes, lots of families of all types. And, really, that is what it's all about right. We noshed on turkey legs, tacos and swilled Bud and fruity vodka drinks. Ten bucks to park, but free to get in. How cute and small town is that? Well, not the parking maybe. But who doesn't love a free party? 

Rickie and I had a blast and at the end of our Rainbow, we found a bag full of condoms, lube and free minutes for a gay sex site. Ahhh, my people! Girls and gays just wanna have fun! See ya next year. And don't forget the nipple clamps!

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 34/100

Nice Tory location! Supposedly they're moving it to a different space at the Caesar Forum shops later on this year, but for now it's by Henri Bendel and the MAC Cosmetics store.

Came in here the other day just to browse. I wasn't planning on buying anything, but I always like to pop into any Tory Burch store I run into because she's my favorite designer :)

This location is kinda small. I've never seen a layout quite like this one, but there's very little room. Perhaps they're moving to take over a large space? I'm not sure.

The sales associates were very friendly and greeted me upon entry. I overheard another woman who had come in right after me. She had come from the Palazzo Tory Burch location and put a purse on hold at this location. The sales associates helped her quickly and efficiently and it seemed to be an easy transaction!

They had a great selection of Tory's shoes at this location. Unfortunately, you can't see them all laid out together because they have these weird column-like shelves where they store the shoes.

Other than that, everything at this location was great! Nothing bad about it :)

Last Sunday I slept in and missed the 9am yoga class that I was planning on going to at my gym.  Rather than skip yoga completely, I jumped online and noticed that Sumit's new Biltmore location (in the Town & Country Plaza) had a 2pm class taught by Beri (one of my fave yoga teachers), so I planned my day accordingly.  I really needed a sweat after spending the entire previous week eating and drinking my way through San Fran.

I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the studio was... and the bathroom had a nice shower too although I opted to go home to shower after class.  The class itself was the same format I've taken at other Sumit locations... a combo of flowing poses with some music in a very HOT room.  I look at Sumit's yoga as a combination of a regular flow yoga class and a Bikram class.  It is pretty intense and it was so hot last Sunday that I had to sit out a few poses.  I left dripping wet but I felt amazing! 

Instead of paying $18 for a drop-in class, I chose to pay $2 more to take advantage of the $20 for two weeks of unlimited yoga.  Unfortunately, packages from other Sumit locations don't transfer.  Have I been back? Not yet but I still have another 8 days to take advantage of it!

REVIEW #400.

Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  

Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.

Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. 

The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.

Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consomm, sublime.

Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.

Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.

A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between 360 - 490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!

Nearly two years later, I returned to Tao.

A few[1] young women and I had no problems getting past security. I didn't receive nor witness any undesirable behavior from the bouncers[2]. A local friend of mine got us passes so the $20/girl cover was waived[3].

What an event! I had just as much fun as last time. Figured it was going to be a laid-back Saturday night (for Vegas, anyway), but I was wrong; it was bat-shit crazy inside[4]. A friend of mine from LA had a table, and generously shared drinks with us[5].

Table service was excellent. Server Joe (unsure of his name), offered to check on a member of our party who looked a tad inebriated, all-the-while keeping our waters refilled. Later that evening, server Tiffany approached me, pointing to a couple snogging in the corner of our booth (and doing a wonderful job of it, I might add). I assured our server that they were with us - the girl was, anyway.

Note for you shutterbugs: unless you're photographing for Tao in an official capacity, "professional cameras" (read: DSLRs) aren't permitted. Leave them in your hotel room - or bribe management for a press pass[6]?

Tao is still a fun venue to get your freak on, and if you have yellow fever, there's always a load of Asians there.

[1] More than two, less than ten.
[2] I thanked several for not being douches. They were appreciative.
[3] I got stuck with the standard $30/guy cover.
[4] Apparently P. Diddy was there causing a ruckus.
[5] I pregamed at the hotel, but keenly remember drinking lots of OJ. Thanks Binh!
[6] Do not actually do this.

I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. 

Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.

I have to interrupt my chain of wedding related reviews for this one... I've always been a huge supporter of animal rescue organizations, and while I rescued Minnie from a small rescue site seven years ago, I've supported the Humane Society through the years with monetary donations as much as possible.  But yesterday, I did something different...

I started my day (just like Melissa H) by rolling over to look into Minnie's eyes and be reminded how lucky I am to have an incredible dog that has become my family... After our morning walk and breakfast, I teamed up with a group of friends and we made the trek out to Dobbins Road and 19th Avenue to volunteer at the Humane Society.  I had no idea what to expect and I hadn't seen the reviews that came before mine, but I was extremely impressed at the size, cleanliness, and friendly staff at this fabulous facility.

During our three hours on-site, Kathy Chumley gave us a tour of the building,  told us about the history of society, and educated us on how they operate, the animals they care for, the staff they employ, the volunteers that help, etc... We saw the cutest dogs, cats, bunnies, and horses and we helped with feeding the horses, petting the cats and bunnies (I guess this helps socialize them), and putting leashes together too.

If and when I adopt another animal, the Humane Society is where I'll go to do it... and I highly suggest checking this place out if you're looking to add to your family as well.

I'm giving the Bobcats 3 stars because I don't love them, but yet I don't hate them.  Unless they are playing the Magic or the Heat...  I still don't hate them then...  I just don't want them to win.

I was able to see the Bobcats play the Magic in the playoffs back in 2010 in Orlando and it was such a fun and wonderful experience.  Luckily, my team (the Magic) won and we beat them by a pretty decent margin.  The final score that night was 92 - 77.

I did enjoy seeing the Bobcats play.  I love the NBA and I'm on a mission to be able to see every team play in person.  Hopefully I'll be able to accomplish that in my lifetime.  What was really super cool about this game is that Michael Jordan himself was there!  I was SO stoked about that!  I kept pointing and telling my husband throughout the entire game, "There's Michael Jordan!  There's Michael Jordan!"  I mean, I didn't get to meet him or anything as awesome as that, but we had great seats and I was able to see him the entire time.  I'm not sure if I did more basketball watching or Michael Jordan watching.  LOL

Even though I'm not a fan, the Bobcats are a good team and I'm still very happy I was able to see them play in person!   =)

Caramel is strictly a LOUNGE. Don't let their booming top 40's music let you think of it as anything else.

This is a nice place to relax and mingle for people in their late 20's and older. Other patrons need not bother coming by.

As sophisticated as this place may look, it does boom loud hip-hop and pop beats, but the dominant vibe in this place is "sit down, talk, and sip." 

These two mixed messages made for a night of being too young, too drunk, and being the only people on the "dancefloor." Boo.

If you're looking to have a nice chat and a couple of cocktails with a date or small group of friends, this place is lovely. If you want to have a more dynamic, dance-filled experience, do not go here.

Approximately three hours until the ripe old age of 27 hits me, after a long day of moving, we find ourselves in the Rogue. I am with the lovely Amber hoping to hell her plethora of visible tattoos will make it acceptable for me to be here by proxy. If not my cap proclaiming "I am the Boss" certainly did the trick.

Being a divier place I decided to be one of the guys and have a Bud Light like the good old days (I don't remember it being that gross before). The bartender tells me I have to put my shirt inside out if I am going to drink Bud Light. I look down and realize that I am wearing my Guinness shirt from the OYE at Finnegan's. Embarrassing but the guy gets cool points for the comment. Afterward I switch to a safe Jack and Coke...and another and another etc.

The jukebox kicks some major ass here. Plenty of punk rock, rockabilly, old soul that sort of thing. 

The Kevmo met up with us pulling into a front spot in his Subaru wagon and as he clicked the lock the beep drew some stares. Nice Grateful Dead shirt hippie. 

The band that was supposed to play never showed (probably syphillus complications?) so they had a replacement band show up about 11. 

Bomb Threat...yup that's the name of the band. They sound about like you would expect...screaming hard terrible wanna be punk rock.  

At 12:01 I decided that my first act as a 27 year old should probably be to throw some elbows in the mosh pit of a Bomb Threat show. I ended up covered in PBR as some guy who knew all the words to the songs decided to spray the shit all over the place. It was so ridiculously bad that it was fun.

In general I would advise avoiding bands playing here unless you have shitty taste in music, but otherwise this is a great spot.

P.S. I think I am going to create a Rogue Bingo game. Items to check off:
-Mohawk over 9 inches
-Tiger Army apparel
-Crimped hair
-Misspelled tattoo
-Person carrying more than three cans of PBR
-Cardigan sweater
-Tight girl pants on a guy
etc.

Umiya is my current go-to spot for AYCE. Its pretty, modern looking and well-decorated. High ceilings, good lighting, and a screen playing music videos of everything from Rihanna to Girls Generation. Everything you want in a sushi spot! *kidding*

I usually only order nigiri + appetizers. They have nice cuts of fish which so far, have always been fresh. Rice is solid. However, if you're a roll person, my friend ordered a few which were pretty delicious. Their appetizer menu is larger than most. I would say it's comparable to that of OYSHI. My favorites being the spicy garlic edamame and spicy tuna crispy rice. 

Service has always been up to par. The servers are generally friendly and attentive. It's never so crazy busy in there that you feel as though you're ignored and can't put an order in.

Note: Last call is at 1:30am. No AYCE after 1:00am, just a la carte. They also have a sushi chef which has a THUG LIFE tattoo. Because that is absolutely relevant.

I'm going to keep this one general and not too detailed; we all have to keep something private from the rest of the Yelp world, right?!

I will say that last night after the Ignite event and post Ignite event, Jared and I stopped by this Fascinations store... we were pleasantly greeted by the staff but since we were not looking for anything specific, they let us wander and be 'fascinated' by all of the sex toys, party favors, under garments, games, videos, and more... (they do have a decent selection!)

Not that I go into these types of stores often, but when I do, I like having the comfort of being with someone I am close to and/or not being harassed by the salespeople. (Yes, I'm shy, what can i say?!)  Luckily, I had both of these things during my visit last night.  We did make a few purchases, and I even tried to sneak in a package of 'nippies' since J was paying.  He caught it though, and decided to take those off of the bill (they were $14).  I thought they would be perfect for getting a nice tan line - I may have to return to make that purchase on my own!

If you're in the market for anything that you think Fascinations may carry (and believe me, if you think they do, they probably do), go pay them a visit!  Enjoy and remember to practice safe sex!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 36/100

Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.

LOCATION:
Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over

EXTERIOR:
Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street

INTERIOR:
Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning
Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling

SHOPS:
Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!

WHAT TO SEE:
Flowers in the entryway
Window shop in the expensive designer stores
Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!)
Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the "world's largest chocolate fountain"
The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day/time

I would love to stay at the Bellagio if I could afford it. I think I was expecting the Paris hotel to look more along the lines of Bellagio. Kinda disappointed over there...BUT Bellagio was simply beautiful!

I got roughed up and robbed by security/bouncers at the club this past Saturday when Above and Beyond came.  It all started with the bartender when I was closing out my tab and paying for the bill, I got into some argument with her about being overcharged for some drinks I wasn't supposed to be charged for.  The bartender then calls out her boyfriend who was some busboy worker and we start arguing back and forth.  Next thing I know there's a security guy with a flashlight pointing at the bill telling me to pay for it, so I'm like fine whatever I'll pay.  I end up paying (and even leave her tip) and the security starts escorting me out.  I thought he was going to take me straight out of the club but instead he brings me into some back hallway where only staff/security are allowed.  Next thing I realize is I'm getting my ass tackled down by security guards, lying face down on the floor flat, one guard is gripping my neck towards the floor, another guard is holding my legs down, and another guy with a sheriff-looking badge is handcuffing me.  When I look up I see at least 10 security guards surrounding me.  While still pinned down and handcuffed, couple of the guards go thru my pockets, find my wallet and take my cash.  I had over $200 cash in my wallet before we went to the club and the next morning I look in my wallet to find only $40.

After robbing me, two guards take me back to my suite while still handcuffed.  Oh yea, me and my friends got a suite at Cosmo; so I ended up getting roughed up like this while being a hotel guest.  Can it get any more mest up??

Watch out guys, if you get into trouble don't let the security escort you out alone, walk out with a friend at least.  Who knows what these assholes will do to girls if they take em into the back hallways.  I love EDM but I'm never going back to this $hithole.

Chocolate time!

This place is pretty awesome!  We swung by after brunch for an afternoon dessert & walked around the forum shops.  

To start, this really is a 5 star experience.  The amazing chocolates, the service, the atmosphere...  love it!

We ended up sharing a milk chocolate granita & it was so smooth & thick!  It was like an iced hot chocolate, actually, it is.  It was served in the "Drink Me" cup which was the perfect size to share.

The service was spot on & our server never rushed us even when we took forever to decide what to get.  We also found out from him that the chocolate pipes aren't real.  :(

I love the feel of the small caf, very cozy & intimate.  The have regular tables & some bar tables.  The decor was very chocolatey!  They even had 10-lb chocolate bricks for decorations!

We will definitely be back to try everything out!  Especially the fries with chili & cocoa dust!

Located inside the Forum Shops at Cesar's Palace.

Fat Heads makes some seriously fat/phat sandwiches.

I got a crazy good grease-wich when I came here in December. An artery clogger combination of egg, cheese, Linguia, thick bread, and other random elements of pure tastiness.

Each bite was worth the 10 dribbles of grease that would drip out onto my crumpled collection of napkins.

If you're in the area and looking for a fun rowdy place to watch a Steelers game with good food - def stop at Fat Heads. If you're looking for a "fill you up, can barely move once you're done" -  meal -  check out Fat Heads. If you're looking for a nice selection of unique beer brews - come to Fat Heads.  If you're looking for a casual place to catch up with friends - over a massive plate of nachos - go to Fat Heads  (though be prepared to wait awhile if it's game night.)

If you're looking for something light and some peace and quiet - - eh.....- you may want to head elsewhere.

Mama Gump had the right idea when she said, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." 

What would've been more helpful advice though, is what to do when your Fido EATS the box of chocolates. YES. I came home one night to find my dog curled up in bed after having YOLO'ed way too hard over an entire box. As in, more than one piece. 

So what's a concerned pet owner to do? 

1. Panic. 
2. Google "Fatality rates for dogs after eating chocolate." 
3. Call a friend. When he says this has never happened to his dog, panic more.
4. Consult Yelp for a 24-hour vet.
5. Drive like a maniac. 

I called ahead to see if I could get a ballpark on the service, but without seeing my canine, it was pretty up in the air. The vet was quick to explain the what they had done - induce vomiting, give him painkillers, etc., then walk me through what to expect during recovery, leaving me much more at ease. 

More than $100+ later, I learned my lesson that my pet sure loves instant gratification. I'm pretty sure he learned his too - THE MORNING AFTER SUCKS LIKE A MOFO.

The Ultimate Phoenix Downtown Destination!

On a day where it's 106 degrees in the shade, 30+ people standing in line can't be wrong. If there's this many people willing to risk 2nd degree burns from the scortching sun waiting in line for their turn to order up a hotdog, there really must be something to it. No where else in Phoenix will you find people this dedicated. I just couldn't help myself; I was drawn to get in line with everyone else.

Brimming with excitement from all the possibilities, the wait in line seems miniscule compared to the payout I am about to receive from such an amazing dog! Will I get a Mokie and add fried pickles? Will I order a Lady and top it off with green chilies and pinto beans? How about the Oliver and throw in some of that tasty coleslaw? Wait, no, I'll have the Bear, naked style. Maybe instead of the Bear, I'll get a corn dog, with some of that awesome chipotle cream cheese. The possibilities are endless - I guess I'll just have to keep coming back until I've had them all!

Oh no!! after getting closer to the front of the line, I found out they've even got a featured dog of the week with customized specialty toppings and this week it's Beef and Bean Chili topped with Fritos and Cheddar! What will I choose?!?!?

A quick visit to Food Truck Fridays in downtown Phoenix (McKinley and Central) between 11am and 1:30pm will prove there's Short Leash, and then there's everyone else. Don't make the mistake and get stuck ordering from "everywhere else."

Happy Yelping Phoenix and go grab one of these awesome dogs!

As the name suggests, this is not a place that screams nice sit down meal to impress a date located in a run down strip mall on Desert Inn Road, but your aforementioned date would be indubitably impressed if you brought their food over to her place and curled up to watch a nice romantic movie such as Thai-tanic or any within the Thai-light Saga if she happens to be a fan of Thai-lor Larb-ner (my apologies for the pad thai puns, alas it couldn't be helped).

While Archie's and Pin Kao are familiar Thai lunch staples to the Vegas locals, this hidden gem on the east side of town excels in value and authenticity.   To start off, you automatically knock off a few bucks simply by checking in on Yelp and receiving a complementary Thai iced tea, an always refreshingly cool, creamy, and sweet beverage to neutralize even the spiciest of meals.  One then has the options for the $5.95 lunch specials which include choice of main entree, soup of the day, steamed or fried rice, and veggie egg roll or chicken pot sticker.   The standout option is the green curry.  They are not shy on spice, so my advice would be to order at about 5-6 if you like spicy, and titrate upward with the dry chili flakes at your table since that is essentially what they add to increase the spice level.  My experience with 7 or higher is that the spice overpowers the other flavors and it is not a pleasant experience, especially if you are ordering noodles or fried rice since you can at least extinguish some heat from the curries with steamed rice.  

Whereas Pin Kao is heavy handed with the coconut milk and Archie's can be a tad on the oily side, the curries here are remarkably balanced and packed with vibrant and distinct flavors from the herbs and spices.  All the meats and vegetables components are fresh and well-cooked with toothsome textures.   A few items I've tried off the beaten path include the spicy crab noodle (think vinegary pad thai with bits of spicy crab), thai bbq chicken served with a side of papaya salad and sticky rice (aptly named "the three buddies", there's probably a food porn joke somewhere in here involving the words threesome and sticky, but I will keep this review PG), and the crispy fried pork (good flavors but way too salty).  The noodle soups are unmemorable and the one dish to avoid at all costs is the mee krob.  I've been wanting to try a solid rendition of mee krob (roughly translates to "crispy noodles") which is akin to hong kong style pan-fried noodles topped with a meat/vegetable starchy gravy but having a sweet acidic component and using rice noodles instead of egg noodles, yet the rendition here uses cheap chow mein noodles and drowned with a msg-laden sauce that reminds me of a premium bowl of cup-o-ramen.  I'm going to pretend this dish never happened.  Based on other yelper's photos, the whole fried tilapia topped with a spicy mango relish and the mango sticky rice look pretty legit so they are on the agenda for future visits.  All in all, a solid local mom/pop Thai joint that is easy on the wallet, loaded with authentic flavors,  and hits the spot if you are looking for a quick bite or as a solid take out option on the east side of town.

First thing you should know is you are "not suppose" to drink on this LED lit bar on wheels. It is "suppose" to only transport you from bar to bar to get your drink on. Here are my tips to make this experience all you ever dreamed of.....

*Pick only your coolest friends who know how to party. This is key to the whole equation equaling awesome.

*Load your ipod with all of your favorite gangsta rap and the Killers or whatever gets you in the mood to fuckin' rage. This crazy apparatus does not have tunes of it's own. All good, just come prepared.

*Adjust your damn seat. You may be too faded to hear the dude running the show point this out. If you are part hobbit like myself you have to lower that seat or you may not be able to sit like a normal human being for days and it will royally suck balls.

*Master the art of fake peddling. News flash: YOU DON'T HAVE TO PEDDLE IN REAL LIFE TO MAKE THIS BIKE MOVE. IT'S A MAGIC BAR BIKE YOU CAN'T DRINK ON. Pretending is always more fun. What's even more fun is if you look around at your friends really peddling like this is a high intensity spin class. Just smile and wave and do your fake peddling. It's Friday night and this is not the Tour De Vegas. It's like a booze cruise on the city streets.

*Tell the man in charge where you want to go. Otherwise he will take you to lame places like the Nacho Daddy or other lame tourist traps. Create your own destiny guys.

*Bring a "coffee thermos or something" filled with a tasty beverage that you can disguise as water or coffee or hot chocolate. That's all I have to say about that. If you can't decode that message than maybe you should just be home playing Candy Crush or something. 

That's all I got. Overall this is an amazing experience with the right group of people and the right music and right level of intoxication. Not 5 stars for me because the owner should A. Have his own music program. B. Negotiate drink deals with the local bars he drags you to. C. I wish it lasted longer. 

Enjoy the ride......

These ladies are pressing up the most delectable dietary delights in Las Vegas! It's a five star experience all the way to organic nirvana.

HPP means high pressure pressing. All USDA organic, non GMO. A lot of their produce is sourced from California, which means a smaller carbon footprint. Their bottling is either glass (all class) or plastic, and the plastic bottles are, of course, BPA free. What's not to love?

If that's not enough to entice you, the radiant ladies they have behind the counter (or the adorable Queen Bees that are wandering the floor this afternoon) are incredibly friendly AND knowledgable. Their concept goes beyond trendy. When they began to tell me about how certain vitamins will be absorbed 100% because of the pairings with other vegetables, and a mention of trace minerals (87 in BeWhealthy, if you're counting), I knew I had come to the right place! It's a breath of fresh air having nutrition that makes sense and does work for you, instead of just adding chia seed to everything and calling it healthy.

Their selection of smoothies are limited to a mere four, but they run the gamut of every avenue of nutrition you need. Fruit based, protein based, veggie based, and fat based (think coconut, avocado). They have superfood add-ons as well such as chia, hemp, flax, coconut meat, bee pollen, spirulina, nutritional yeast.. The list goes on. I've tried all but the protein smoothie and can confidently say they are delicious and filling! I love my liquid lunches on the go.

The space itself is gorgeous and inspiring, the branding and bottling is sexy, the juices are not only good for you, but specifically crafted to be delicious while beneficial to your health. Bee well!

Never Again!

This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).

As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.

Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!

This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked to see how my pets were doing. I can't say enough about Amanda's Pet Sitting! Amanda followed my instructions perfectly and was always in touch with me and returned my phone calls right away. I've used her services for years now and I'm always happy with her service. I recommend Amanda to everyone I know that has pets.

Like the 80s group ABC sang "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"... But hurt in a good way (you know, like nice, naughty spanking) and not bad hurts like the sound of Lindsay Lohan's voice. Are we clear? I was an Urban Studies/Architecture major in college and I love this whole 50s style meets mid modern meets Scottsdale. From the lobby to the grounds to the pool to our charming, color splashed, glass brick adorned room, this was a major score in the Staycation category. I was initially intimidated by the pool crowd as I noticed NOBODY was actually IN the pool. Just posing around the pool. Were they looking at my pasty white Scandinavian skin? My extremely, freakishly small nipples? Or the Hello Kitty towel I brought from home? Hmmm..fBack to the room....the glass brick divided the room from the shower...and what a fabulous shower. Nice, big, pulsating head. Honestly, I'm not trying to go all pg13 on ya! Bed and bedding were cozy and spotless. A great place to crash after Rickie's headlining collection at Phoenix Fashion Week. The room was at one point spacious enough to accommodate Mr. Gonzales, the stylist, the assistant and anywhere from three to eight models. I was comfy on our fabulous bed with a glass of wine watching it all unravel in front me. Who needs TV? It was very entertaining. And when I needed to escape we had our own private patio. Wait? Wasn't that a B52s song? So Valley Ho...you are hip. But you're also great deal. A great venue. And yes, maybe even, OK, I"m getting a little vaklempt, a great friend....

Throw out everything you've known about frozen desserts because this will blow your mind. Ice cream...no. Frozen Yogurt...no way. Snow Cones...not even close.
Frost Bites Shavery is the modern day dessert craze that will take over!
At first glance, the flavors are common enough...mango, strawberry, chocolate, coconut...but wait...BLACK SESAME?! Where did you come from?!
Let's start with the texture...fluffy sheets of creamy ice in mango or BLACK SESAME (yes will use all caps for that) flavor that are piled high in a cup size of your choice...do not get anything less than a regular size. The delicate flecks of toasted sesame throughout prep you for this encounter. Rich, full bodied creaminess that has warm nutty and vanilla hints wrapped up in these icey sheets that is a wonderful departure from your normal experience. The mucho mango is like biting into fresh mango and topped with ripe mango is a tropical fruitopia blast. Lastly, strawberry condensed milk? Oh yes, please!! Only 4 ingredients in each, fresh fruit and all natural. It won't fill you up like ice cream or froyo and much more waist-friendly choice, even if making multiple trips....ahem, you know who you are :)
The owners are all super friendly and this location has shade plus some seating and plenty of parking. The ordering is simplified into 3 steps that streamlines the process. They offer stamp cards & will even honor Kuma cards as well.
Stay tuned for more flavors and cool off at our new summer hot spot!

In my best Charlie Sheen, "Windsor. Winner. Windsor. Winner!"

I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.

Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would "double dip"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!

My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich. 

I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy. 

Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!

The Palazzo was everything we imagined it could be. We chose the Palazzo primarily for its location. 

The check in line was long upon arrival, but it moved in a steady pace and we were checked into our luxury suite rather quickly. All of the rooms here are suites, but we upgraded for a luxury suite to get a nice view. Our room was on the thirtieth floor overlooking the pool and the Strip. It wasn't much to look at during the day, but at night, it was breathtaking. 

The room was well appointed with a king size bed, full bathroom with quality toiletries. There were three TV's and a separate living area with sofa and loveseat. The sofa was a sleeper, we could've had two more people stay comfortably since the room was over seven hundred twenty square feet. 

The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian which was another plus. There is a Walgreens connected to the Palazzo on the bottom floor which made it extra convenient to get our bottled waters. 

We liked the fact that it's connected to the Venetian. With that in mind, the number of shops, restaurants, cafes, spas, and nightclubs are endless. I highly recommend the Palazzo if you want to take in as much as you can, on the Strip. 

Oh, and if you are environmentally conscious:
They recycle everything here!
The hotel runs on solar power, with thousands of solar powered panels on the roof tops, it's quite incredible! Everything is running off of the solar panels! 
There are employees who are in charge of separating all of the waste, from plastic, paper, and compost waste. 
Everything is recycled! 
Pretty cool!

I'm so grateful we have a new children's museum in Las Vegas. This one is definitely my favorite family friendly activity and a step up from the previous museum (Lied Children's Museum) in every way. First off, it's located in a much nicer part of town. They have their own free parking structure. No more parking your car in the triple digit heat near a questionable area. Much more square footage and many more exhibits that engage the minds of our next generation. It's on the pricey side so I'd highly recommend the annual pass. It's worth it. There's two lines when you enter, a members line and general admission. Not really sure why they separate the two since they both seem to move at a glacial pace. I think having more staff at the front would be very helpful. 
It's easy to lose a few hours here. There's so much to do and see. Smith's, Jamba Juice, a mechanic shop, bank, airport, veterinarian, puppet show, pirate ship, the traveling exhibits...my kids just love it here. Water world, young at art & toddler town are especially popular with my kiddos. I like that they kept some stuff from the previous museum. The tornado simulator & the demonstration "Cold Science" were always crowd pleasers. I just wish they would've made a larger picnic area or included a cafe. A few tables and a soda machine are not what I had expected.

The Bf & I invited a few friends and decided to check this place out. The place was a little hard to find, kind of hidden in the corner, but definitely worth the effort. 
Great, extensive beer list. I really liked the kronenbourg 1664  Blanc with 5% alcohol. I also liked the beer content being in the menu. Plus they have Titos vodka... Yay!! 

The spicy calamari was amazing. I only wish there was more of it because it was so good! The seaweed underneath complimented it perfectly. I also ordered one of the burgers, without a bun. Very flavorful. They were a little stingy on the fries, but since the bf kept stealing them I can't really complain too much. I think they were just so good that I wanted more of 'em. Yummy in my tummy! 

Service was excellent, bartender Kristyne is friendly and fun. I wish this place was closer to my house, but either way I'll definitely be back. It was a Friday night, and the place was pretty busy. Good quality of people.

Craft cocktails at the Linq!

Blvd. Cocktail Company is the latest pre-prohibition style offering from the folks behind Commonwealth, Park on Fremont, etc..  Blvd is at home in its touristy Linq setting and is probably the best option in this Linq area for quality, craft cocktails.  The bar is tended by a combination of stellar mixologists and adequate bartenders...be sure to order from the stellar mixologists (choose wisely, one of the best in town is here) if you are going off-menu in the craft direction though.

A hipster design firm vomited all over this space and as a result, the setting is hip and trendy with POF wallpaper and paintings, while a giant light bulb chandelier dominates the center of the room.  Live music is cranked out of far too many speakers at an exceedingly high volume entirely mitigating your ability to enjoy conversation...but the music does seems to be on point as far as quality goes.  There was a fantastic artist playing the Saturday night we came down and I heard great things about the previous weekend as well.

It is a challenge for me to rate Blvd.  I would give out 3 stars for the tourist trap setting of the Linq.  It would be 2 if based on the volume of music....Maybe as high as 4 stars if judging simply on  the interior and theme of the bar.  But an easy 5 stars for the drinks from Juyoung.  You can do the math, that's a 3.5 Star average...it could go either way, but I'm going with a weak 4 Stars.

We came here for a cup of coffee and decided to order some eggs and bacon. Clearly bacon is their strong suit and the coffee was really very good as well.

I decided to come back the next day and see if yesterday was a fluke. Since we generally liked our original visit over a year ago but at the time we found things somewhat uneven.

Well the good news to report is that since my first visit with fellow Yelp'ers and Pepper Head Mark, things have improved. Service can be a bit slow during busy periods, they have definitely improved. The sad sausage I had eighteen months ago has been retired. It's been replaced by a very flavorful one (see photos).

Today we ordered the French Toast and the Oink's French Toast. The latter is just over the top sweet and a bit too much for this gourmand. While the regular French Toast would be enjoyed by every Gourmet as being just right. Look that up in your Roget's. LOL

Expect to pay $15 each if you don't order a 4 piece (1/2 flight) or 8 piece (full flight) of their absolutely delicious thick flavored bacon. If you do, and I would recommend that you do, then expect to pay accordingly, around $22-$25.  But ohhh, but it's sooo worth it!

Enjoy!

My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

*examines my shirt*

Girl: What is "Yelp"?

Aw, shit. Now it's on...

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

You gotta feel it, It's electric!

I hope you're prepared to boogie woogie for almost an entire year, cause that's about how long you'll be waiting for a chance to slide into your own all electric Tesla. 

You gotta know it, it's electric. With up to a 300 mile all electric battery range, the Model S (and all Tesla's) are custom built to customer specifications; they begin delivering this years models in fall of 2012, but you've got to already be on the list to get yours. These baby's start at $57,000 (for model S) with a 160 mile range and can sport up to a 300 miles with an upgrade to the batteries ($77,000). You're in luck though, cause right now you can get a sleek $7,500 tax credit from the US Federal Government for buying electric!

But you know it's there, plug in everywhere. Model S comes standard with everything needed to plug in to any 240 or 120 volt outlet or public charging station. Charge yourself about 100 miles worth in 3 hours in a standard 110, or 100 miles in 1.5 hours from a 240 volt charging station. If you're worried about un-necessary charging and wasted electricity, the charge shuts off after the battery has reached capacity; I asked the Tesla rep!

I've got to move, come let me take you on a party ride. Racing from 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds with 0 emissions, Al Gore might just throw you a party for helping to save the planet. This beauty is sleekly styled with aerodynamic feel, and toutes a low center of gravity with their innovative floor mounted battery design achieving optimal weight distribution. Be the envy of all your friends (eventually) with a 17'' driver control touch screen, and connect up all your Bluetooth or USB devices.

Some say it's mystic, it's electric. Nothing mystic about it, this is American engineering and ingenuity at its finest! Man I wish I had one. Although, I'd have a tough time re-charging without an outlet nearby my parking spot. Maybe I could talk to the neighborhood HOA about that one.

Stop in to their storefront located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square on the second floor. Yelpers, it's time you learned the electric slide, but in Tesla style!

If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.

The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.

Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their "system" which I thought was a good thing.

Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

We enjoyed our brunch this Sunday. Arriving right in the middle of the rush, it was a surprisingly short wait. The tables turn over quickly here!

Even though they have tons of other stuff - sandwiches, waffles, salads - there are two pages of crepes on the menu - one of savories and one of sweets. Tough to choose!

After our waiter brought us two swimming pool sized cups of coffee, we chose one sweet crepe (the Apple Streusel) and one savory (the Crispy, which is cheese stuffed). Both took a little bit to be prepared, during which the coffee was refilled. Good coffee, btw. Even though they have lattes and cappuccinos and other 'elite' coffees, you can't go wrong with a cup of Joe here.

Both plates arrived looking excellent as you can see from the pictures. The apple crepe was massive and quite sweet. The "Crispy crepe" was excellent. Tons of cheese and lots of flavor. I think I made out better for having that one. Oh, and the side of potatoes? Heavenly!

Plenty of parking in the parking deck behind the restaurant or on the street if you can find it.

See the amazing family  attempt to eat vegan!! 
Watch the brave kids eat fake burgers!! 
Observe the care and balance of the waiter/server/host  who attempts to amuse the meat eating group as they  balance the high wire of going green! 

We had a fun and adventure trying out the local vegan place that we would love to love.. but it's just not  in our future. 

Fresh and bright inside , the decor screams: I am earthy , and healthy and well thought out .  I give it two thumbs up for the refreshing design. ( except that blasted TV with "SuperiorMaster"  TV channel from a Satellite Planet located somewhere near the moon of vegan. 
The place was empty at 4 , I hope they have more business later , they really need a better location and more informative signage. 

We gave a shot trying out Vegan burger with fries, they tasted okay from all accounts but not enjoyed. My husband had the only winner at the table "Cha Cha Chicken"  tasty and good texture. I would order it if you made me go back . My meal was the loser ..it had 5  fake shrimp and big huge bright green bean pods ..very snappish ..I felt well Beaned.  
 Youngest kiddo avoided the whole adventure with a bowl of 
rice ..wimp. 

We all decided if we were vegan we would like this place and be happy to come back .. but we are  steak loving, dairy drinkers with our eyes on the leftovers in the fridge when we came back. On to another adventure!

I have eaten here recently a couple times. One time the service was shitty and the other it was great. The food gets 5 stars easily. You get what you pay for here. 

Grandma's Meatballs: beef, veal, and pork. Good flavor and easily shared but you wont want to. 

Free Bread: dude came around once with bread and that was it. I wanted more bread! He poured some oil and vinegar for us (a lot of it) and gave us 1 piece of bread for it. That's ok I made up for it by eating all the bread stick thingys that are in the cups on the table. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board: damn yo this was real good. I didn't care for the olives but I'm not a fan of them anyway. The meats and cheeses I could have ate all day.

Orecchiette and Italian Sausage: This dish had sausage in its name so I ordered it. It was not as heavy as a spaghetti with sauce which was nice. I ate every bite and would order it again. 

Spaghetti Bolognese: I was very surprised to like this. When it came out I expected some sort of red sauce on it but that wasn't the case. My wife took a bite and really liked the taste too. Winner winner bolognese dinner!

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake: Came with salted caramel ice cream. This was hot and good and everyone should order it. 

Zeppole: I guess a spiced sugar is outside of these but I didn't taste anything but fried dough. I didn't like this.

70+ visits and Tender continues to deliver!!!

This is my goto spot to unwind in Vegas.  Why?

1.  Top notch service especially at the bar.  Bar staff is incredible.  Perfect if your dining alone.

2.  Simple food done right.

3.  Well chosen "special" ingredients (like their butter... ask them about how its sourced, and the game).

4.  Very reasonable prices. (Expect to pay less than $100 for a couple of drinks and dinner especially with all the discounts they give you just for walking into the Luxor).

As always, the rule with Tender is, if its different, order it, else keep it simple.

The charcuterie and deli meats (different) is outstanding.  It includes wild boar sausage, duck ham, and antelope pastrami with a selection of mustard.  Wow!  The salmon sampler (simple) is also well worth the try.  Both are large portions and can easily be a light meal if you pair it with a drink.

For mains, its all about the meat.  Take your pick of the cuts and different producers.  This is the short list:  American Kobe from Mishima Ranch, Durham Ranch Bison, Strauss Farm veal, and free-range Berkshire Heritage pork.  Any cut.  All incredible and take the classic flavors of each type of meat to the limit. You will notice this immediately.

Finally, if you're adventurous, have the wild game tasting or if they have it as a special order the elk chop.  I can't even describe how good these dishes are.

Skip the sides unless you are really hungry.

RECOMMENDED

I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S, and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek, horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio, sushi bar, bar area, and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.

We ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip. 

The Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll, and nigiri that included unagi, ika, sake, tai, maguro, white fish, and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots, and I thought the red snapper had already turned. 

I was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently, the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.

Service was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again.

Just like the classic Miley Cyrus song, this place gets stuck in your brain for all the wrong reasons. 

I came here because I literally needed 15 balloons blown-up for an event. I was helped after I stood at the counter for a bit and waited for the girl behind it to finish her text. I told her my situation and she obliged by taking my balloons, setting them off to the side, and getting another worker to both ring me out and inflate the balloons. Apparently the cellphone rules all things around her.

While "balloon girl" inflated my balloons, another customer walked up and needed to be rang out. The "cellphone girl" didn't move a muscle and asked "balloon girl" to stop and help them out... really?

When I asked "cellphone girl" if she could continue with my order, I was told she couldn't because at the moment she needed to get a package ready to ship before the post office closes. Umm...  It's 4:50pm, so unless you're the Flash, you will never make it to the post office. Ouch my brain. 

Party USA might have the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Never-mind the clueless worker who probably puts in 15 hours a week after high school, the I guess "manager" who is loudly placing a food order via her cellphone while walking through the store, but what really bothered me is the girl behind the counter. Can't you at least pretend like you give a shit about anything besides text messages or the latest update on Justin Bieber's FB page? 

Plus this location is extremely dirty. Boxes and trash all over the place. Definitely a tripping hazard nightmare. 

Sorry. I went a little George Carlin on this review, but I mean... Ugh. Seriously, avoid this place like the walls are releasing Ebola fumes.

Returned here for dinner since my hotel was nearby during the week. I was seated asap and my waiter took my drink order.

I went with the 10 oz tri tip, mac & cheese and sweet mash. The tri tip was amazing-super tender and the light BBQ sauce was heavenly tasting. As before, the mac & cheese was average but the sweet mash was definitely a hit.

BTW the red beans and rice dinner was discontinued but they still offer other southern Cajun entrees.

I came with a group of 12 girls, me being the only guy. The promoter said he could walk the girls in but I had to wait in line. So in a revival of chivalry, I said no prob I'd just wait in line by myself and the girls should go in first. Figured it'd be maybe 1 hour tops before I could join them. We got here at 9. It's 12:15 and I'm still in line, stuck at about 15 people from the front for the last hour. In the meantime, the girls are inside and say it's still pretty empty. There are maybe a few hundred pple behind me in line. Oh yeah, and it's $125 to get in.

You guys really need to manage your line better and at least provide updates to the folks waiting in line so we know what our status is. If I had known this was going to happen I would've gone somewhere else and we all could've come out ahead. Instead, you've created a customer who will not only never return, but will convince everybody else not to. Worth it?

FOOD POISONING

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.

PSYCHO

We were walking through casino from Paris to Bally's when we saw a giant bronze bear that was almost 7 feet tall. We decided to go in and check it out. An older gentleman approached us with a really cool mustache. I inquired how much is the bear. 

He looked at me and said, "4250!" 

I then said to my buddy, "He said 4250!" 

My buddy, Tony M said, "$42.50!" 

The guy then went ballistic!!! He looks at us and says, "I'm raising the price for you to $43,000!" We laughed thinking the guy was being funny with us. 

He then said, "If you don't have $43,000 in your wallet then get out of the store!" He then took his hand and slapped himself as hard as he could into his bald forehead. I realized that this guy must be crazy!

A second salesman came up to us to smooth things over but we were done. We weren't spending our hard earned money on a giant bronze bear. A couple of other customers walked out with us. We all talked about how crazy the sales guy was and wondered does anyone ever buy anything there?

We never made it past the giant bronze bear but I'm sure everything in here is overpriced for the high rollers or recent casino winners. We won't be coming back but we will always remember the day we survived the psycho bronze bear salesman. Welcome to Vegas!

I live in a development at the bottom of South Mountain and about twice a year the scorpions come off the mountain and in to my house to stay warm or cool. They have a mission to live in my home and sting/and or terrorize me and my dog.

Scorpions are my least favorite of all the anthropods.. Picture a scary creature that glows under a blacklight, has eight legs, crab like pinchers and a stinging tail.. I can't stand them. I sprayed last May and that lasted until this month. Then I saw 4 in one week. The deal breaker was when the dog alerted me to one crawling on the bedroom wall. I gave up and started calling around.

I called several companies (Orkin, Terminex, Rid ect) and found that they are all very expensive... they all wanted to lock me in to a one or two year contract and the cost was more than $400. My current economic situation being what it is, I only wanted a one time spray. It is much cheaper to have them come out when the scorpions show up, than to pay for year round treatment. And I have no other problems (knock on wood) no crickets, ants roaches, nothing.

I had used Stanley before and still had their card so I gave them a ring. They came out the next day and sprayed my house down like it was on fire, I mean they drenched it. Standard service right? So why 5 stars? The guy that came out was AWESOME. Then I remembered why I liked him so much the first time. Not only did he spray my house, but he took me out back and walked me around to show me where I had a termite tunnel, then her showed me my breakers where the termite company certification was so I could call them and have them come out and treat my house (FOR FREE). He was informative and friendly and very affordable. I would recommend Stanley to anyone. I haven't seen one of those evil scorpions since.

He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. "I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life."

"Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa." replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.

The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.

They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.

The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat.

"You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here." ther kid said, "but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa."

So it's nearly two years since my One Star "Avoid" review and we found ourselves at the local AT&T store nearby. It was after four on a Saturday afternoon and we decided to get something lite and to give Carrabba's another try.  

Here are some quick observations: 
In the kitchen, there is only one broiler for cooking. At Macaroni Grill, there are three. So even though we were here when it wasn't busy, the broiler was in constant use.  It makes you wonder how they would manage during a busy period. 

Second the decor is very late seventies, and clearly in the need of updating. Our server brought us a dish of oregano and EVOO for dipping, it was off the chart salty.  

We ordered the Chicken Parmiagna Ciabatta, with a side cucumber salad for $10.00.  Along with a Pizza, two toppings for $10.00 and a side Caesar salad for $2.50.  Both were good, though not memorable.   Our bill came to $24.51 before the $4.49 tip. 

Well, until next year then, maybe.

See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes! 

Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."

Here's my take on this place:
For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!

If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. 

The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.

Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!

Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!

If Fleur de Lys were a woman, she would be a triple threat.  

Yeah you know, one of those.  Looks, personality and brains.

Consider me impressed.  Truly beautiful dining experience.  As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with high ceilings and a beautiful decor.

Regardless of the fact that I came during restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu, that did not take away from the whole dining experience or the quality of the food. The menu consisted of the following:

Truffled Onion Soup or Braised Veal and Yukon Gold Ravioli

Seared Skirtsteak or Citrus Glazed Monkfish

Molten Chocolate Cake

It was kinda like going on a first date.  You get a little bit of everything, but not enough to scare you away.  Before you had to ask too many questions, the servers came and told you exactly what you were having, leaving some things to the imagination.  

The menu I had left me intrigued and wanting more.

Unlike finding that triple threat woman, Fleur de Lys is not difficult to find at all.  It's located inside the Mandalay Bay.  

I'd definitely come back ... 5 star dining experience!

I always enjoy coming to the Market Cafe.  The staff is always really friendly and I love how they have happy hour every day from 3-close.  HH includes $5 pitchers of beer and $5 cocktails.  

Last night was the first time I had dinner at the Cafe.  Normally when I come it is either for HH or for breakfast.  Well I had the Rachel sandwich that had coleslaw, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, house dressing, melted on sourdough. WOW, that sandwich was amazing.  I'm glad I finally had dinner here.  I definitely be coming back to try something different.  Also my favorite cocktail drink is the Lee Trevino and my favorite breakfast item is The Rooster Booster.  

If you have not been to the Phoenix Public Market Caf you are totally missing out.  So, when you are in the downtown area and wanting something to eat or drink.  You should totally come here.

My bridesmaids brought me to Strip Gun Club for a portion of my bachelorette party, and I was absolutely thrilled with the idea of shooting guns while all dolled up.  Once we arrived, it was behind a dingy hotel and a chapel, but the exterior of the actual building looked sleek, clean, and modern.  

We were greeted almost immediately by two cute girls behind the counter, and were checked in for our appointment soon after.  She confirmed our information, had us review their disclaimer, set us each up with a pair of "eyes" and "ears", offered us the option of using a pink gun, then we were whisked off into the room by Travis.

Travis was absolutely amazing at handling three psychotic, screeching women.  He thoroughly explained how to operate the two guns we used, one being a pistol and the other a rifle.  After a few minutes of anxiety and sweaty hands, Travis cracked a few jokes, and completely calmed our nerves (with the exception of one of my bridesmaids who was so nervous she cried).

The room was fairly small, holding four quadrants for each session.  It was nice for us first-timers, because there wouldn't be too many guns going off at the same time.

We started off with the pistol, then moved into the rifle.  Both guns used the same size bullet, so the rifle virtually had no kick, which made it entirely more fun to shoot; also, shooting the rifle was a lot more badass.  After shooting each gun, he let us have a small photo shoot with the guns.

Overall experience was incredible.  One hour felt like 10 minutes, and left me wanting more.  Great job, Travis and team!  We will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas!

A three star rating per Yelp means A-OK. I think that fits for this restaurant. I think all of the employees are polite AND helpful. They are always willing to help out the newbies coming into the shop. The sandwiches are okay, but nothing which will blow you away. The only exception would be the Beef and Cheddar, which is really good. I dig the two soda machines that they have so you're never waiting to fill up. They have those new machines where you use the touchscreens to pick your drink.

One source of aggravation for me as a customer is that businesses are always asking the customer to donate something. In this case, they ask the customer if they want to round up their purchases. I really just want to buy lunch and move on. Let me decide how I want to spend my Charity budget on my own terms.

This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a "Sour Cream and Onion" and "Jalapeno" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.

I've seen a few Michael Jackson tribute shows and have been mildly entertained by them and in some cases left my head shaking.  Michael Jackson ONE blows them all away!  After a few mediocre shows on the Strip (BeLIEve, Viva Elvis, Zarkana), this is Cirque du Soliel's comeback to brilliance.

Whether or not you're a fan of Michael Jackson, I'm pretty sure you'll be thoroughly entertained.  It's not like a pure Cirque du Soleil production like KA, Mystere, or O, but it's more in the realm of a tribute show like LOVE was for the Beatles, where the focus is mainly on the music, choreography, and vision inspired my Michael Jackson.

A few highlights of note:

- Make sure you make it to your seat before curtain call so you can get to see some of the pre-show activities.

-The music has been totally remastered in which the instrumentation sounds brand new and follows the dance routines very well.  Like the LOVE theater, the seats have front and rear speakers to totally immerse you into the show.

- The choreography is very well done!  You actually start cheering on the dancers when you see many of MJ's signature moves and routines.

- The stage is pretty awesome with wall-to-wall projections along with some 3D holograms. --  http://bit.ly/1oXQifY

I can go on and on about ONE, but I'd be giving away too much.  Right now, this IS my favorite Vegas CdS show.  It blew my mind!  And it also got me a little misty-eyed simply because this is probably the closest thing I'll ever get to a Michael Jackson live performance.  And like what other Vegas shows like Beatles LOVE and Elton John's Red Piano, it rekindled my interest in Michael Jackson's music and had me listening to his songs weeks later!  I would definitely see ONE again for sure!

***The chefs at Nine On Nine did a good job sourcing and cooking proteins (foie gras, squab); while I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations, there is definitely good food here even if it is a little expensive***

Nine On Nine is a fine dining spot located in Downtown Pittsburgh (not too far from PNC Park and apparently near some theaters in the city).  The restaurant has a small neighborhood restaurant or cafe feel with hardwood floors and an open (but cozy and not industrial) kitchen.

The restaurant's decor feels very warm and approachable, but the menu sounds quite ambitious.  Nine On Nine has a tasting menu as well as ingredients you don't often see like squab.

The bread was standard stuff.  There was a mix of focaccia, country bread and a decent and hearty fruit and nut bread.  The bread was sliced unevenly, but I did like the creamy whipped butter, which was topped with strong salt.

I started with the seared foie gras, which was a small portion.  The foie gras was garnished with spring onion marmalade, brioche, gelatin, and crispy meringue-like pieces.  There were a lot of sweet elements on the plate, but they went well with the foie gras, which had an expected salty flavor.

I thought the onion marmalade was very good--definitely sweet but still with an onion flavor.  I liked the brioche--great outside sear but still soft and moist.  The foie gras was good--buttery, creamy and flavorful.

For my entree, I went with the squab, which featured both the breast and the legs.  The squab was served with hominy, chorizo, zucchini, arugula, and lemon.  I thought the squab was very good.  The breast was moist, juicy and tender.  It was a little like duck breast but had a bouncier texture.  The legs were crispy and good.

I liked all the sides individually though it was not my favorite combination of flavors.  There was definitely a strong lemon flavor to the dish.

For dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta, which was garnished with compressed pineapple, kiwi, pink peppercorn brittle, and a kaffir lime sauce.  The panna cotta was good.  It did not have a strong coconut flavor, but I liked the creaminess and lightness of it.

The fruit was really good.  I liked the brightness, sweetness and tartness that the pineapple and kiwi provided.  The brittle was on the chewy side and did not have that crunch and snap you get with a lot of brittle (but I still liked it).  The brittle had a very strong pink peppercorn flavor.

The kaffir lime sauce did not add much to the plate.  It did not have a distinct flavor.  It did not have a bad flavor, but I was not a fan of the consistency, which was kind of like snot.

Service was good.  My server was pleasant, polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu.

Prices were high.  Entrees were in the high $20s and $30s, which made Nine On Nine feel more expensive than Pittsburgh's Salt of the Earth (which seems like a more impressive restaurant).

Nine On Nine is a good restaurant.  I thought they did a good job with the foie gras and the squab.  While I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations (especially with the squab), I liked a lot of what was served.  I definitely enjoyed Avenue B more and thought Salt of the Earth felt much more original, but Nine On Nine is still a decent option for an upscale dinner in Pittsburgh.

I am not sure what the parking situation is.  I think there are a few nearby paid lots.

Terrific happy hour!  I'm almost tempted to give this first visit a 5-star review, but something's holding me back... Perhaps it was bec. I found it so dark indoors; How many times do I have to yelp it-- I like to see what I'm eating!!  When I'm dining solo and I can't take great photo souvenirs of my experiences, well, I sometimes feel "what's the point?"  

I like this space.  Thinking back now, I wished I'd gone to the NYE bash held here.  Maybe next year...  Took Mom along w/ me, and I could tell she liked the old-style swankiness, too.  I must go back again, especially w/ such delicious fare and drinks and at such terrific prices, to boot!

We both liked our drinks-- mine was The Bramble, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A#zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A a short, yet sexy concoction made w/ Bombay gin, lemon juice, muddled and fresh blackberries!  Not overly sweet, and very potent.  I believe Mom had the Pomegranate Fizz, a tall, cool, and refreshing drink made of Smirnoff vodka, pomegranate juice, and sparkling wine.  Can you believe these were $3 each??  But wait!  Not only were the cocktails $3, but so were all of the apps we tried.  And oh, how delectable they were!

Mom's favorite app was the Spinach Artichoke Dip, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg#XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg which I found was too runny for my taste, but if she's happy, then I'm happy.  I was torn between the crunchy Artisan Grilled Cheese (brie, apple, fig jam) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg#jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg and the salty-creamy Prime Rib Dip (horseradish mayo, au jus).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ#k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ   The crunch factor I yearned for and did not get from the prime rib app, I found gratified w/ the grilled cheese.  Mmm... I think I've just decided where to go for happy hour after my massage appt. tomorrow!  LOL

Chef Daniel Boulud's triumphant return to Vegas.  This incarnation, a modern brasserie using the freshest, locally sourced, seasonal ingredients in updated, French classic dishes.  Intriguing elements in every dish brighten flavors and awaken the palate.  Add some beautifully imagined French craft cocktails; this is not your typical austere brasserie.

The requisite classics are there; a well made pate de champagne bourguignon with bits of this and that served with house made cornichons and whole grain mustard with bread, the authenticity of which is rarely tasted outside of Europe.  The obligatory shellfish plateau; a mountain of fresh seafood, begging for a glass of Sancerre.  The austere coq au vin, with it's perfectly braised pieces of chicken amidst lardoons, mushrooms and pearl onions.  All good but pale in comparison to dishes showcasing the chef's Michelin pedigree.

The artichoke veloute is incredible.  Velvety smooth.  Huge vegetal flavor of artichokes balanced with cream around a mushroom royale.  Bits of mushrooms provide texture.  A submerged "crouton" soaked in butter adds even greater richness.  Pair the dish with the "Bee's Knees" and be blown away by the complexity created by the sweetness, acidity, and richness.  The salmon rillettes, all the flavor of salmon, made smooth, rich, and creamy.  Hints of fennel add a wonderful anise notes, fried capers add texture and briny salinity.  Finally the dry aged Brandt ribeye.  Simply grilled served with a barnaise sauce, more acidic and with herbaceous notes than most that heightens the nutty, bleu cheese flavor of the steak.

Tip:  Lunch is a deal.  $26 for two courses, $33 for three.

Tip:  Match a craft cocktails with each dishes.  Cocktails are extremely complex with the use of many different bitters.  Most have great acidity.  Dare I say, perfect pairings work better than wine.

Very good wine list.  Heavy emphasis on France.  Decent vintage depth.   Best "value" in older vintages.  

Contemporary, bright ambiance.  Excellent, relaxed service.  You would never know the restaurant has been opened for only a month.

Definitely a welcome addition to the Vegas culinary scene.

It's almost been five years since we first started coming to Corleone's and nearly two and a half since my last review.

Corleone's hasn't changed much during that period of time, which is a very good thing.  You see, Corleone's is primarily a Philly Steak place that makes a great New York cheese pizza.  It's more authentic and tastier than either Ray's, or NYPD.

As a family, we order a few pies each month whenever we do not feel like cooking.  They deliver, but we like to visit and pick up our order.  Another east coast authentic food they offer are the Tastykakes snack food and warm pretzels.  I know this might appear to be trivial.  But, it's this attention to detail that impresses me most about Corleone's.  Yes, you could open a Philly cheese steak place, but would you bother to bring in Taskykakes?

A great thing about Corleone's is all the coupons they offer.  You order a pie, there's a coupon sticker on the box.  Open the mail, yep coupons there too.  They even have $2.00 off coupons on the top of your receipt.  So they're always hustling for your business.  But if the food wasn't good... it  wouldn't matter.

The 18 inch cheese pizza is still $8.99, less a two dollar coupon if you have one. LOL  It's thin and has the right amount of sauce and cheese.  It also flop when you pick it up.  Delicious!

Enjoy!~

Made a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.

The lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).

The Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.

Anyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.

Will I return?  No!

Whoa, I am in heaven. 

A recent review for a place in Chandler made me NEED some Filipino food. Let me back track a few years. 

I worked with a guy who was in charge of hiring for a drug wholesaler, he liked helping friends and family. He was a Polish Filipino. Some of the family he hired were Filipino and would bring Pancit, Lumpia, adobo etc to the potluck type lunches we had. I would even go to family functions with them. I love Filipino food. 

There was a place near me that closed down and I was left with no where to go. I drove past CFB but at the time it was only a bakery...lame 

After seeing the review for the place in Chandler, I had to find a closer place. SO I YELPED... sure enough there it was CFB. It is only 6 miles from work...sweet. 

I roll in and expect to see a dive but instead see a very clean, and larger then expected dining room. Attached was a bakery full of delights. 

I ordered the Pancit with chicken and veggies. It was freaking good. No soy or spicy sauce ALL the normal flavors. I also asked if I could sample some of the Lumpia and it was perfect, fresh, hot, and awesome. 

I will be back for some Adobo and some pastry's. 

They have karaoke on Friday, and a live band on Saturday. So you are warned.

Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's dcor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  

From a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose "carmalized" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.

At least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.

The Mad Onion staff were nice though, but this place is avoidable.

The typical New American seafood restaurant, with the prerequisite fresh raw bar and delicious, fish offerings sauced and dressed to turn the good into the sublime.  Solid.

So why Lakeside?  One word:  lobsters.

Lobster lovers, this might be one of the few opportunities to try four of the worlds best cold water varieties side by side.  Grab a friend.  This tasting is four mains, over four pounds, and a $450 price (don't gasp, you know you paid more for other "services" in Vegas)

Simply roasted in a wood burning oven and served with drawn butter.  Light smoke permeates the dense tail meat, enhancing its flavor while maintaining its juiciness.  Pronounced flavor differences make for a mind blowing tasting.  My notes:

1. Maine - Classic.  Clean flavor with a hint of celery.  Well balanced sweetness.  Firm texture.

2. West Australian - Incredibly sweet.  Citrus and cucumber back flavor.  Not as firm as the others but far from soft, pasty texture of warm water lobsters.

3. South Australian - A powerhouse.  Complex sweetness mixed with a subtle hint of fresh seaweed and iodine (Hawaii yeeps, think ogo).

4. South African - A blank canvas.  Enhanced by anything on it (ie herb citrus butter).  Firm texture.

Deserving of mention, the grilled octopus with white bean salad, sherry vinegar, and roasted garlic aioli starter is a party in your mouth with its charred bitterness on the octopus, sweet and sour of the vinegar, heat from the garlic and a creamy, richness from the aioli.  

The decor is modern and not for everyone.  Request an outdoor table.

Service is good with the only distraction from obnoxious diners taking calls on their mobiles.

Good wine list.  Resort prices.

Indulge.  It's Vegas!

Welcome to the latest video game to hit the Vegas Strip: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Douche! 

The object of the game is to pound the precise amount of liquor needed to create a vomit-stream powerful enough to coat the plastic tits of a demented party whore in a pucker-butt monokini from 50 yards, without pissing on yourself or otherwise soiling your Hurley boardshorts. Are YOU up to the challenge?!

Level I: Gain access to the inner sanctum by withstanding the searing desert sun for upwards of an hour, while standing shoulder to shoulder with idiots and assholes in a toxic cloud of self-tanner fumes and vodka breath, waiting in the endless line to get in. Survive the stench and the swamp-ass without passing out, and you've made it! 

Level II:
Run a gauntlet of insufferably dickish door staff. Figure out which ass to kiss/dick to suck/palm to grease. Pick the wrong one, and you'll end up being trampled by a herd of sunburned Ivy League frat boys being ushered in by the REAL door boss. Beware!

Level III:
Surrender your booty to the most invasive security checkpoint this side of Gaza. These guards check every cargo pants pocket, every mint-tin, every crevice on your nervously sweating body. If you're trying to bring drugs, ChapStick or excess I.Q. points in here, better stash 'em waaaaaaay up your ass...otherwise they WILL find them!

If you've made it this far, congrats! You're almost in; there's only one last boss to defeat: the cashier.

Hopefully you've been collecting coins throughout the game, cuz you're gonna need them. $50 gets you thru the turnstile, and then it's $20 per drink thereafter. Don't believe what you read or what they tell you on the phone -- the price at the door is GUARANTEED to be higher than what you were quoted. You can argue with the cashier, like the poor sap in front of me did...but you'll just end up looking like a sad, angry chump, and you'll end up caving and forking over more cash anyway so as not to embarrass your girlfriend. Vegas nightlife/daylife lesson: YOU CAN'T WIN. The club staff is always right, no matter what kind of bullshit bait & switch tactics they use.

The final challenges are elbowing your way through a pit of TapOut-wearing, tribal-tatted 'roid-ragers at the bar, then finding an inch of tepid piss-water to wallow in somewhere amidst the 5,000 fist-pumping guidos and drunkenly braying tramp-stamped college hags who pack the pool like beer-and-bronzer-coated sardines. 

Well, now you're in -- congratulations!! Better enjoy it while it lasts...because in a year or two, this game will end up in the 99cent clearance section at GameStop...right beside "ReHab: Kingdom of Fools" and "PURE: Megatwat's Folly."  

GAME OVER

SCUM BAGS! I wish i could give negative stars. came in here for them to fix my AC in my Mercedes since it all of a sudden just stopped working. The guy behind the counter told me he had put a ultra violet wash through my AC to see where it was leaking. That was 82$ My AC worked for about 4 days and once again went out. So i brought it back and the guy (at the same location) told me they couldn't see where it was leaking from. He started using his "mechanic talk" and told me he could fix it. 162$ later i paid in cash and it just so happened their printer wasn't working so i couldn't get a receipt. Then as i was leaving the other guy behind the counter (skinny, shorter) asked me if i had weed in my car. I said No and he said "Damn i was going to ask if i could buy some from you" uhhh WTF! 
And once again, my AC went out 3 days later. I ended up going to a different mechanic and told them about the UV flush. This mechanic took me into the shop and put up a black light and no trace of UV was seen. He ended up putting the flush through my car and 2 weeks later i took it back and he put the black light up again, you could clearly see the neon residue everywhere and where it was leaking.
I called the Big O Tires and spoke to a manager. I told him about what happened & he said there was nothing in the computer about me coming in the 2nd time, or paying any money. He also said their wasn't anything in my file about a UV flush. I felt so cheated and deceived. I really hope this review gets out there and lets everyone know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

Had a family wedding to attend this past weekend and most everyone was booked into "The New Tropicana."  I would never opt to stay at this end of the strip as it is a long schlep to the bumpin part. The monorail doesn't even come this far so you have to walk over to the MGM to catch it.

Well I was more than pleasantly surprised by the remod. Looks great, even smells great. My room was spacious and looked out on the strip as I was in the Paradise Tower, which BTW is closest to the casino and front door. No fridge, but I hear you can rent one for $10 per night. 

What was most impressive was the friendly staff. Everyone from the two check-in ladies, to the convenience store and house cleaning staff were all smiles. They really did a great job on their hires. The pool area has also undergone a remod and while it ain't the Wynn pool, it is very nice with plenty of shade for pale faces like me. 

The lounge is conveniently located by the Paradise Tower elevators, and the band jamming there on Friday - Sunday was a funky good time. We spent around an hour there all three nights before going out for the evening. 

Would I stay here again? Would not be my first choice because of the location, but if family or friends were already booked I would gladly join in again.

I'm ashamed to share that my 10-year old bike still has the hair on the tires, AND the tires were flat from having been in my storage shed for 6 years. Figured it was a good idea to get a tune up (and a helmet) before trying to ride again! 

The shop owner was so nice! $40 for the tune up and even though it was going to be ready later that day, he advised I leave it a bit to make sure the tires didn't need a new tube (they didn't). 

He patiently showed me how to put the bike rack on my car - even though I didn't buy it from him, I just brought it from home. 

He didn't try to sell me the most expensive option of the accessories and in the end, I got a tune up, a helmet, a bike lock and a headlight for $128 (including tax). 

He taught me about the gears on my bike and gave me a map of all the bike paths in Phoenix! All the while, charming banter. I feel like I've made a new friend! 

Not only can you buy bicycles and any accessory you may need for your bike at this little shop on Hatcher Road, I understand you can rent bikes here too; and, the shop is right by the canal so if you don't already own a bike but feel like riding, this would be a great launching point. 

Of course, I SAY that... let's see if I actually get on mine now...

Met a colleague for lunch here the other day.  It's been a while since I've been to Lawry's and I was excited to see if it was still as good as I remember.  It's near the Howard Hughes business area so there's always a ton of businessmen and women having lunch here on weekdays.  With this in mind, we decided to meet at 11:30 am (opening time) to beat the lunch rush.

I went up to the chef and ordered a BBQ Beef Sandwich ($12), Cup of Chili ($5), and an Iced Tea ($3).  The BBQ Beef Sandwich was very good.  The Beef was juicy and the BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and not too sweet....just the way I like it.  The one negative for me was the amount of Sauce, I would have preferred less Sauce.....you can't control the amount of Sauce though, it's served that way.

The Chili was amazing!  It is easily the best Chili I've ever had.  It's not for Vegetarians though.....there's Beef in the Chili.  The combination of ingredients was perfect....I wish I knew what was in it!  It also had a slight spicy kick to it too.

The atmosphere is upscale and professional, perfect for our lunch meeting.  Overall, it was a great experience.

Hint - If you want to try their amazing Prime Rib but don't want to pay the Dinner prices, come for lunch and get the Lunch Cut Prime Rib, which was $20 I believe.

Did I get Value for my money?  Yes.
Will I return?  Absolutely.

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

The Brits have an expression, "Smart by half.' 

I was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a "Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th" email .

I ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads "order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free".  Silly me.

The two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow

So yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two "Regular" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.

At this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, "Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?" LOL

Sorry, Two Stars and  "Meh. I've experienced better."

"Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli!"

It was a beautiful Friday morning when the Lunch Bunch assembled and got some delicious steamy food.  Being the Duke of the new and cozy Carlo & Emilie's, Brett B. had planned this outing for us.  After browsing the menu, I decided on ordering the mascarpone cheese and butternut squashed filled ravioli in the browned butter sauce.  

That first bite was a surprise!  I had ordered it thinking it would be a nice savory dish and instead, sweetness was the first thing I tasted.  The browned butter sauce had sage and sugar so it felt like I was eating little pillows with pumpkin pie-esque filling.  It's not exactly a bad thing but it was definitely unexpected.  I feel like I can say I had dessert for lunch.  The garlic bread included was super flavorful.  Bread is made fresh daily and they even sell loaves [and they sell out fast].  Everything was homemade and made with love.

At 11:30am, the quaint little place filled up fast and we sat in the outdoor patio to enjoy the nice, brisk, December air.  They have patio heaters set out so don't let it deter you away if you want to enjoy a nice dinner outdoors while staying toasty.  We also got to speak with the owners Carlo and Emilie and they're absolutely adorable and charming.  I wish them all the best in their new business!

I'm going to start a petition to officially change the name from Las Vegas to Line Vegas. Step off the plane, wait in the taxi line.  Get to the buffet, wait in another line. Go to a club?  Wait in line.
So it shouldn't have surprised me to see the line to check in at the Mandalay Bay.  But that was pretty much the only negative to our stay.
Our room was great - huge HDTV flatscreen, big bathroom (with another tv set - score!) alarm clock with built in iPod dock.  When we checked in we asked for a room up high...not only did we get that but also a pool view.

A couple of tips - 
#1 Definitely request a room with a pool view and close to the elevator when you check in.

#2 Double check your bill before you leave the room...they had charged us $30 for mini bar items that we didn't drink because they have sensors in the fridge that could tell we lifted the bottles up to take a look at them (mini Patron bottles are so damn cute!)
They promptly reversed the charges as soon as we told them what happened.

I would highly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay and will definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Line, eh, Las Vegas.

"Everything sounds normal; prawns, scallops, uni, crab, beef, pork.  Nothing I haven't seen.  Is it your cooking techniques" begins my poker bud to the perplexed server.

"Uhhh, I'm sorry".  his replay

"What makes your meats bizarre?" he asks, as I loose it.  OK maybe I should have corrected him as he misspoke the name the entire afternoon but...

Bizarre it's not but a bazaar of flesh, yes.

Begin the meal sampling some of Andres best creations from Bazaar LA.  Modernist cuisine treats that tease the senses and palate.  Top props to the famous cotton candy foie with its unadulterated sweetness that heightens the rich, livery, flavor of foie.  Also worthy, the Asian taco (iberico ham on nori with flying fish roe).  Great complexity starting with the nuttiness of the ham, quickly building with the briny, oceanic caviar and finishing with a huge umame punch.  The liquid olives and giant chicharrons are also great.

The raw bar, different.  No shrimp cocktail here.  If in season, the lightly poached, head on spot prawn is to die for.  Uber sweet, it's flavor comes alive with the dusting of ginger salt.  Sucking the head fat, one of life's great pleasures.  The geuduck, candy from the sea.  Great texture, its natural sweetness well controlled by the addition of yuzu, soy, ginger and especially fresh lemon that brightens the dish.  Finally, an outstanding abalone.  Tender, served with a dashi gelee, and a lemon, soy  sauce.  Again, the strong citrus component and racy acidity brings out the natural sweetness.

Worthy of mention is their vittore 1950 tenderloin carpaccio.  Very traditional preparation, the mildly sweet sherry "dressing" with its nutty overtones perfectly expresses the beef's flavor.  A classic beef tartare equally good with just the right amount of anchovies to bring out the umame finish on the beef.  

A great selection of cured meats.  Stick to the imported jamon iberico de bellaota.  As perfect of an example of this great ham as any.  Beautiful pork flavor with the perfect nutty finish.

Finally the beef.  Sold by the pound (the thicker the better, share).  All well trimmed, wood grilled, and tender, cooked to temp.  All lack long aging, and therefore the umame finish.  Three breeds of cattle.  The black angus, good "American" beef flavor.  The wagyu, sweeter and mildly beefy.  The hybrid washugyu, the best blend of beefy flavor and sweetness that pairs perfectly with the bitterness of the grill.  Sadly, the top steak (A4 Japanese rib eye from Hyogo prefecture) is just OK.   Seasoned with salt then over cooked (ordered blue, served mid rare).  The joy of eating beef of this quality is to allow the fat to melt in the mouth, not be released on the plate.  Seasoning each slice right before enjoying it is also a must.

Very good, friendly service.

Very good wine list.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

A solid steakhouse that excels at non steak dishes.

Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. 

The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.

The funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.

What a spiritual, uplifting Catholic Community!

From the opening notes of the hymn, "All are welcome in this place", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

"Let us build a house
where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive."

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

"Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew."

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

"Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet."

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. 

"Here the love of God, through Jesus,
Is revealed in time and space;
As we share in Christ the feast that frees us:

All are welcome, all are welcome,
All are welcome in this place."

The success of Hash House may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in Vegas. Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas). 

Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU. 

It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that. 

Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.

One sentence... IT'S WORTH THE MONEY. Lifetime fitness is truly a way of life, not just a gym. With three stories of endless equipment, classes, and a rock climbing wall you will find everything you need here. 

My boyfriend and I recently joined and have spent a vast majority of our free time using all lifetime has to offer. With two pools (one inside and one outside) a health cafe, various fitness classes (i live to practice yoga) and numerous machines it's very easy to spend the day here. 

I recently have been using the steam room as well. It's infused with eucalyptus... Need I say more?

My personal trainer Emily has been amazing as well. I'm really enjoying our sessions and the results.

I highly recommend this place to anyone. The price of $144 a month is a little steep for some but making that commitment make me want to work out even harder. 

If you're looking for a gym in the summerlin area this place is worth a trial.

I can't write about the amazing po' boys. The glorious boudin. The succulent fried green tomatoes. I especially can't write about the to-die-for peach cobbler a la mode.

I can't write about it because I can't eat it anymore. I'm a little verklempt, please give me a moment...

Ahem. Okay, that's better.

Try the gumbo if you want to live dangerously, it's spicy! And the crawfish boil is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, if also one of the messiest.

Go and eat all of the things. When you do, please have a shrimp po' boy for me.

I'll just be over here, hoping for a miracle drug that allows me to ingest gluten. If that dream ever becomes a reality, Flavors of Louisiana will definitely be my first stop.

UPDATE: I received the following message from the owner:

Hi Beth, Man do i have good news for you. We have a lot of Gluten free items on our menu!!! Yes i was a nurse for 25 years before opening my restaurant and Celiac disease was just becoming a known thing. So we can blacken any of our meats for you with our gluten free blackening seasoning. Also we fry in a mixture of corn meal and corn flour so no wheat flour goes in it. Just ask for your fried foods to be done in the cornmeal mixture instead of the flour. We have french fries, cajun chips, potato salad, cole slaw, dirty rice and red beans are all gluten free. Also if you come on Monday we have our Jambalaya and that is gluten free as well. So come on back and let us feed you some good and i mean real good gluten free food!!

Booked the Penthouse and all i can say is....WOW!!!!

The panoramic view of the strip from the corner Penthouse was breathtaking and the spacious rooms were elegant, modern & clean.  The beds you ask? Nice and firm, just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol
Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily "turn down" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.
If you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence, this just might be your ticket to paradise.

Happy Times!

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

There's dining in the dark, and then there's wining in the dark. Yes, it's so dark in here that you won't want to bother trying to read their bible of a wine list - just ask your server for some recommendations. And because it's so dimly lit in here, it's a great spot for getting cozy and romantical with that someone special. The space is quite hidden, but once you make your way inside, you'll find a pretty huge space. There is tons of seating, so it's also a nice wine bar for gathering with friends. 

There's live music or a DJ on a nightly basis, so you not only get wonderful wines here, but a fun atmosphere. It's one of those places that you can spend hours on end at, but mix it up and have a nice dinner before or after at their sister spot around the corner, Cowboy Ciao. Makes for a perfect date night!

Try their Boom Boom Syrah and get a mix of cheeses and meats to nibble on. Great thing is that you don't have to worry about having purple teeth or food on your face. Your date won't be able to notice it at all!

Owner Scott Conant (the dude from Chopped) hates raw onions. Therefore, I don't trust him... half kidding

I think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).

Undeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.

Oysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request

Stracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.

Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-P

Black Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..). 

Ribeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.

**don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oil

One of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? Hmmm

Good food, okay service.

If you're looking for good authentic Asian food in the Venetian in Vegas, this is your place.  However, like many of the very authentic Asian restaurants, the service was completely lacking.  Our waitress visited our table only twice, once to take our order and the second time to bring the bill.  Otherwise a server brought our food, and no stopped by again to ask if we needed anything else. 

I tired to send back a plate because it wasn't what I wanted, and the hostess essentially told me "no", because they'd through the food away and it'd be wasted... so I just kept it and ate, but after a few more bites it wasn't all that bad after all  :-)

I guess what they lack in service they make up for in the food.

Electric Daisy Carnival is not just a destination, a place, a celebration, a setting, or a music festival. It's a life changing experience, an adventure... a magical wonderland! It was an ethereal, surreal journey. 

This year EDC is my first and I would not change it in any other way because of the memories we created together with friends and the new. So much fun/cool experience! 

There is no way I can describe EDC because you have to be there in order to feel the experience with other 350,000+ people. 

The goods: 
-The largest rave in America stretched out approx. 1.5-2 miles apart with over 350,000+ attendees. Holy. 
-Spectacular decors and stage set ups. I loved the Kinetic Field set up the most! That celestial castle mimicked Little Mermaid's castle of gold or Disney's Sleeping Beauty castle or some form of cathedral structure! Very remarkable and incredible. THE LIGHT INSTALLATIONS ARE PHENOMENAL! Now I can understand why Insomniac spent over $35 million dollars+ toward the productions. 
-It goes from dusk to sunrise. 
-Free water, but the line can be cruel-some. Stay hydrated please!
-65+ carnival rides are fun to ride with your friends and make good memories. 
-The artists! Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Dash, Avicii, Kaskade, Carnage, Alesso, and all of the biggest EDM DJs you know. 
-You'll meet some of the friendliest people on the planet. I got to PLUR with some of amazing new friends! 
-THE FIREWORKS. 

-The bads: 
-Beer is overpriced.. $8 for a can of Budlight? 
-No cell signal, so don't rely on catching receptions. Bring some walkie talkies.
-Parking. It's the worst when trying to get out of Speedway. 
-Traffic. It takes minimum of 45 minutes to 4 hours to get to the carnival from the Strip. 
-Running out of toilet papers in the rest rooms, so bring some for yourself. 

All in all, I had the best experience with friends I will forever cherish! This is something everyone in their 20s should experience once in their lifetime.

Thank you Pasquale Rotella, CEO and Founder of Insomniac Productions, for making this happen every year. It was literally the BEST WEEKEND OF MY LIFE surrounded with good and positive vibes. Rolling bowling balls. Awesome kandis. Oh my gawd, awesome DJs. PLUR. Sleep is for the weak. #insomiac. EAT SLEEP RAVE REPEAT!

See you next year under the electric sky!

I LOVE THIS PLACE.

The ONLY downside is that it's an addictive little treat.  Every day is such a "hard" day, and my back "always hurts" topped off with "well, it's only $35, my husband won't care."  I mean, others treat themselves every morning to a $5 caffeine riddled cup of coffee adorned with whip cream - is that really any different to treating oneself to a massage every week?  Or every couple of days?

Exactly.  People need massages like coffee.

There are a few things that make this place so easily accessible, unlike other  massage parlors.  

1) No appointment necessary.  You can literally decided you need a massage and 10 minutes later be getting one.
2) It is next to Sprouts.  It's not my fault I have to go to the grocery store.
3) It is open late (until 10pm) and on weekends.  
4) It is cheap.  $35 (plus tip) for one hour.  $45 if you really want to go crazy and get the hot stones.
5) You can even get a massage while doing yoga.  In this case, massage = exercise.

I really cannot think of anything bad to say about this place.  They soak your feet in warm water, and while it is called a "foot massage", they also massage your neck and arms and your hands and head.  And, then it gets better -- they flip you over and massage your back.

Everyone is good but I recommend Tony.  To know my knowledge there is at least three men named Tony...but do not fret, there is no need to specify, every Tony is amazing.

Consider me a big fan!  

I was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   

Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. 

The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  

But man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.

Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, I brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  The restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  Music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.

As for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  My friend and I were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and I got the Drunken Monkey (with Reese's, banana, malt, and Frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the Creamsicle Float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  My biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark Asian flush go into effect).  Perhaps the Holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.

As for the burgers, we opted to split the crowd favorite Gold Standard and Steakhouse Burger.  The Gold Standard consists of dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in Charlie Brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  The Steakhouse burger, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms,  and swiss cheese.  Taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to Marquee on this one.  For every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  

Overall, the burgers  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction,  "That's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. I don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good."

Let's try to write another review since my last one was taken off for "personal attacks."

I will keep this one short and sweet. The food at this place is very average. Without a groupon that gives you 50% off, this place would be very over priced for the quality of food one is served. The food averages around $10-$13 and although that may not be too pricey, I feel as if any random guy could cook the same quality of food. 

As the service goes, from reading other reviews it has come apparent to me that neither the owner nor servers are very nice. I don't like an owner who trolls on yelp to only dismiss and refuse to accept any bad reviews (the reason why my last review was deleted). 

I will not come back to this place to stand up for those who the owner has verbally attacked. In addition, the food isn't great and won't be missed.

So you want to go to a stadium that sits on top of the field and stacks up vertically? Well my first trip here definitely made me feel like that was the case. This is an extremely unique and interesting facility.

This place is built into the saddle between two hills on the edge of the ASU campus. I know as I walked around the entire area in armor. it was fun to traipse around and see what is going on out there. There is easy freeway access and a large bar scene to the southwest. I also enjoyed that they had a bunch of parking structures to help facilitate the crowds that may come to a few games here and there. The parking opens up between 5 and 7 hours before game time. Kinda crazy that you have to pay a bit extra for an early arrival but hey it is what it is. Not a huge amount of time IMHO either. I guess that is something that I find extra special about USC games. You can tailgate from 4 or 5am until whenever the game starts and after if you wish. Here that is not the same situation.

The stadium itself is very tight. I havent sat int he stands so I dont know what the sight lines are like. I have been in the pressbox, admin building, visitor press area, and on the field. The stadium itself feels very close to the field, from the field. 

Pro Tip: They hand out mini programs as you go to your seats off of each aisle.

The ingress and egress for the fans is very crowded. This is true especially for the lower levels around the field. Do not expect to be able to exit the stadium very quickly after a game. I have no idea how the upper levels enter or exit. 

The overall design is pretty kewl. However I wasnt too excited about the north end being on the field level and the southend being raised 15-20 feet over the field. Regardless, there is a lot to be impressed by with this stadium. I definitely like it much more than a place like UNLV, UNR, SJSU, etc. Hell I like it more than I like the Rosebowl as well. 

So yeah I would love to watch a game here and I would definitely enjoy heading back for another game or two.

Horribly sweaty girl is hungry after Critical Mass.  Cheese on the mind.  Critical Mass ended by going down Central and I had never been to Cheuvront before.  Luckily, I was with Ayesha and it took nothing to convince her to go there.  
There were 7 of us and they were extremely quick in pushing table together for us.  They didn't even mind our sweat and water bottles.  The server even filled Ayesha's for her.  
I took one look at the menu and my eyes stopped at the bottom: macaroni and cheese.  I rarely eat it, but as soon as I saw it, I wanted.  Badly.  Ayesha said she liked the bleu cheese.  SOLD!  I effing love bleu cheese.  
For $8, I think it was a good value.  It was a good portion, but not too much.  Rich and creamy with gargantuan hunks of genuine bleu cheese, that had started to melt.  It was incredibly filling for the size!
Downfall: Unisex bathrooms.  What the hell!  I don't care how nice a place is, guys still piss all over the place.
The mac and cheese is $5 during the week during happy hour.  I will be back for it, most definitely!
Huge points for the server who took Amy in stride when I told him I'd spank his ass for something.  (I don't remember, as it was 109 degrees and I had been on my bike for over 2 hours.)

Coca~Cola... Iconic. Powerful. Unique.  Why did you have to make this place? In Lost Wages of all places, you may know it as Sin City, or a debaucherous den of sex drugs gambling and prostitution... ohhhh wait, what a PERFECT place to put a family destination =D

Pro Tip: Free Samples... great if you drink the fizzy stuff... and some are floats!!!

Why didn't I think of that? I guess that is why I don't get paid the big bucks... regardless this place is the ultimate homage to the power of swag and branding... I do not know of a single other item that is universally known in every corner of the globe nearly half as well as coke... It's everywhere. The only thing crazier is the weirdo's who want all of the coke swag...

Pro Tip #2: Leave your tooth in coke overnight and it will dissolve =X

So if when I still drank soda, I would have been here, I would have enjoyed it much more than as I got older and realized how evil and bad for you coke really is. At this point, I use it more as a solvent than anything else...

Pro Tip #3: Clean grease off your garage floor, car engine parts, or battery terminals by soaking it in coke or another type of soda, preferably flat...

None the less for all of my tongue in cheek stuff about coke, it is an awesome story and they have a lot of accomplishments for a company... I just think this is a poor choice for a Coke themed facility as I would have thought it was more child oriented. 

Overall this is an interesting place to visit and not half as cheesy as the M&M joint nearby. None the less... it is what it is...

Today, Hubby and I rode from Jefferson and 12th St. (the stop closest to our house) to Mill Ave. and 3rd St. in Tempe to check out the Metro Rail and have lunch at Rula Bula. Christ Almighty, it was crowded. Both ways we waited for the next train because there was no room on the first one. There was really no room on the second one either, but it was squish or not bother going. I can also see that there will need to be some training of Valley passengers regarding rail etiquette:

1. Give the people getting OFF the cars a freaking second to do so before barrelling in. 
2. Don't sit on the floor of the car. Not only are you more likely to get stepped on (especially if the conductor sucks, and the one on the return trip had a lead foot), but you are also taking up 2-3 times the space of someone standing. 
3. Wear deodorant, people.
4. There's no need for you to stand on the edge of the platform and crane to see the cars coming. It will not make the Metro Rail come any faster.
5. Be considerate of others, and maybe not rap loudly about "it's yo' birf-day, so I'm a-gonna kill you," on a crowded rail car. 

Now, I do have high hopes for the Metro Rail, and Hubby and I already have plans to use it again this week- but we'll be waiting until the free days are over. Full? I hope it will be. Crazy, chaotic, and dangerous? We hope that will not be the case regularly. There were many people around us who admitted they were riding it with no destination at all, just back and forth, up and down. Wish I had that much free time.

I AM HUGE!  

This would be another great opening for a "that's what she said" zinger. But, at this buffet there is no denying that my stature was indeed grandiose.  Everything's served in miniature crockery, pans, fryers, cones, and cups.  I truly felt like the jolly yellow giant in jack's miniature string bean kitchen. 

This however is where the rubber meets the road and smaller in this case is not necessarily a good thing.  Because the portions are served in smaller individual servings, they tend to dry out pretty fast if you fail to get things as soon as they're put out.  While there were numerous items to choose from, over half of them were just too dried out or hard, which included:
- The pork belly sliders.
- The mac 'n cheese was too dried out and not cheesy enough.
- The al pastor tacos were quite disappointing and also very dried out (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=bTym4e_dO56vo_I-X0jVSw).
- The Prime Rib was a bit rubbery.
- The Korean short ribs were chewy and in par with the quality of a young dong tofu house.
- The salads a bit wilted and torn.

The miniature dishes that were really good:
- The miniature fryers of sweet tater fires (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=jeUB9sk3TPj5gLBViw6WFw).
- The creamed corn and red wine braised mushrooms were surprisingly tasty.
- The Pot Roast served in a miniature Dutch oven (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gQSN3CUgWdMXuDi814bwRA).

I think the highlight were the desserts. And they were numerous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gYly1GSdQl1ivFLbLUS2FQ).
- Metallic-colored egg shells that were filled with egg crme and topped with miniature macarons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=F4Tl5-voNvQV2OnOP_m1Vg).  
- Gelato, gelato, gelato - so many flavors to choose from and taste.
- Hundreds of cups of filled purees, creams, and genache of vibrant colors and tastes.  Some good, and some bad (almost like what were you thinking kinda bad).
- Chocolate covered strawberries were great.

I think we caught the dessert guy in his off day; very grumpy and stern.  However the help switches out often and you'll probably never see this guy anyways. 

So it was great to finally experience this miniature world and truly feel like a giant.  The prices are actually quite reasonable; $21 for Lunch and $29 for Dinner.  Food wise, this was a solid 2.5, but given the price, it's a 3.  But this is Vegas and Buffets are numerous.  So on to the next one!

The best meal I have had in a very long time. I'm so excited to review this place i don't even know where to start...!

Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish!
We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting. 
Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it.
We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness.
Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees. 
Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination.
Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me.
I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink. 
We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio. 

This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.

Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy, but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food.  
Might not be a burger, fry, and shake diner, but New Mexican cuisine is American all the way, and as a matter of fact, among their many southwestern tinged dishes, they've got a superb thick, juicy burger, grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar, with some great fries AND a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish (last I was aware).

I was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  

The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.

I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.

For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.

My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  

As I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.

I always say when it comes to Asian restaurants especially Chinese and Taiwanese - the crappier the service, the better the food. Tony T's ROTD reminded me to take this off my bookmarked places.

Xiao Long Bao:
You get 9 baos for $7. I can't help but compare XLB I've had in Shanghai and Taipei to everyone else's version. I'm very happy to say that I've found my XLB spot here in Vegas! The bao had the perfect thickness, the soup inside was hot and delicious. Glowing and glistening 5/5

Fried Tofu with Mixed Mushrooms:
Even though the tofu pieces were fried, they were soft. The mushrooms were tasty but they slide off your chopsticks. The brown sauce was good. 4/5

Beef Noodle Soup:
Our server warned me this was spicy. I appreciate it when they do that but I had a cold anyway so, bring on the heat! I could taste cumin. My nose started running - I'm not sure if it was from the spiciness or my cold...or both. The beef chunks were fatty so I had to eat around it since I'm not a fan of animal fat. I had 2 pieces of bok choy and tender noodles in my bowl. 3.5/5

Pork Loin in Red Garlic Sauce:
I didn't even know we ordered this. Shredded pork with red bell pepper strips. This reminded me of a thick and meatier version of Hot & Sour soup. 3.5/5

Steamed Shrimps in House Garlic Sauce:
Head on, butterflied but not all shrimps got de-veined. But the sauce was fantastic! Nice and garlicky. One of the better ways I've had shrimp. 4.5/5

They have street food you'll find in China like frog legs, chicken organ meat on a stick, etc.There were items we wanted to try but they no longer serve them like: enoki mushroom beef roll, pork belly with preserved vegetable(s)They need to update their menu. Even our server said it. They need to remove items they no longer serve and correct the typos. I'll definitely come back for XLB!

Yesterday was a mistake.

We had a Unofficial Yelp Event setup by Phoenix Buffet King Rand H., along with Masha Z., Arlin B., Mike C., Robyn N., Norm R. and myself.  We were early I guess, arriving at Macaroni Grill just after they opened at 11:10.  

I couldn't tell if there was any other employees here, because the only one who greeted us was the Bartender. Not a good sign.

This foreboding aside, we had a very nice time. One of us bought the table two appetizers, while another a half-priced 1.5 liter bottles of Italian "red" wine. If we stopped there, along with the bread and EVOO, we would have rated Macaroni Grill a lot higher.  

BTW, our bartender/ server, order taker, chief bottle washer was outstanding!  Though she looked tired towards the end of our visit, after covering several tables and the bar!

I ordered the Lunch Combination "Duo" of Caesar Salad and the Capellini Pomodoro pasta.  Both were very good but pricey at $8.50. The bones of the menu are very good. But it looks like the cost accountants are running the restaurant again.  This was the same problem back when Brinkers (Chili's) tried to increase the margins a few years ago.

Let me be specific.  The serving bowls were tiny, tiny, tiny three inch, by three inch ceramics (see photos). So even when you add a delicious, well prepared, flavorful pasta dish, along with a salad in the same size bowl -- how do you charge $8.50? The same pasta dinner comes in a huge bowl for $11.00. So, if this is a business person's lunch, then I probably wouldn't be returning.

Sorry!  I guess I was wrong.  The old Macaroni Grill isn't back.

Lone Mountain looks small but it's bizarrely difficult to reach the top and get down without falling. Congratulations to DANIEL S. for being the 1st man on Yelp to conquer this mountain.

Every night, a rescue helicopter circles the top of the mountain with a light to see if there are any hikers who have become stranded.  This is a dangerous hike and many people get injured. When I reached the summit, I could not believe there were actually memorials  set up for people who didn't make it to the top. I had an interesting conversation with a lady I met on the summit, she told me a story about how a lot of people had fallen off the steep ledges because of the loose rocks that slide the moment  you step on them. She also told me that people have attempted to drive their dirt bikes up the trail and have fallen to their deaths. To make things worse, when you get to the last 500 feet, the rocks are razor sharp. I am not even exaggerating, my shoes were completely shredded after the hike. I can't imagine tripping and falling onto these razor blade rocks. 

There is an "easy" trail they set up to get to the summit, but it's not technically easy. On the other side of the mountain, they have a much more difficult route that requires you to actually use your hands to climb. 

About 30% up the mountain you will find a park bench. I'm not sure who put this here. The bench is badly vandalized by pot heads and there are usually tons of empty beer cans, bottles, and smoked blunts surrounding the area. 

Once you get to the very top of the mountain, you won't have much space to stand so you gotta be careful. It's a great view, to the right you can see the Red Rock and Summerlin areas. Directly below you, you can see Majestic Park and the North West territory. To the left, you can see Providence, Centennial, and Aliante. You can even see all the way to Sunrise Mountain. And on a really nice day you can see to that area where Railroad Pass is.

During my hike, I witnessed countless grown men give up at the half way point. But oddly, a group of 9 year old girls easily  made it to the top and they weren't even breathing hard.

Review #300.  

Fishes welcome!  OOPS.  Freudian slip.

When you grind for a living, you can't let out your secrets; except on Yelp and a milestone review.  That said, this is a review for the recreational player.

The Venetian is the best managed, most comfortable, poker room in Vegas.  Friendly dealers, knowledgeable floors, comfortable seats, well spaced tables, huge number of monitors, food and beverage service, even massage service (not the happy ending variety).

Great game selection for low and mid stakes players (NLHE, LHE, O8B, PLO, Open face Chinese, and the occasional mixed game).  Word of caution, the low limit 2/5NLHE ($200-$1000 buyin) games are frequented by Vegas grinders.  Special note to LA players, the mid limit games like the 5/10NLHE ($400 - no max) and 10/20NLHE ($800 - no max) are tougher than those at Commerce.  They play deep stack with the typical buyin 1,000 BB.

Best attended daily tourneys for the casual player. Offered twice a day, they feature low buyin, decent prize pool, a good amount of play and a soft field.

Great tourney series (Deep Stack) that occur multiple times a year.  Mid range buyin's.  Good structure.  Good mix of players.  Great prize pools.

Single table turbo SNGs run throughout the year but pickup during the Deep Stack series.  Various buyins.  Always 10 players and two winners paid in casino checks (no lamers).

Great comp system ($2 per hour for cash games).  Comps can be accumulated and used for table side food service.  Seriously, there's nothing like handling checks and cards for hours then picking up that juicy burger right?  You only have Montezuma revenge once.

Final tip:  Try the espresso.  It comes with a crystallized sugar stick.  Double rush!

Pull up a chair and enjoy!

If you're a fan of modern Japanese -- the kind that Nobu made popular and places like Social House reimagined -- you'll love the food at Soho. The chef owner is the former executive chef at Social House and has brought his fusion-style of cooking to the 'burbs. That means Strip-quality food at off-Strip prices.

The strip mall location is nothing special and the interior is quaint and understated. But, it's the food that shines at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with the yellowtail yuzu soy ($10), tuna or hamachi tostadas ($2 ea.), or the angus gyoza ($5). The miso marinated black cod ($18) is as good as any I've had on or around the Strip (including the one at Nobu).

The variety of rolls may be limited, but the quality and execution is solid. This is not an all you can eat place, so expect to spend a little more for a higher end product.

The subtle sweetness and silky creaminess of the vanilla creme brulee ($5) was a great way to end the meal. If chocolate is your thing, try the chocolate mousse ($7). It's the perfect balance of sweet and bitter chocolate with cocoa crumbles and cookie pieces to add variety in texture.

The chef/owner stopped by to chat, which is always a nice touch to show that he cares about the diner's experience. With beautifully presented and well crafted food, Soho is a welcome addition to the local scene. For people on a budget, like myself, it's just another reason to dine in the 'burbs instead of the Strip.

Had it not been for the Illuminations Half Marathon http://www.yelp.com/biz/illuminations-half-arizona-phoenix, I would have never known...never known that set amidst the majestic Sonoran Desert and surrounded by the beautiful McDowell Mountains--rows upon prickly rows of saguaro cacti maintaining their century-old vigils--sits JW Marriott's spectacular Desert Ridge Resort.

People golf here, it seems.  I mean, the Marriott shoulders two championship golf courses, ones designed in part by Arnold Palmer, and they look seriously cool...if you're a golfer.  I'm not.  In fact, I hate golfing.  Rather, I came here to run.  And these courses, illuminated for the Half Marathon with hundreds and hundreds of glowsticks, were great fun nonetheless--beautiful, even after sundown.

The amenities at the Marriott--lazy river, heated pools, spa, fitness center, tennis courts (to name a few)--were impressive.  And although I hadn't the time to explore them--my stay was short--I took notice, traveling about the resort, snapping a few shots.  Next time--and I'm sure there'll be a next time--I'll give them a try.  What was nice, though, was simply waking early, grabbing a Peppermint Mocha from the in-house Starbucks, and sitting outside, fire pit cozy.  I love mornings!  And in Phoenix, it seems, some golfers enjoy mornings too.

This Asian fusion restaurant has created quite a buzz with their steamed buns and happy hour menu. The frontal open patio can be a great place for hanging out and people watching during the not-so-hot seasons. By extension, the modern, immaculate interior encompasses large see-through glass windows, full bar, rows of tables, and touches of Asian artifacts. The atmosphere is completely hipsterish. Fellow Yelper Tony Y. Jr was in town for a visit, so we stopped by for happy hour and a light meal.

The Roasted Pork Belly Steamed Bun ($4.50) was served with hoisin, cilantro, and peanuts. The soft and fluffy steamed buns were addictive, but they were also pre-packaged and not made from scratch. The pork belly was tasty, but could be steeped in seasoning and roasted for a longer period of time. The touches of sauce and garnishes added some depth. It was a decent option, but the taste of the pork belly has to be more striking than it appeared. 

The Peking Duck Steamed Bun ($4.50) was put together with bacon, mizuna, and charred plum jam. The dry spots on the duck tasted oven baked with confit-like textures. The depth of seasoning was lacking the deep star anise flavors. The sauce and garnishes gave a nice savory and sweet contrast. Again, the duck should be a lot more robust and flavorful to add twists to the soft fluffy buns.

The Pork Ramen ($7) comes with braised pork belly, ribs, scallion, mustard green, kimchi, hearts of palm, and poached egg. They recently raised the happy hour prices but should really kept it at $5. The pork belly had a good fatty to meat ratio, but the broth was steeped with mustard green flavor that prevented the pork fat and shoyu to anchor the chewy egg noodles. The runny poached egg was a Western cop out on what is supposed to be soft-boiled egg. For what it is worth, I would only pay $5 for it. 

I've been here on many other occasions and service was attentive on most of my visits. I didn't get to review their other menu items, but there was overall a breadth of originality that did not translate into the kinds of sharp flavors, depth, refinement, and wow factors expected in the execution. 2.5 stars, I will only return when I'm invited to come hang out with friends.

Cronuts & Yelpers are what drew me to this place. Saturday morning and all a buzz with the breakfast crowd. Just walking by, you want to come in and be a part of this hip looking establishment. My inner sweet tooth wanted to climb over the dessert window upon entering. This is no average bakery. The desserts are plump and inviting and not the standard grocery store baked goods that are a dime a dozen.
Today we came for the much anticipated CRONUT that I couldn't wait to try and even called to make sure they had them. Dominic was nice enough to set aside some for me. Well my proverbial eyes were much, much too big to handle what we would encounter. In doing a little research on the cronut, I thought they would be manageable sized "croissant donuts". So I told them to hold 6. Lo and behold, we get to the counter and see that each cronut is sliced and layered in between is a rich vanilla custard. 6 was an overkill. The girl at the counter was nice enough to take back a few when our eyes bugged out at the $30 tab. The cronuts were much heavier and more dense than I would have liked. They tasted good, but I didn't want to waste my whole weekend's caloric limit on 1 cronut. I would have preferred them much lighter and similar to a croissant texture. But I'm glad we tried Bread & Butter as this may become our weekend breakfast spot.

I had this crazy fantasy that Mario Batali himself was in the back grinding up Carnevino's riserva, ribeye and porterhouse cuts to be made into patties.  Not exactly the case but the guys behind one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas definitely know beef.  So a visit here was inevitable despite the mixed reviews.

Before B&B burger opened, Batali himself said "The food will be easier to accept if you've never heard of me."  Everyone comes to expect so much with his name on the front.  

My verdict: a damn good burger!  We ordered what most reviewers got and also what the servers recommended.  The "Morning After" was everything I want in a good burger.  The patty was a very juicy medium rare.  The egg on top looked and tasted so perfect upon my first bite which then turned into a beautiful mess of yolk everywhere.  The bun itself was excellent with a kind of croissant quality to it.  I was only able to notice it after eating part of the bun separately though.  The royale with cheese was also very good and my wife preferred this more with all its caramelized onion glory.

I still would have paid more for a riserva patty though :)

I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.

FOOD - 4 Stars
I was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.

After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.

I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.

Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  

See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.

Will I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels.

If anyone has ever seen the Korean drama Coffee Prince, then you'll really enjoy Serenade. Everything about this place reminds you of a coffee shop in Korea from the atmosphere to the employees, minus the fact that you're in a dry, hot desert.The place itself is very cute with a tiny stage (I'm assuming they have live music) at a corner and the coffee area at another. There are seats outside also if it ever gets crowded. I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was actually quite empty. I was greeted by 2 male baristas (very good looking might I add) and they were very patient in answering my questions. I'm definitely not an expert on coffee so I went with a iced green tea latte. I noticed that their menu included some dessert items (cakes, waffle), teas, juice/smoothies, and also bingsu aka Korean shaved ice so I'll definitely be back for those. The barista seemed very knowledgeable in preparing my green tea latte (I think). No chunks of powder or anything (ahem like Starbucks) and the matcha taste was very strong. The price was about $4.50 which is a little high but I would pay that for the atmosphere. Overall, this is a great place to come by and hang out with friends or even bring a date. They open until 2am in the morning for those who are still up and need a caffeine fix.

So, I've been on a bit of a hiatus from yelping for the last two weeks or so, but with good reason... I delivered my incredible baby boy at this hospital and I've since been getting into the routine of being a mommy.

My experience with labor and delivery at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea was top notch.  Everyone from the administrative people who I checked in with, to all of the doctors and nurses were amazing.  I went through 3 shifts of nurses during my labor/delivery, and they were fabulous!  My anesthesiologist was incredible too - thank goodness for that epidural!  And best of all, my OB/GYN was there for my actual delivery.  

Once Mav made his appearance, we stayed at the hospital another 48 hours or so, and all of the hospital staff we dealt with there were wonderful as well.  

One thing to note is that this hospital does not have a nursery.  Once your baby arrives, you are in the same room as the baby... nurses are there to help, but you can't just "send the baby to the nursery," as I hear you can do at other hospitals.  I was sleep deprived, but I didn't mind this as I was able to bond with Maverick right away.

Other perks that I was impressed with were the size of the rooms, the fact that everything appeared clean and sanitized, the "room service" from the hospital cafeteria, the snacks available to patients, the videos available to help prepare you for being a parent, etc... but again, I cannot stress enough how impressed I was with the nurses.  Special kudos to Pam for getting me started and visiting after the baby came, Maggie for coaching me through the pushing, Cassie for her integral help post delivery, and all of the rest of the staff who I can't mention by name because I was in a drugged / hormonal state during my stay at this hospital.

I'm not a huge fan of hospitals in general, but again, I had a fabulous experience here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hospital to anyone.

Located between Binions and the Golden Nugget on four blocks of downtown Las Vegas is one of best marketing efforts this part of town has enjoyed in decades ... the Fremont Street Experience.

Fremont Street is covered in a long canopy called Viva Vision with 12 million lights and 550,000 watts of sound entertaining tourists with short free light and music shows every evening on the hour.

Current Schedule (Changes regularly)
  7:00 pm: American Freedom 2 (Fri/Sat. only)
  8:00 pm: Heart - Crazy on Vegas
  9:00 pm: Bon Jovi - Wanted in Vegas
10:00 pm: The Who - Miles over Vegas
11:00 pm: The Doors - Strange Days
12:00 am: JVH - Signs of Life
  1:00 am: A Tribute to Queen (Fri/Sat. only)

Along Fremont Street, you'll find 10 classic (old) casinos with dozens of restaurants and lots of cheap gambling opportunities compared to most casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. This historic street is where gaming began in Nevada in 1931 besides being the first paved street in the city or first street with a traffic light.

The Fremont Street Experience began in 1995 with the closure of the street to form a 7-block outdoor mall. It was obviously enhanced with Viva Vision 10 years ago.  What's next? Who knows .. a holographic Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Frank Sinatra trio?

When you bore of the fun options on the LV Strip, simply want to enjoy some free entertainment, or need to find a casino with lower minimum tables and slot machines, then Fremont Street Experience is waiting in historic downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.

Close to work, I am so pleased that Presto Cafe has opened a Henderson location at Stephanie and the 215, offering their healthy options on this side of town.  If you've never been to the Presto in Southwest Vegas, you probably don't know that PC offers up breakfast, sandwiches, coffee, smoothies, juices, salads, and pides (Turkish flatbread, pronounced 'pee-day').  There are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free items on the menu, something for everyone.  I met Shirley B. here for a late lunch and we both had sandwiches, turkey for me and the vegetarian for her, plus she had their beet salad.  Both sandwiches were a nice size, easily big enough to have one half now and the other half later; that's what Shirley did, but I was piggish and ate the whole thing there.  Consisting of turkey, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mayo on a toasted cranberry walnut bread, PC's turkey sandwich is an especially hearty and tasty version of an item that tends to be boring at most places. 

Located in the same shopping plaza as Gold's Gym, I'm sure the fitness fanatics are happy that PC is here, too.  It's also right next door to Gimme Some Sugar, so if you want to be fit first, then a little fat later, you can kill two birds with one stone.  

Open from 8:00am-8:00pm daily.

Many fine dining restaurants in Vegas resorts seem to be having recession specials right now, so we decided to take advantage of a $39 prix fixe menu L'Atelier is offering. We found out that they stop serving this particular pre-theater menu at 6:45pm. We were running late, and got in closer to 7pm, but the chef still accommodated us. 

The three course meal was served bento box style, with even the dessert on the plate. I can see how this is a convenient wham, bam, thank you ma'am option for people rushing to catch a Vegas show. 

I ordered the king crab and cous cous appetizer, osso buco entree and peach panna cotta dessert. While everything was tasty, portions were definitely on the small side, and nothing that blew me away. It wasn't the quality you'd expect from a Joel Robuchon restaurant. 

Service was pretty mediocre as well. Just because L'Atelier is the more affordable and trendy alternative to its sister restaurant, it doesn't mean it shouldn't put out excellent food and service too.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

DeeDee went in for her 100,000 mile checkup and shot's update today:)

She's 14  1/2 years old which (according to Dr. Bracken) equates to roughly 100 years old in human terms!

It's fairly rare for chowchows to live that long, although I have been extraordinarily fortunate to have both my chows live to a very ripe old age (Sam, my big chow made it to 16  1/2...I still miss him! :-)

I frankly credit most of that good fortune to Dr. Bracken and the wonderful people at Arcadia Animal Clinic...I have had many pets over the years and used many vet's in Portland and San Francisco...they were all good, all came highly recommended by trusted friends, co-workers and the like...but none of them measure up to Arcadia Animal Clinic!

We were looking for a vet after we had been in Arizona for few months and started asking around...more than  1/2 the people we asked mentioned Dr. Bracken as the best they'd met and highly recommended AAC...The beautiful Carin and I looked at each other and said "this can't be a coincidence...6 people that don't even know each other recommend this place...let's go see him!" 

And we did:)

Chow's aren't noted for either their patience or their warm and inviting demeanor...they are a little bit aloof and intimidating...I like that in a dog...both Sam and Dee are coal black, and with their black fur, black tongues, black eyes and gleaming white teeth and fangs, when they smile at you, it can look a little sinister:-)

But they aren't...they are teddy bears and Dr. Bracken and the staff at AAC took the time to understand that (they approach each pet as an individual and get to really know that animal:)

That was apparent at the first meeting of my dogs and Dr. Bracken, when he got down on the floor with them and they talked and played and became great friends (my dogs always love going to AAC...they love Dr. Bracken:)

All that personal rapport with my pup's is and has been critical...not necessarily when they are just in for a checkup or a shots update...but when DeeDee tore her ACL trying to chase a bunny or when she had a minor stroke last year...or when Sammy was finally just too tired to go on and they helped him over with respect and dignity...sorry...I can't see though the tears right now...

AAC is the best veterinary clinic I've found and Dr. Bracken is the best vet I've ever met!

Review Noir

It was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.

I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black "Kill Your Television" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.

She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.

I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.

Not "a go go" I repeat, not "a go go." That would just be disrespectful to this little gem in the rough.

No, it's not fancy. No, their dishes don't match. And no, you won't have to take out a second mortgage to eat breakfast or lunch here. Good food is what I'm all about and this place hits the nail on the head. 

When in doubt, just go to Hash House (how many times do I have to tell you it's not a go go?). Sometimes you just need a little hash in your life. This place hashes like a professional hasher. Awesome flavor, great texture, and more importantly it feels like your getting a home cooked meal. Hash House is everything a chain restaurant isn't, which is why I like it so much. If you're looking for a basic breakfast they do that exceptionally well. Want something a little fancier like a Monty Cristo? Yep. They do that well. Personally, I'm more of a pancake and egg kind of fella. Mary, the owner, was featured for her pancakes on The Cooking Channel, so she has street cred. I can vouch for those tasty hot cakes, they're off the hook. 

Their homemade jams are superb. Generally 10+ choices and usually a few unique flavors. 

Hash House is definitely a "regulars" joint. Become one, you won't regret it.

Thbbbbb. Thumbs down. It's places like this that give Scottsdale a bad name.  I must divulge that I'm not basing this rating on an actual review of the club, because they never let me and my friend in. The door man readily let all of our female friends in, and stopped us. The men in my group were a minority, two men with six ladies. The ladies in the front of our group entered with their momentum, and the last two stayed with us. A steady stream of flesh baring ladies entered one after the other beside us. We explained that we were with a group (admittedly, trying to work the fact that we were with women to our advantage) and the velvet rope boy demeaningly stated that "every guy out here is with 'lots of women.'" I never want to use my girlfriends as currency!

We went next door, all of our girlfriends left Narcisse and joined us, and I'll never go back!

Ugh! Totally gross. I just moved to town and this place appears to epitomise all of the materialistic things about which I'd been forewarned regarding Snottsdale.

What do you expect with a bar called "Narcisse"?

I'll add: in the 1/2 hr or so my girlfriends were in the bar, two of them were groped by "manthers", referred to in Connie's post below.

Have fun!

Incidentally, being new to town, I am looking for pubs/clubs in greater Scottsdale and Phoenix where humans can go, with their friends. Suggestions?

Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!

Priced at $13.50 I had the "Margherita DOC" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!

Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!

If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. 

I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. 
The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. 

Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites. 
Inside the Paris Hotel.

A welcome addition to the ramen scene on the east side of town.  Located in an inconspicuous strip mall at the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, this is a true neighborhood ramen joint where one is always greeted enthusiastically at the door and local Japanese residents can always be spotted as regulars.  The decor is minimalist but modern and service is prompt and non-overbearing.  

Appetizers that stand out are the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the gyoza (pork/chicken pot stickers).  The chicken is served fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior with a hint of ginger accentuated with a squeeze of fresh lemon whereas the gyoza have a nice char and the dough skin and filling are light enough to leave room for the main course.  

After consuming 15+ bowls of ramen on multiple lunch break visits from work, the key words describing the soups here are consistency and balance.  Whereas I've had a few instances at Ramen Sora and Monta where the soups were either too salty or too bitter (black garlic oil was literally blackened garlic),  the broths here all have a creamy rich depth of flavor and are not overly cloying in the mouth so the resistance to reaching for additional spoonfuls of broth once the noodles are finished is quite low.  Noodles come in thick and thin varieties with decent texture although lacking any true inherent flavor only found at the top joints.  

The standout broth for me is one of the relative newcomers on the menu: the kogashi (or burnt miso) ramen.  I've waxed poetic before on the Mallard reaction in chemistry  applied to food in a previous review(nerd alert!) but here again is yet another example of the magical powers of applying heat to rearrange amino acids and simple sugars to create a new unique flavor.  By charring miso paste, not only is there an intense aroma given off by the broth upon arriving at your table, but the flavor profile retains the savory note of the fermented soybeans we all know and love in miso but also has additional complex notes with an almost caramelized sweetness and a hint of bitterness that is pleasing on the tongue.  The crispy fried onions topping the noodles further enhance the umami tsunami.   I wish I could comment on the tan-tan men (spicy Szechuan style broth), but alas my first experience was on a full stomach from a previous meal so I must defer one to read other fellow yelper's raves on this other unique offering.

For the most part, the choices here are safe and reliably consistent, much like dating the girl next door, but if you're in the mood for something a little more adventuresome and unpredictable, the krazy kogashi ramen or the spicy and fiery tan tan men are worthy "fuku-mi-mi" one night stands (had to do it,  the name of the joint is just begging for a little humorous acknowledgment!)  

P.S.  Don't forget to partake in their generous punch-card system where one is entitled to a free order of gyoza or karaage with every fourth bowl of ramen purchased!

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Fresh-prepared food like a Pasta counter, Salad station, and custom Crepes 
 - Mounds of Crab Legs and Shrimp
 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

This new Thai restaurant replaced the Mega Ramen restaurant that was there before, and I do believe this is an improvement!  The inside is much more open and finely decorated.  The service was experienced, nice, and attentive.  The server obviously cared what I thought about the food, which is always a good sign.  I ordered the fried calamari and the Pad Ga Pow (might be spelled differently on the menu) with beef.  Interestingly enough they do not serve pork here!  

The calamari was quite nice.  It came with about half tempura squid and half tempura veggies.  If you can forgive the veggies and don't mind eating a little healthier, I would recommend this dish.  The batter was very, very light perhaps one of the lightest I have had, but had enough flavor to keep it interesting.  They use the typical Thai style sweet and sour sauce, clear and pinkish red in color, not too sweet, and with light tasting chili flakes.  

The Ga Pow was very unique and surprising.  I haven't had this dish prepared in this style before.  The waitress informed me that it is more of a Southern style Thai restaurant.  The meat was very lean and finely minced.  At first I thought it was hamburger by the look, but I was definitely mistaken when I tasted it.  It was very light and almost fluffy.  No feeling of extra grease or fat.  The veggies (onions, bell peppers, etc) were well prepared and fresh tasting.  On top of jasmine rice, it was a very light version of the dish.  One thing to note here is that this place is quite a bit hotter than most Thai restaurants.  The waitress warned me that my 3/5 was VERY hot.  The spice level did not disappoint, and I quite enjoyed the heat level balanced with the lighter flavors.  The dish was not sweet at all, which deviates from the typical version of this dish you find in Vegas.  Very light on the palate and the stomach.  The one criticism I might have is that it also wasn't very complex (no or very little basil, mint, etc), but as simple as the flavors were they worked very well.  

I am very curious about the style of this Thai cooking.  I most certainly will be back to try some of the other dishes like the curries and noodle dishes.  Their motto is no sweetness, and I like that in a Thai restaurant.  Sakina is a fantastic and unique addition to the Thai food scene in Las Vegas, and in my opinion a must try for Thai food lovers!

"Hello Melika. I'd like pay the minimum on our cable bill please."
"OK sir. I would be happy to assist you with this today. May I please have your PIN."
"I have no idea what our PIN is. I"m sorry. What other information may I give you."
"The social security number for the primary customer."
"Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..."
"Yes sir, well I do understand that you have that information, I will not be able to assist you."
"OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money."
"Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment."
"Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us."
"Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day."
Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

The force is strong up in here! This place is dope. It is light years ahead of the place that rhymes with FART DUCKS. (Well, kinda rhymes) You know why? 

Simple: They have Almond Milk. Why that other place doesn't have that as an option yet is beyond me. Galaxy has it and can use it to make some of the specialty drinks instead of dairy. Their brewed coffee is stellar in my book.

Galaxy also has $.50 refills on brewed coffee and Iced coffee drinks. That means while I'm killing it at Miss Pac Man and  sucking down my first Sugar Free Hazelnut Mocha Iced Coffee with a splash of Almond Milk (I'm all about the dark side when it comes to my brew) the kind barista is preparing my second one for the road! Insert Star Wars band playing with the cool blue Elephant dude right here. The Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes in case you were wondering.

If you are keeping track they have: Almond Milk, great Sugar Free syrup collection, cheap refills AND video games now add Drive-thru to the list! My friends have tried their breakfast sandwiches and bagels and enjoyed them, but I can't tell ya personally about those. You know what else they have?

A huge selection of everything Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes and anything else Outer Space related. What this means is that I drink my morning brew with mutha truckin Yoda and an Ewok so BOO YA. Bonus is if you check in on Yelp you get 20% off orders over $5! This is cool because they are a tad bit pricey, but the atmosphere and intergalactic vibe make it worth it to me. I'm just glad this Galaxy isn't far far away.

This Jedi is not using mind tricks on you. Galaxy Cafe is where it's at.

While in Las Vegas, you walk up to the craps table and you got the pass and the don't pass line. Well for me, Earl of Sandwich was definitely a "pass". 

I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional "bite". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading. 

It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for $6, you can't beat a quick bite on the strip and head back to the craps tables!

It is with pleasure that I bestow upon Marcellino Ristorante my coveted 5 star review                                                                                             
                       
                                    *  *  * FANFARE *  *  *             
     
Where do I begin?  How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.

We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.

After that we shared 2 entrees:

The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.

Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  

We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.

Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti "I Sodi", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana "Colle Del Re" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.

Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants.

The Showroom is located at 951 Wigwam Pkwy Henderson, NV. That's just off of 215 and the Gibson exit. Its kinda hard to find if you're not paying attention.

The showroom is really well setup and they have rocks and more rocks. flagstone, stones, gravel, soils and just about any landscape design info you could need. Way better than big box stores as they're locally owned and know the desert landscape and the best options.

Plus you can go to their website and see lots of rock examples and measuring tech info. Also they have a sister company that is Nevada outdoor Living with BBQ island and equipment, higher end patio furniture, waterfalls, statues, fire pits and more.
 
Prices seem high on the patio items and BBQ options but they mostly high end quality stuff that costs a little more. We got a deal on a small set and were happy. The rock options for the yard are still in the making but the prices are right and they deliver.

Staff was friendly and very helpful.

You will get a bunch of good ideas for your landscape dreams. Go in and check it out.

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

So if you feel like this is a place you would like to try out after reading this, by all means take your chances.

A true diamond in the rough when it comes to Korean food options in Las Vegas.  Korean barbeque and tofu stew joints are aplenty in Spring Mountain, but E-Jo is one of those niche restaurants that specializes in slow cooked beef soups which  one rarely comes across unless you're in a city with a full-fledged Koreatown.
  
Don't be fooled by their limited menu offerings and the simplicity of their banchan since the old saying goes that it is far better to do a few things well than to do many things poorly.  They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   
Sea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  

Accompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.

A true mom/pop joint devoid of pretense that delivers homecooked Korean goodness to nourish the body and soul.

***Inexpensive tables in a not-too-shabby casino; South Point also features the popular middle-of-the-country burger chain Steak & Shake***

South Point is a lower priced hotel and casino near the Las Vegas Strip (a lot closer to Vegas than Stateline or Whiskey Pete's).  The casino features a wide variety of gaming and had several restaurants on-site.  I saw a lot of advertising for Steak & Shake on the drive in and maybe because of that, the restaurant had a very long line.  This is the furthest west I've seen a Steak & Shake (I thought they came only as west as Texas).

The gaming tables are low with $3 minimum bets, but they dispense mostly $5 chips.  Still, your money can go longer here (and I was fortunate enough to win here on this trip).  For a Saturday afternoon, the casino had a good number of customers, but it was not too crowded.  Because of the smaller crowd, the smokiness of the casino was not too bad.

The staff was pleasant.  And maybe somewhat surprising (to me at least) was that the cocktail waitresses (at least on this visit) seemed more attractive than the ones I saw at the big Strip casinos that same weekend.

South Point is a good last gambling stop before heading back to Los Angeles.  For non-gaming Vegas activities, you are probably not going to find much of that here.  For food, I am not familiar with a lot of the options (they may just be bad hotel restaurants) so you should probably try Steak & Shake first.  Good or bad, it will give you an opportunity to try a steakburger chain that is popular in the Midwest.

A large parking lot and a large structure are adjacent to the casino (free parking).

Acrobatics, singing, comedy, incredible costumes, dancing, lots of sexual innuendos, men with rock hard abs and women's boobies. Lots and lots of women's bobbies. Yup, this shows got something for every adult out there. 

Before you call me a perv, my wife is the one who picked out what show we were going to see while in Vegas, so call her the perv. 

Like I stated above, Zumanity has something for everyone. Contrary to what you may have heard, Zumanity is not all about sex. 

Well, it actually is but not in a pornographic way. It's sexy, sensual, seductive and most importantly, tastefully done. The choreographer of Zumanity did an amazing job at making sure this show is as steamy and racy as possible without crossing any major lines. Of course there were a few folks in the sold out arena who were not prepared for what they witnessed and actually left during the performance but for the most part, the crowd was really into what was taking place on the gorgeous stage. 

Some of the highlights of Zumanity are these two incredibly beautiful woman swimming in a fish bowl, a very attractive red headed girl doing amazing things with silver hula hoops, two super sexy dudes battling it out for a woman's affection only to fall for each other during the brawl and of course all the crowd interactions. 

I couldn't believe the things the two hilarious MC's would get the audience to partake in. They took two random people from the audience and pretty much made them dry hump each other on stage while their significant others watched from their seats. HILARIOUS. 

If you're the type of person who gets uncomfortable in risque situations than this show is definitely not for you. If you're into risque situations, dirty jokes, intimate, steamy scenes, sexy men with rock hard abs and stunning woman with their breasts hanging out for the world to see, than Zumanity is a MUST SEE. If you look hard enough on the web, you can get good seats for reasonable prices.

Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.

I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! 

Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I can

This place is pretty fantastic. I actually felt like I was in a real life city when I was sitting here the other day on my laptop looking out the window. I sorely miss living in a real life city, specifically Boston, so places like this make me super happy. 

Staff are really cool and helpful. Its spacious and clean, and I don't feel like everyone in the place can see my screen, not that there is anything weird on there... okay there probably is, but bottom line is no one else is staring over my shoulder making me feel self conscious about shit I enjoy looking at on the internet. 

The coffee is delicious and strong. Nothing worse than a weak cup'o joe. I had a pot of their Orange Detox also, which wasn't terrible, but I could tell they used tap water.. I loathe tap water and can immediately tell a difference because I think the tap here tastes absolutely fucking disgusting. I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night. 

O'well.

Another thing I liked about this place is that there aren't 500 hipsters or emo-assholes sitting around looking depressed.. maybe I was lucky that day because it wasn't very crowded at all. So yeah, I dug Lola, and the prices are CHEAP. Thankfully this is yet another groovy coffee shop in the valley that is there to help me avoid the Corporate Whore that is Starbucks.

Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm "snap" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

I am obsessed with this place.  I am so glad they are about 25 miles away from my home, otherwise I would be there every weekend.  The wait is a little long once you hit 8 am., however I am "lucky" the twins wake up at 5:30am everyday.  After getting ready and gathering everything we needed we headed out.  We made it just after 7:30 am.  The only sad thing I realized this time is that the balloon twister person does not arrive until 9:00am.  Oh, well.  I am here for the food really.  I almost had a repeat of the first visit, but I decided to try a different pancake this time.  You can make any kind of combos.  So I decided for the Chilaquiles benny and the sweet potato pancakes.  I am torn, I think I almost liked the sweet potato pancake better that the pineapple upside down cake one.  I guess I have to go again to make sure.  The chilaquiles benny were so perfect.  Instead of an english muffin is a tortilla base round, so yummy, with a layer of pulled beef barbacoa, topped with a perfectly poached egg then draped with this creamy spicy sauce.  Sooooo good.  The kids had pancakes and my hubby had a breakfast taco plus the chilaquiles benny.  This time I also enjoyed the blackberry mimosa and the hubby had the am margarita, which was so strong he couldn't finish it.

OTFM was a zoo today (in a good way).  I've never seen it so packed with people, but it's refreshing to see that so many people are looking to buy local lately!  I was lucky enough to get one of ten seats for the kick-off of The Farm Sessions... what a treat.

For those that don't know, The Farm Sessions will take place each week at the Farmers Market from now through the end of the season (May 29, 2010).  Each Saturday, a local chef will demonstrate (to a group of ten people), as they shop the farmers market and prepare a dish using fresh ingredients.  Viking is the main sponsor, and I believe the space itself is there thanks to the Chef's Loft as well.  But The Farm Sessions' concept is thanks to Joe Garcia, who brought his vision to fruition - kudos for that!

Today's session was led by Chef James Porter of Petite Maision.  He did an incredible job, keeping the session fun and interactive.  I learned a ton and I scored one of the eco-friendly totes as well.  Chef James made it look easy to create a gourmet meal of pork chop with salad and goat cheese and a fresh melon drizzled with honey and goat cheese for dessert.  

Our group of foodies followed James around the market and found the ingredients from the following vendors:
-Made By Bees
-Triple V Farm
-Rhiba Farms
-On the Vine
-Seacat Gardens
-Queen Creek Olive Mill
-Pork on a Fork

While today was free since it was the first one, going forward, the cost will be $40 per ticket and participants will receive enough ingredients to prepare the same dish at home for two, a recipe card, shopping/resource list and a market shopping tote.

I am excited to see the line-up of chefs that are participating for future sessions - I am sure this will sell out each week, so plan on purchasing your tickets early!  (You can do so on their website).

Swankified and fun atmosphere, especially when you have DJ's like Afrojack and David Guetta in the house! This is a nightclub that seriously knows how to party.

Guide to having a good time at XS:

1. Go on a night with topnotch DJ's whose music you can groove to for many hours.

2. Get a VIP table + bottle service if you can fork up the money. IT'S WORTH IT.

3. Look around. Lots of interesting/strange characters!

4. Dance. Laugh. Have a good time.

The layout at XS is great because you get a great view of the DJ from almost every angle. The outdoor area features a pool where crazy antics take place. There is minimal seating for the general public -- gotta stand if you don't pay up. If you're okay on your feet for hours you'll be fine, but ladies know it is SO worth it to have a table. Not to mention service from the hostesses is excellent and they're also pretty cute.

My favorite part of the night was dancing up on the cushions of our booth seats (happy feet!). It was comfy as well as an awesome vantage point. We could see: 1) all the oddly dressed and/or super drunk people around us and 2) AFROJACK+GUETTA as they dropped those beats!

DATE TIP (Gentlemen): Make a note of the paragraph above regarding seating. The ladies will love you if you have a table. Or at least visit you to rest their feet. ;)

DATE TIP (Ladies): Cushion dancing is awesome, but at an elevated height one is much more prone to creative pickup lines. A small price to pay for the view you get!

We ended up at the airport with a few hours to kill, and wanted to have a decent meal at a sitdown restaurant, versus a fast-paced sandwich shop.  We were in the C Terminal, and Zinc looked like the best option.  The menu was pricey, but that wasn't completely surprising being in an airport and our expectations of the food quality.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The French onion soup was a good version, but for $14 it needed to be better than just good.  And that was the highlight of the meal.  The steak frites were a complete let down.  It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare.  I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none.  And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew.  The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless.  The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak.  I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal.

I would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed.  Just plan on eating somewhere else first, and maybe hitting Zinc for a couple of cocktails and skipping the food.

Purchased this at the Paris buffet counter for $54 and some odd cents. The lady put the wrist band on for me so I couldn't keep it loose to take off when I sleep/take pictures (it's pretty bulky). You can't cut lines with the average ticket, but it's a real wallet saver! My cousin and I tried going to all of them, but after stumbling across Flavors at Harrah's, we decided to skip it and go back to Paris for our last meal. Here was our plan of attack:
8 Dinner: Le Village (waited an hour on a Wednesday) 
10 Dessert: Spice Market (couldn't resist the savory stuff though!)
8 AM Breakfast: Paradise Garden (took us an hour to figure out the buses to get there)
1 PM Lunch: Carnival Buffet (at this point food was starting to sound unappetizing... And I'm a buffet beast) 
5 PM Dinner at our favorite buffet (which will be Le Village. We want to go at 5 to not have to wait in line as long, but I'm not sure I'll be able to eat again in 2 hours!)

My biggest recommendation: by your pass for a late dinner and choose a buffet as a "snack" (tea time, dessert, elevenses, whatever you wish!) so you don't overload at all of them and still feel you got to go to them all. Also, these places can't fail a breakfast, so for buffets that have poor reviews (thinking flavors and paradise), go their in the morning to get made-to-order omelets, Crepes/pastries, waffles, etc. Good luck eating, I hope you enjoy it!

It was late and I was doing some early Christmas shopping in west Chandler and I stumbled upon Zos Kitchen. I decided to run in and grab something. 

But when I got back to my office after my pickup, I was really impressed. I've heard so many good stories, so I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to the hype. 

For my first try, I went with their Steak Stack for $7.59 with a Hummus 5oz side for $0.79(see photos). The damage came to $9.06 including taxes, which seemed pretty good for everything. 

What I wasn't prepared for was the tastiness of their bread. Don't get me wrong, everything was really very good. In fact, if they had used any commercial bread, this still would be a Four Star review. But the flavor of their rosemary bread was incredible. I would have paid $9.06 for a loaf of it. It was delicious! 

So, go enjoy, Zos Kitchen!  I will definitely be back.

Anyone who knows me, knows how much I'm a sucker for burgers. Ever since I moved to Vegas I've been on the hunt for a great burger joint. Holsteins comes very close to hitting the mark. I've tried about 4 different burgers from here (Rising Sun, Gold Standard) but I must say the Nomnom Burger & Billionaire Burger were my favorite. So tender and tasty. Now that's a burger! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. So the fries, meh. I could do without those. Funny, it seems difficult to find a place that has great burgers AND fries. I mean come on, you can't really enjoy one without the other. Am I right? Before my visit, I scrolled through some pictures on yelp I noticed the thick cut fries. Mama like! Imagine my disappointment to hear they no longer have those on the menu, boo! Anywho, the onion rings are good and the shakes are pretty standard. Order a bamboozled shake if you need a little "pick me up" Hey, it's happy hour somewhere. :) The service has always been great, even with larger parties. So bring your friends, appetite and don't forget your wallet! These burgers are not for the frugal foodie.

Main ingredient, oh how your deliciousness overfloweth, and your food ain't bad either!

After getting suckered into a lunch with the guys from work, we flipped a coin and ended up aimed from The Main Ingredient. Let me tell you, there are worse places to end up for lunch. I wasn't sure how, but the coin was flipped between, Main Ingredient, Cartel, AND Upper Crust. I didn't realize there were 3 sides to a coin before, but apparently there is. 

I was torn between the Mac & Cheese and the the Red Goat. After some convincing my buddies and the waitress helped me land on the Mac & Cheese. Although, you can't really compare apples to apples here, being that the Red Goat is a salad and the Mac & Cheese is; well, Mac & Cheese, I really was torn. Let me tell you now, this was the beginning of the end for me, and I haven't looked back since. After that first bite I made an executive decision; I would be taking a vacation from my normal diet. Don't worry diet, we'll get back together someday soon, just not today and likely not tomorrow either.

The Mac & Cheese here was like a lasagne of good ol' hometown delicious cheesy goodness, expecting to see a piled scoop of cheesy noodles, I was pleasantly surprised! Cooked with loads of cheddar cheese and topped with green chile, this was pure Mac & Cheese bliss.

In real downtown Phoenix fashion, Main Ingredient is tucked into a renovated home, redone to give that home / cafe feel. Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note, ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in. Better for you than butter and in my opinion better tasting, and it adds a little European charm. 

Here's hoping your next coin flip ends all you up at Main Ingredient. Happy Dining Yelpers!

Was in the Hendertucky area so I gotta take advantage of one of my bookmarks and it definitely did not disappoint!

I was greeted by a nice lady as soon as I came in. I told her that I was a first timer and that  I was gonna need a few minutes. She smiled and said there was no rush. Right away I felt comfortable being there.

While looking over all the wonderful creations they made, she explained to me that the items on the left side were refrigerated and needed to be consumed right away or put in a fridge if you are going home at once. The ones on the right can be stored at room temperature.

So I went with the Cannoli and the Blueberry Crumb Cake. I havnt had a good Cannoli in a while and it was a supposed refrigerated item so down the pipe it went. The Blueberry Crumb Cake was gone as soon as I brought it home. Both were delicious and the family was wondering why I didn't get more than I should.

Overall, I liked what I saw and ate. Some negative things to mention would be that the parking is limited to the street and just the fact that its kind of drive to Hendertucky coming from North Las Vegas. If you are in the area, it's a nice stop for you sugar addicts.

Easy parking in the big lot, fast seating, & super friendly service started this experience off with all my fave things. 

And then the FOOD happened, & it was all over:

Steak & Eggs - I chose their oniony, garlicky garlic fried rice instead of potatoes - SO GOOD with my poached & runny eggs.  The steak was perfectly rare, & my side of hollandaise made me happy.  AND - I upgraded the plain pancakes that came with to:

Red Velvet pancakes - not the best textured pancake bc it was a little on the dry or overdone side, but the chocolate shavings & fresh whipped cream & cream cheese-y syrup that came with it made each bite yummy!  The small stacks are two small pancakes, which are the perfect size to try them yet not stuff yourself silly.

Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs - I had a bite of this & it was damn good!  The crispy battered steak & the gravy were really good.  Hash browns were kindof basic, but the upgrade to these were SO good:

Banana Cream Pie pancakes - another short stack of two perfectly textured, light & fluffy little pancakes, topped with vanilla pudding, sliced fresh bananas, & fresh whipped cream.  These were THE BEST!! 

Their selection of unique kalua pork menu items (grilled cheese & benedict) as well as fried rice rolled into an omelette make me wonder why these guys don't come to LA!!

This is one of the best breakfast places I've been to.  Definitely a must if you're in the area!!

Decided to take a Staycation with The Better Half and saw that the rates for the new HRH Tower at the Hard Rock was $90 per night.....sold!  We booked it online and headed down to get away for a couple of days.  Here are some highlights of our stay:

- The tower is new and has a ton of room in the suites.  There's a separate bedroom & living room, very spacious.  (see pics)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=IBebLmeBXfFVUzg5ybHSEA
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=NgMh_-U4F58muEyYbyVJjg

- The beds are very comfortable.  The pillow top mattress is soooo soft we melted into the bed.  We didn't want to wake up in the morning....LOL

- There is a $15 per day resort fee.  For that you get access to the spa among other amenities.

- The bathroom is huge!  Large, deep tubs.......large shower with rainfall shower head.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=QRXtpTSeupCvCrnahXg07w
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oakaMw79ChXM8NllHjgLNg?select=RhCKWzs4vQXFtBUv1vE0bg

- The mini-bar is motion activated.....which means if you take something from it, if it's gone for more than 2 minutes it will automatically be charged to your room.....be careful not to remove anything unless you really want it!

- The toiletries were awesome.  Soaps & shampoo were good quality.

- The lobby of the new HRH Tower has a ton of new memorabilia in it....worth checking it out.

Some QUICK TIPS:
- Parking for the HRH Tower is on the south side of the building.  Park at the parking garage or valet which is off of Harmon.  If you go to the other parking area, it's far from the new tower.

- You get $10 in FREE Slot Play when you check into the hotel.....use it, it's FREE money.  The Better Half redeemed it but didn't win anything.

Overall, we had a great time at the Hard Rock.  A nice little staycation in our favorite city!

Unless I'm in Vegas, I don't do buffets. So you should take my 4 star review for a buffet like it's an 8 star review from someone who normally goes to buffets. Like I said, I don't do buffets outside of Vegas, but when another food obsessed friend who also doesn't eat at buffets begged and pleaded with me to check out Jasmine Tokyo, I knew something was up. I opened my Yelp app, read the many positive reviews, and saw they even had a Check-In offer for $5 off. Sold!

Jasmine Tokyo is located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, where the old Claim Jumper used to be. It's $20 for dinner and I believe $12 for lunch. The Asian calamari, walnut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, chicken skewers, and beef dishes were some of my favorites. They were all seriously awesome and I went back up to refill my plate at least twice. Also very good were the many varieties of sushi (they even offered sashimi!). 

For desert they offered a variety of cakes, such as chocolate, german chocolate, cheesecake, and I think lemon. They also had vanilla, chocolate, and rice puddings. Cookies, fresh fruit, jello and more!

I chowed down at Jasmine Tokyo and I am looking forward to my next visit! I didn't get to try the crab legs, Mongolian stir fry, and some of the other beef and seafood options, but I feel I had my share and left very satisfied. Check it out, even if you are anti-buffet like me.

I woke from my Venetian slumber hungry and thought where can I get a good AM meal that will not leave me wanting throught the rest of the day. So I Yelped and  the Omlet House was the first to pop up on the radar that wasn't a new kid on the block.  

If this were a truck stop the economy would seriously slow down to a crawl.

This is the real deal. A local big boy breakfast establishment that has been dishing out the goods for almost 35 years.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#6zAZ_w1PQ4sThfUhAH2ZLA

This is my kind of family run mom & pop shop.  You walk in through its unassuming doors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#xOGflmieBbw7Abik8tQnHA to find a mega country kitch overload.  But this is just a decoy, the real country goodness is in the menu and on the plate here at the Omelet House. 

With 39 lumberjack sized 6 egg omelets on its menu including the #33 &1/3 Flatlander Special that includes :Raw Liver, Parsnips, Peanut Butter, Organically grown Black Jelly Beans, Sauteed Grunion Lips (2), Gardenia Petals and topped with Mint Ice Cream (Subject to when the Grunion are running.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#EiX9sk-Ft9an7KqO2NRYaQ

In addition to omelets they of course serve large portions of other breakfast and lunch favorites http://www.omelethouse.net/Menus/Charleston%20Omlet%20House%20Lg.pdf  and a great cup of coffee.

A great menu with a sense of humor!  I opted to try the #15 Cowboy Special

FOOD Ordered:
#15 Cowboy Special Omelet, with fresh chips and homemade banana or pumpkin bread.

In Vegas and hungry for some good salt of the earth breakfast food.Your food will not be served on small artsy fartsy plates and it will not be the latest infusion of ten cultures, but what you will get is super huge portions of good food.

Next time in Vegas you bet I'll be back!

Drive-in movie baby! Right on! 


Yeeeeeeeep! Like Dave on Storage Wars! 

This place rocks! The Nostalgic feeling that is like no other! 

I have been here twice so far and it is about time I show some love with a review! 

I have to admit, went here once during the Summer, BAD mistake. Yeah it must have been close to 103 degrees that night. Rather than watching a movie we ended up playing an unplanned session of wet t-shirt contest. I will never forget the echo in my ear's "we need more ice ...and fast...I am dying" 

The first visit was flat out miserable, yet due to a lack of judgment and being the spontaneous type that we are, made for an interesting night in the car! Yeah we were not thinking clearly, hmmm it is 10pm and still 103 in the desert? Uh hello! We are lunatics! 

The second visit was much better as I went during Winter! Yay! We had a blast and truly enjoyed ourselves "watching the movie that is"! lol 

I think I counted four screens so you also have a choice in movies!

The snack shop is awesome, has all of the goodies you would want and need for a fun drive-in snack experience. 

Popcorn, Nathan's hot dogs, tons of ice cream, frozen lemonade, assortment of candies, sodas, etc. 

This is a treat and so glad we have a real drive-in still left! 

Just don't be idiots like us and go when it is hot as hell outside.

It is now over eighteen months since we started coming here.  We have found Sean and his family run business to be great!

I wrote my previous review after waiting six months following a very bad series of incidents at another cleaner -- which has a chain here in AZ.  At this other place, the pockets on my dress shirts started ripping at the inside corners from rough ironing.  The kids who work there weren't of any help to us. Finally the absentee owner finally got involved and gave us a credit on future business for the damage.  

Okay, so much for the history of how we came to Ultra.  

NEVER again will we go to a chain.  Family run businesses care much more about getting it right and pleasing the customer.  Mr. Sean, as we call him and his family have been great to us.  We've used all the services, from comforters, to alterations, dress shirts, suits, you name it.  I'll say it a third time, they're great!

A shout out to Yelp'er Roland W, who when we were searching Yelp for a new place had posted a nice review.  Thank you!

Located on the third floor on restaurant row and a hallway's distance from the newly erected Chelsea, the restaurant was elegant with a cool jazzy swagger to it. Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.  

I decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience. 

Our first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.


Second course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!


Just when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again! 


The final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore! 

From the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.

Bravo Scarpetta!!!

If you are steak lover and visiting Las Vegas you must give this place a try. I had the honor of dining here with several friends. Wow! What more can you ask for as a steak lover. I have to say you are going to be paying a lot for your meat. It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. Hands down the best steak money can buy.

If you are a person who loves great meat and outstanding dishes. What more can you ask for as a steak lover.  It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. If you are from NY and love Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan then you need to long no place else.

I highly recommend the bone in filet to the 8 ounce Kobe steak. If you are looking for great starters I would get pink Fiji peach salad or the butter lettuce. For side dished I would highly creamed spinach and roasted Brussels sprouts. Leave room for desert. The banana cream pie or the baked Alaska pear.

Happy birthday to me!

I celebrated early this year... with a 19 course meal at Binkley's.

Yes... I am serious.  We literally had 19 courses in about 3.5 hours, and it flew by!

I had great company with my husband and our friends from Charlotte.  The staff at Binkley's was totally on it; paying attention to detail with a personalized "Happy Birthday Gabi" on our menus and ridiculous (in a good way) service from Rebecca, our waitress and a handful of supporting cast members.  They were like ninjas, replacing fresh rolled napkins in ribbon, each time any of us got up to use the restroom.

I chose the four course tasting menu and a single glass of wine.  I was the designated driver for the night... go figure!  The other three in our group went with the four and five course meals paired with wine.  Instead of breaking down each person's meal, I'll simply review my own.  Sit back and relax because there is plenty of food to tell you about.  Here goes:

-amuse bouche #1 - sherry scented duck consomme
-amuse bouche #2 - chicken liver mousse served with a rye crostini, whole grain mustard, caper berry, brandy gelee, pickled pear onion, and egg mousse
-amuse bouche #3 - flash frozen fruit cocktail - this was delicious!
-cold appetizer - red king crab (by the way, they brought out the crab alive prior to serving it)... it was served with roasted baby beets, sea beans, shaved fennel, cornbread croutons, sawagani crab, yuzu zabaglione
-amuse bouche #4 - miniature sloppy joe
-amuse bouche #5 - buttermilk bread pudding
-amuse bouche #6 - pommes souffle with seven dipping sauces - mmmmm!
-amuse bouche #7 - basil and chevre mousse, vol-au-vent served with a dehydrated tomato, red pepper coulis, and red pepper powder
-amuse bouche #8 - pomegranate bomb served with mango, ver jus- (another favorite of ours)
-hot appetizer - charred shrimp - black beans, fresno chile, bean sprouts, cilantro, and an orange lentil dahl
-amuse bouche #9 - mint chocolate chip shot with a mint consumme (not may favorite but it was served on an LED light - kind of cool!)
-nantucket bay scallops served with gnocchi, chorizo, corn, avocado, and confit tomato (great choice)
-amuse bouche #10 - bubblegum and lemon passion fruit lollipops
-amuse bouche #11 - strawberry souffle served with a banana creme anglaise
-amuse bouche #12 - vanilla whipped cream with a candied mint leaf - oooh; one of our favorites
-brown sugar polenta - amazing dessert!
(I also sampled the cheese fondue and the cheese plate which were pretty fabulous also)
-amuse bouche # 13, 14, and 15 - pistachio merengues, apricot pate, chocolate brownie with a violet buttercream icing.

We all left more than full and happy, but that didn't stop any of us from taking the homemade candied nuts on the way out.

Binkley's is definitely a unique foodie experience to be cherished for special occasions.  I can't wait to celebrate there again soon!

Those who live by the sword...

We came here last evening around six for quick bite and walked in on a crazy house.  You couldn't tell it by the two other couples eating here.  It was only when we got to the counter and discovered they couldn't stop taking telephone Take-Out orders to take ours. LOL  

We actually didn't wait too long, maybe ninety seconds.  But the phones were ringing off the hook!  China Jade is basically an old style Chinese Take-Out place, doubling as a restaurant.  Gaging by the phones ringing every thirty seconds, there's no need to change their setup.  You don't fix things that aren't broken.

China Jade's weakness isn't the food. It's the hurried service to get back to the phones.  I am not exaggerating this point.  It was almost bye-bye cell phone as they nearly spilt the soup in their rush. And, since China Jade is built for takeout, you'll find a lot of plastic plates and utensils. The soup BTW was served in a  plastic 16 oz "To Go" container (photo).

From our standpoint this is all minor stuff, if the food is good.  Last night the food was very good and just short of Four Stars. 

We had the Hot & Sour Soup (photos), eight Fried Dumplings, Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice and a soft drink; all for just $18 including tax. Nice! 

So, Three and a Half Stars "A-OK" and we'll be back; most likely for Take-Out. LOL

Friends ask: What's your favorite car?

I say: Hands down, super cars!  Who doesn't drool for the exotics?!

Friends go on to tell me that there's a track in which you can drive them as fast as you want, yadda yadda. 

Me: No Brainer! Of course I want in!!
 
If you can't be behind the wheel for whatever reason, hey, you can be a back-seat driver! As I was waiting for my turn I saw a few people riding as a passenger alongside a real race car driver.  I felt their excitement just by looking at their expressions as they got out of the car. They sure got the ride of a lifetime! 

Most of the employees here are a friendly bunch. They know what they are doing and seem to enjoy their jobs. The owner was on duty that day and noticed we were waiting for quite a while, so they offered my friend a free upgrade and tried to move things along as fast as possible. He paid for the regular Ferrari and got to drive the scuderia instead. I notice that they keep adding more and more cars to their garage! How I wished they had a McLaren when I was there!

Okay, okay. I'll leave you all with a cheesy picture. Here's a photo of me in a ridiculous helmet but in a white lambo:

I discovered Mon Ami Gabi Restaurant during my last visit to Vegas. I was so impressed. that during this trip, I made it a point to reserve a spot at this classic French Bistro. I think the family agrees that this was an unforgettable experience. 
A bagged baguette. is placed on the table and our Caesar salads were served. 
We all ordered the Steak Frites
The steaks are listed as "steak" No particular cut. Just steak. Nice tender steak. And the French fries were perfectly done.  
Steaks around the table were, Steak Roquefort, Steak Au Poivre, and Steak Bearnaise.   
With so many steak houses in Vegas it surprised me that,.. in a very French way, this place stands on it's own. The grain-fed Midwest beef is undoubtedly the best beef I've had in a long time. The service is friendly, efficient, and not snooty in any way. 
If you find yourself in Las Vegas make it a point to visit Mon Ami Gabi.
 During the summer months, sit out side, under the misters and watch the water show across the street at the Bellagio. It's a perfect romantic setting.   

Things to remember
No matter how close, a Hotel looks...it's not. It's all an illusion
Cab everywhere
The winter months are frigging cold, take a coat

A twenty dollar sandwich got me a red room upgrade, a sick view of Bellagio Fountains, a roll away bed, and a DAMN good time in Sin City!

Its quite simple actually.  Simply fold a twenty dollar bill in between your credit card and ID and ask if there are any available upgrades.  Obviously a little small talk is in order.  Use your charm and personality, but more importantly don't forget the magic words, "we'll take care of you!" to help seal the deal. 

All you really have to do is ask for what you want and let the sandwich do the rest.  Ask for ridiculous upgrades like a indoor gym, a penthouse suite, or mirrored ceilings.  Anything to make them laugh and break up the monotony of checking in boring tourist after boring tourist.  

After some small talk, you'll see them banging away on their keyboard.  Continue to chat with them and let them know how excited you are about the weekend and that all you want to do is have a good time.  Heck, invite them up to have a drink and let them know that you think they're awesome. TRUST ME...It pays to be nice!

Before you know it they'll show you a picture of the red room and let you know that its typically a $40 upgrade per night but for you its on the house.  If you're really nice and he or she likes you, then they'll probably ask if you need a roll away bed ($30 upgrade) and late check-out too. I took advantage of both, with a total savings for a 2 night stay reaching a whopping $110.  Can I get an Amen!

The TDS (twenty dollar sandwich) will pretty much work at any hotel or club so use it wisely and you'll be livin large baby!

When my sister and I were little, we used to rebel against the very idea of a thrift store. We hated the smell (you know, the one that reminds you of visiting a nursing home) and were horrified by the thought of wearing something someone else had worn.

To this day, I'm still not thrilled by the idea of hand-me-downs from an unidentified stranger. That being said, my husband and I stumbled upon the every other Saturday 50% off sale at the Goodwill on Camelback and have been pretty excited about going back since. We were in this part of Tempe this morning, saw this location, and realized that it was not only a much bigger location than the Camelback one but also that it was again 50% off Saturday. 

We didn't spend long here--there's that smell, after all--but we did come out victorious. For $40, we emerged with two *huge* house plants for $7.50 each, a gorgeous silver pot/vase for $5, 3 sun dresses for me at $3.50 each and a t-shirt for $2.50. Once I wash the clothes with my own detergent, all I'll remember is that I would have paid $100 or so for these items anywhere else. 

If you can get past the physical and psychological barriers to buying used clothing, you might find some really cute and cheap items--and score yourself some deals on home decor items. And, as you can imagine, the foray into used-goods land feels all the more worth it when you go on a 50% off Saturday and get the stuff for even cheaper.

Visiting LV from LA, gf since HS and fellow Yelper took me to this quaint little establishment off the strip. It's not much from the outside, situated in a strip mall, as you walk in it's as if you walk into a little Japan. Inside is contemporary design, with cozy booths and tables. 

Friend and I had the AYCE sushi, of course. Service was spot on, the food just kept coming and coming for a good part of 2 1/2 hours. And was all so wonderful on the palette. I think we ate just about everything on the menu. I have been to several other AYCE sushi establishments and have accepted that "it is what it is"...limited menu items, limited time to eat, and green tea ice cream for dessert. UGH!!!! There was none of that at Sushi Kaya. The AYCE includes a plethora of menu choices; appetizers, soups, noodles, sashimi, of course a wide range of sushi, AND desserts. When I say desserts, I don't mean just green tea ice cream, I mean you've got options. That was really surprising to me and I was very happy to be able to order several different desserts. Thinking back, we weren't rushed out like so many restaurants typically do for the purposes of turnover. Sitting relaxing catching up over AYCE sushi, now that's a day well spent.

When traveling I prefer to go where the locals go, and this is definitely a local place and I will definitely return the next time I'm in LV.

Let me first get one thing out of the way: you don't come here for ambiance, as the restaurant has a very basic look both inside and outside. But if you want really good, authentic Sichuan and Cantonese style cuisine, this is the place to go. You'll find many intriguing dishes listed in the menu and the staff will be more than willing to help you out with the less familiar dishes, but you will definitely be pleased with what you'll get. The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality and quantity of the food you'll get. And remember that if you find the spicy boldness of Sichuan cooking a bit daunting, you can always choose the more delicate and highly flavorful Cantonese dishes.

 Be aware that the entrance to the parking area in the rear is easy to miss. The restaurant entrance itself is at the back of the building, just beside the parking area. And if you don't care to drive, here's good news - especially for the ASU people who would love to have excellent Chinese food at a nearby place and who are on a limited budget: the restaurant is just steps away from the Apache Blvd / Price Rd / 101 station of the light rail, across the street from its park-n-ride, so it's easily accessible! http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Dvh5A3C9EOzil1C6YeJUw/l.jpg

Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.

Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!

Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.

My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.

I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.

I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!

Came here with a group of friends to see The Green perform.. While walking up to BB we saw a huge line of people and got worried but that was just the line for the box office.. If you had already purchased your ticket, you were able to walk straight to the entrance and head up the escalators... 

I really love the space of BB.. You are free to stand and listen to the music, get as close to the stage or as far away as you want, dance with your friends or go outside on the patio and hang out.. At one point one of my GFs and I were too drunk and wanted to sit down so we got a table in the restaurant section.. which BTW from our booth, we had a great view of the stage.. We ordered cheese fries which came out to be over $13 (a bit overpriced IMO) but service was friendly, especially the drink runner, Pons!

I will definitely be coming back to the Brooklyn Bowl and will hopefully be taking advantage of some of the bowling promotions that they do for locals~

HOT TIP: BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE! It's cheaper and gets you in faster...

Why on earth would anyone come to this location?  

I don't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment.  From the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms.  This is a place with kids, most of the them under the age of 12, the bathrooms need to have a regular schedule for cleaning and restocking, especially on the weekends!  Kids in general are messy, but now you have a couple hundred running through a restroom, it needs to be cleaned regularly.

I was so disappointed to see that the staff only appeared for the birthday party and to drop off food, but when I looked around, I only saw one person out sweeping and trying to clean up and the person at the entrance.  Other than that, I would occasionally see a person come from the back and look around and go back to the back..  You have kids running around wildly.  Everyone at work that's not cooking should be out trying to man the restaurant floor.  

Hand sanitizers ran out in the play area, but people working there were waking around doing nothing.

I will return if a kid I know is having a party there, but I won't be eating the food.

Before you read my review, read David B's. It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.

I was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...

The Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. 

The founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.

Most people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.

So, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all.

I am in freaking love with this place. Why didn't I ever come here before the name change? Yep that's right folks. That burger everyone loves so much was on the menu before the attic was the attic. 

Anywho... I came on a Wednesday and sat out on the patio in the beautiful weather Phoenix has a tendency to offer its residence this time of year. I peered over the selection of craft beers for something that shouted at me. Yes. A fine selection of funkwerks brews. I chose the deceit and the saison. And both would receive high markings from me on BA and untappd. I also ordered the Ivan burger and fries as part of the running Wednesday special. The fries were fresh and crispy and well seasoned. I love burgers. Love them almost as much as I love my first born. Especially gourmet, prepared medium, and housed by a pretzel bun. You need a good dense piece of bread to support the weight of such a delectable hunk of beef and apparently the attic knows what's up. This burger really is all the rave. Everyone should try it at least once. Peer pressure! 

I will most certainly be back. Most certainly for the beer and burger on Wednesday. Also don't forget that you're brews are $1.50 off for HH before 6 every weekday. If I wasn't saving myself for AYCE pad Thai I would be on my way there now!

My friend had been talking about this place for a while, so we finally got the chance to meet up for a snow cone. They are located in the back corner of a parking lot, just behind the Shell gas station on Eastern and Sunridge Heights. 

Service was friendly and they offered us up as many samples as we wanted to try before committing to a flavor. I was initially interested in trying the caramel corn flavor but it was a little too sweet for me, so I opted for a fruitier option with grapefruit and added sour spray to make it a little tangier. My friend Sam opted for pear and we were both incredibly pleased with our snowcones. They were a little on the sweet side, but I think that was mostly due to them having used a little too much flavoring on the kid's size. I'll have to try a larger size next time and I'm really interested in trying their freckled frog next time for a zero calorie option that is lemon juice, salt and chile limon. 

According to their web site none of their flavors are made with high fructose corn syrup. Also, make sure to check out their Facebook page for specials and double punch stamp days.

Is this place selfie worthy?  Why, oh yes!!!

I didn't think I would like this place because I hate their commercials.  I feel like swinging punches when I hear that awful club music...but anyway, this place is actually gorgeous!  Weird and gorgeous.  Class meets obnoxious, that's the best way I can explain the decor.

The moment you walk in, you are greeted with a very perfume-y aroma, it smells luxurious and clean...not like a Vegas casino. We walked by the Book and Stage bar.  It is a lounge with a Library theme, and you can count on the Cosmo to make a library look hip and cool.  The books are not real, but projections of books on glass walls and pillars.  Awesome!  

The hotel has all kinds of nooks and lounges to rest your feet, with plush seating and gorgeous, rich colors.  The Vesper bar reminds me of a bar Superman would go to.  It reminds me of his icy lair.  We've found several giant stilletos and a group of dog statues on the same floor.  So unusual and memorable!  Strangers (drunk at noon, like us) were egging me on to get in one of the giant stilletos and pose for pictures, I'm surprised I didn't fall out!!

The Chandelier bar is the heart of the hotel, it is definitely a must see when you go to Vegas.  I've also heard of the Secret Pizza lounge, but we were already too messed up from the drinks at the Wicked Spoon and at the Chandelier bar to find it.  I heard it's inside a hallway with vinyl records and that the pizza is the bomb!  Too bad we didn't find it, but we will definitely check it out next time!

If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)
It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  
Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  
Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????

A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??

Yess!! 

It's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me, but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town, 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown, which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.

When it comes to Vietnamese food, I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho, so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving. 

When I order a bowl of Pho, I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with. 

Their broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together. 

Service could be better, but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice. 

If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, seek Pho Annie!!

How do you give four women simultaneous (food) orgasms?

First take them to Vegas.  Then take them to Rio and stick them in a long-ass line, make them watch the same loud, lame show twice (and considering that show starts every hour, that gives you an idea of exactly how long that long-ass line was), and force them to see the same freaking faces all around them as they get hungrier and hungrier and crankier and crankier.  Basically the equivalent of taking them to see the English Patient on a first date.

When you have about 30 minutes to go, shake things up a bit by getting two of them hammered off one drink from the casino bar.  (After all, it doesn't take much to get them going if their stomachs are *that* empty. http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/wHN6nbeG3TPvQlEAq1jQKw/l)

Get them *just* to the point where they're saying, "goddammit, this better be damn good!" (http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/xg4EfS0b8ZOaYD0xwiBL1w/l)

...then let them loose.

No foreplay, NO FILLER!!!!!!

Get straight to the point and take these women to the CRAB LEGS.  We're not talking costco style, salty-yet-still-bland, cut up the side for easy access crab legs...we're talking succulent, taste-like-they-just-came-out-of-the-wild-Bering Sea amazing morsels of heaven.  

Seriously, food has never given me such pure joy.  Pure, pure, unadulterated crustacean-induced happiness.

My dearest Village Buffet, you were so memorable, almost 2 months later, I'm still trying to figure out how to quit you.

As I walked up to will call about thirty minutes to showtime, I was astounded at the line of people to the right of the Crown Theater entrance.  "Damn! Is it like this every night?" I asked the box office person.  "Every Saturday night." he said.  You'd think that the actual "King of Pop" himself was about to hit the stage.  Fortunately, I had golden circle seats and avoided all of that.  Maybe tip the guys working the front to get in early and dodge that whole debacle or fake an injury, start limping and tell them you need to be seated immediately.  It was 90 percent full.    
    
MJ's Live?  Four different cast members play him throughout the week.  We were fortunate to see Justin Dean.  The moves and mannerisms were as believable as they could possibly be.  To his credit, I had a hard time telling when he was actually singing or lip-synching.  He would switch from singing into his headset mic and then to a regular handheld throughout while still wearing the headset which was kind of weird but whatever.

The audience took everything over the top.  One guy at the table up front was sporting a full on MJ Jheri curl hairstyle with sunglasses that he wore the entire time.  At another table was an adorable 3 year old with his own plastic mic that danced his face off, and even did some pop star poses with the guitar player.  Then there were the folks looking for a complete suspension of disbelief and going batshit crazy the whole hour.  "OMG! We luuuuvvv you Michaaaaaaaaal!"  Someone needed a Pepsi.

I can't find the exact word for all of it, but there was a fun, schlocky, "am I really being entertained by this right now?" vibe to the whole deal.  Kids would love it.  3.5 stars.

I was jonsing for their pizza since it smelled so good but after having pizza two days in a row, I opted for the Gyro and fries. The gyro came with onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce plus cut fries with the skins on them. I love the fries, they give you a very generous amount. The gyro was great as well, My wife loved their Italian Beef and said it was better than Al's Beef (sorry Al). My only complaint is there isn't a self serve soda machine, just cans of soda for a dollar. I'm definitely coming back for some pizza because it sure smells good.

The Taliesin West is Frank Lloyd Wright's "Winter Camping Home" 

A MUST DO if you're visiting Arizona! A great way to admire and pay homage to one of America's Famous Architects - Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW)

[history]
Frank Lloyd Wright's original Taliesin home is in Wisconsin. After one of his major projects, he had money to purchase land in Scottsdale, Arizona for only $12.50/acre back in the 1930's. Frank wanted to pass on his legacy on and so he had apprentices and mentored them in Arizona and Wisconsin. Frank had drafted the architecture for his new home, but the apprentices had built/constructed the home itself. Frank named this place Taliesin West since it was located West of his Taliesin home in Wisconsin.

[tours]
INSIGHTS TOUR - 90 minutes; $32 adults (student and senior citizen discounts apply)
The insights tour is one of the signature tours at Taliesin West, which gives you a glimpse of the rooms that were built. Your fees go straight to the FLW Foundation - a non-profit organization dedicated to "conserve the priceless tangible and intangible assets that are the legacy of FLW. 

NOTE - there are several other tours available (i.e. night tours, group tours, etc) so you may want to check their website for the other packages that they offer. You can also rent out the area if you want to book weddings, host parties, conduct seminars, etc. (requires rezzies).

[limitations]
FYI - all models, drawings, designs and works by FLW and the Taliesin Architects are exclusive property of the FLW Foundation and so therefore CANNOT be photographed, reproduced, copied, duplicated without written consent. 

You may take photos throughout the tour, but your tour guide will instruct you to when that time is allowed. They are just preserving and protecting the legacy of FLW and I totally understand!  Our tour guide was very knowledgable and was able to answer questions throughout the tour. He had been a tour guide for the last 13 years! Many of the employees here know their stuff about FLW! Each tour would be different as you would get a different spin from each tour guide, but nonetheless, you'd have a wonderful experience. 

FYI -
*No smoking on tour
*Bathrooms located in the gift shop
*Parking is free
*Located minutes away from Downtown Scottsdale
*Beautiful view of the city and sky
*75th Anniversary of Taliesin West (2012)

If you love architecture or would like to admire one of FLW's pieces, definitely stop by Taliesin West! Highly recommended whether if you are a tourist or not!

There's a hair in my arugula. A long, straight hair. I know what you're thinking ... 'well, that's better than a short and curly hair.' Although true, I'm just not in need of the extra protein. Plenty of that provided by the grilled tenderloin sitting atop of said arugula and beside aforementioned hair.

I chose not to make a scene as the place - early afternoon on a Tuesday - was fairly full of fine female patrons. I removed the hair with surgical precision and proceeded to enjoy my lunch. And enjoy, I did.

I saw many many savory items on the menu, but I can only speak to the Arugula-Gorgonzola Steak. Tasty. Oh ... and the sweet potato chips were the truth as well. The place is kinda' unique in that it shares two different suites - a "market" on one side and an "eatery" on the other - joined by a breezeway in the middle. One could enjoy their meal, or a glass of wine outside if one so desired. 

Four stars. I'm not deducting anything for the hair, but the 'Box is awfully proud of their prices and the service leaves much to be desired. I mean, the gal that occasionally tended to me was friendly ... just not necessarily well-versed in the art of prompt, accommodation of customer requests. Like the one I made for silverware and a napkin. Twice. 

That said, the Herb Box was a cute little joint and I'm sure I'll be stopping in again for lunch when I find myself hocking fenestrations mid-day in north Scottsdale.
 
Next time I'll try a twelve-dollar sandwich. Brown Sugar Pork Ciabatta. Sans follicle, if I may.

Taking up residence where Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce used to be is the newest Speakeasy to hit the strip. There's something fun and exciting about entering through a secret door and needing a password to get in. 

I wasn't sure of the stats on the place, so I had called Mandalay Bay box office and the woman had no info to give me, I wasn't sure if we needed tickets prior, or if we purchase there, I then searched the actual 1923 website and didn't get any info there as well. I ended up speaking with concierge and she was the most helpful, this is the info I can pass along to others:

*No cover charge for locals
*$20 cover for non-locals 
*If you're interested in getting a table, you can email info@1923lv.com and they should get back to you within 24 hours.

If you show up around 10p and get yourself a seat at the bar, you'll have a perfect view for the stage, the entire place only holds 150 people, and the place got packed really quick, there were no seats or anywhere to stand by 11. Holly Madison performs 3 times nightly, and the shows run from 11p-2a. 

Jazz band plays intermittently throughout the night as well as a house DJ. They have a small specialty cocktail menu, Pisco Sour included. Our bartender, Marvin, was able to create a cocktail off menu by us telling him what our likes are. 

They have a cigar room in the back and they also sell them at the bar. They do allow smoking in the lounge, and it did get pretty smokey between the cigarettes and cigars, so be warned. 

I loved the burlesque dancers, the 1920's inspired outfits of the cocktails waitresses and bartenders were classy, and the prohibition style cocktails were good. I'd for sure come back.

Best.Bowling.Ever. Well... not by me. I bowled terribly, but I pretty much had the best time ever doing it!

$11.85 for all you can bowl for four hours plus shoes on a Friday night?!? Bargain! $2 beers (Bud Light). I don't drink that piss water but everyone else seemed happy. 

Kick ass DJ rockin Van Halen, Michael J, Phil Collins and The Temptations!? Chickity Check!

Quite possibly the biggest parking lot in the world. I doubt it has ever been filled up.

The bartender was slower than the second coming... literally. I must have missed two round of bowling waiting for my drop top. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars and not five.

SO, yeah... I have my own shoes and ball. I'm a geek, nerd, dork, whatever. Unfortunately the sole of one of my shoes broke off in transit so I had to borrow some from the alley. They were pretty dope. I actually considered leaving the one shoe they take in collateral so I could take those awesome bowling shoes home!!

All I really have left to say is that this is the best bowling alley I have ever been to!

Excalibur is the "bang for your dollar" hotel located on the strip. It's not the nicest looking, doesn't have the most amenities or the most up to date decor.

It gives you the opportunity to be on the Vegas strip at a cheaper price compared to other hotels. If you come with kids or have a big family you are traveling with then Excalibur will offer you value in staying in Vegas.

I had a bad experience with my check in where I was offered a free upgrade offering the pool view and adjacent rooms where we could open the doors to each other's rooms. Neither of those happened and we were too exhausted from the drive to complain or change rooms. 

The pool was great for the kids. They have a single slide there for kids and adults. They have a VIP pool as well. Drinks are expensive, as you would probably imagine. We ordered a bucket with 5 beers and it cost $30.

I would stay here again and here is why: I come here to walk around Vegas, not sit in my room. I don't care to pay for an expensive hotel that I come to sleep in.

Gluttony at it's best!!

This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. 

Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. 

If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...

Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!

I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!

If you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!

So this Nathan's is in the foodcourt at the MGM, which shares the space with a Panda Express-like Chinese food place, a McDonald's, and a Pizza place.  It's actually an interesting place for a foodcourt, considering Craftsteak and SeaBlue (by Michael Mina) are practically right next door.

I got the 2 hot dog and fries combo for $8.95.  The staff seemed friendly enough.  I didn't have any problems.

The hot dogs are just.  I guess you can say it's like how people go gaga over Pink's for no good reason because let's face it, Pink's isn't even really that good.  You go really only for the experience of eating at a Los Angeles institution.  I feel the same way with Nathan's.  It's such a historic New York tradition that when someone says "I want to go try Nathan's" not because it's THAT good, but because it's a cultural experience.  That's my two cents anyway.

I would however have to say that the hotdog skin has nice pop.  You know what I mean?  No?  Amateurs....

I probably wouldn't come back though.

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub. 

We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus. 

The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside. 

Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there. 

The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food. 

Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo. 

The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL. 

We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay

Lifestyles of the (not) Rich & Shameless.

You know life is good when you're wading in the Temple pool, water falling down from the fountain above, massaging your head & shoulders, cooling off from the dry Las Vegas heat.  

My stay was at the new Octavius Tower, which recently opened at the beginning of the year.  The Augustus & Octavius Towers have a separate entrance & lobby, which successfully segregates VIP' s like me (LOL) from the plebs staying at the more economical Palace Tower.  Early check-in was a breeze, and I was soon on my way to room 6278.  

Room - OMFG!  This is nice!  2 queen beds with 4 pillows & a bolster greeted us as we walked in.  A large, flat-screen TV w/ media hub, a Keurig coffeemaker, well appointed minibar & couch were available to peruse at our leisure.  The carpeting was nice & soft, and the room window had a pretty decent view of the Bellagio fountains next door.  

The bathroom was spectacular!  There were dual sinks w/ another flatscreen TV, a whirlpool bath and a separate shower w/ a rainfall showerhead & glass door.  I drew a couple hot baths during my stay and enjoyed soaking my old man body, with the jets seemingly making all my worries go away.  The complimentary bath products were Gilchrist & Soames Qua Bath & Spa.  It could be the just the fancy packaging, but they seemed luxuriant.  

Pool - The Temple Pool is gorgeous.  Forget going in the afternoon, because it's literally shoulder-to-shoulder.  All someone can do is stand & pee.  I made sure to head to the pool the next day when it opened at 8am.  About 30 patrons had the same idea, but fortunately, they were concerned with confiscating pool chairs for sunbathing.  I had the circular Temple Pool all to myself for around 20 mins, in which I swam and waded underneath 1 of the 4 fountains as described earlier. Great way to cool off.  

Complimentary coffee & tea is offered at the Augustus/Octavius lobby during the hours of 7-9 in the morning.  Bonne Maman honey from France is offered in individual mini-jars, of which I have about 10 here at home awaiting for my disposal.  Hey, it's free!  Don't judge!  Across the lobby is a Starbucks in case you don't fancy the free stuff.  BTW, Starbucks located in hotels/casinos don't offer free WiFi.  Bummer.

Express checkout was a breeze.  I reviewed my bill on the flat-screen TV, confirmed checkout and left the room keys in the room.  

I had the time of my life.  I felt like a foreign diplomat on my way to meet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton over cucumber sandwiches to discuss diplomacy.  If you have the money to burn, I recommend staying at Caesar's Palace and re-enact your own "Hangover".

Good times.

Excelsior!

"You probably get this a lot, this isn't the real Caesar's Palace is it? Did, umm... did Caesar live here? I didn't think so." It's ok that the real Caesar didn't live here, at least the place is pager friendly! 

I've always had a pleasant experience staying at Caesar's; although, I can't say the same about losing money while gambling here. You can't miss this massive property right off the Flamingo exit of the I-15.

Somehow, I always end up in the Palace Tower room. That's the room with the exhibitionist shower in between the two bathrooms. You'd think having two bathrooms is convenient until one person is taking a shower but has to lock both doors since the shower doors are glass. If you don't care, shower away and display what yo mama gave you. The dual showerheads make it fun to shower with a friend while doing the earth a favor by conserving water.

The furniture is modern and the rooms are upkept nicely. The beds are comfy I have no complaints. My last trip was with three guys and of course they forgot to pack some toiletries. They had someone bring up toothbrushes, shaving cream and razors, extra shampoo and conditioner, and soap. They even brought up extra robes and slippers.

We pulled an all nighter and I finally got to bed around 10am. We were all feeling lazy later on and they brought back dinner from the food court. Their food court actually has good food unlike food courts from other hotels.

Some may say overrated or not worth the price, but everyone should try the Bacchanal Buffet at least once!

What was once 3 stars is now 2. It's the natural evolution of hotels I guess. New York New York Hotel and Casino is only 15 years old, but it looks 25 now with worn carpet, furniture, and matching down-trodden atmosphere. I've had some of my best casino wins at New York-New York, but don't feel drawn back despite generous player perks.

Once you've stayed at a few of the nicer hotels in Las Vegas, it is hard to go back to normal-size rooms, motel furniture, and basic amenities. Even so, I don't hate New York New York Hotel. It is what is has become. A lower priced hotel option with plenty of $10 tables to work your gambling magic. It is convenient to MGM and most other places on the strip. 


If you're looking for a "reasonable hotel with a cool theme" for a first visit to Vegas, then New York New York may be a great choice. It also is probably a decent option for families since kids can hit the arcade, food court, and roller coaster on their own. Otherwise, if you are a Vegas regular, foodie, or have the $$$ to spend on something nicer then you can find better hotels in LV than NY-NY.

I've always wanted to try Bobby Flay's famous restaurant Mesa Grill but never had the chance till now. After the watching the Celine Dion Concert, we were both starving and my Mom wanted to eat something right away close to the Coliseum and I told her about Mesa Grill which was owned by Celeb Chef Bobby Flay. They say, sometimes he'll be working behind the grill but unfortunately he wasn't there. 

='(

But that didn't stop me from enjoying my dinner with Mum, the place is hip and modern just like the rest of Caesars Palace's restaurants and they don't have a strict dress code, just casual to formal. Staff here are top notch in service and the food here is on the $$$ side but I knew that before walking in and ordering our food since there was a big menu with prices outside of the restaurant.

We ordered:

22 oz Bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye $48
  -side of Mashed Potatoes + Green Chile Queso Sauce $9

Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon
 - Spicy Black Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema  - $32

Both of the entrees were excellent and couldn't fault on anything, bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye was very tender and juicy and included two different sauces hot and mild but I forgot the names. And a side of mashed potatoes, was nothing phenomenal. My mom ordered the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon and that was a great dish. 

Service here great, not excellent. Our waiter never explained the different sauces I had for my Chipotle Rib-Eye and that took it down one star. Other than that, dinner was lovely and I was glad to finally eat in Bobby Flay's Famous Mesa Grill restaurant at Caesar's Palace.

Unfortunately I didn't see Bobby Flay grilling his signature steaks in his kitchen. 

Boo!

We have a lot of snow falling here in the Vegas Valley lately! Shaved SNOW  that is! Frost Bites Shavery caught my attention when I read "Snow Cream" "Smoother" and "Black Sesame" and saw that Michael K's check was in Henderson!  I don't proclaim to be an expert of this dessert that originated in Taiwan but after trying Frost Bites Shavery's version, now we're talkin this is what shaved snow cream is all about.

Walked up and was elated to see Green Tea and Black Sesame flavors on the menu!  Mike the owner and creator was really gracious and offered samples of any flavors I wanted to check out. That's when I discovered the difference between here and the other place. Frost Bites Shavery is the REAL DEAL!

When it was presented to me, it was in ribbon like layers, even looked fluffier and no granular ice crystals like I had at Kuma's. Frost Bites Shavery was way smoother and texture reminded me of fresh fallen snow. It's NOT Snow Cones or shave ice..but a mixture of the two, hence shaved snow! Big plus it's all natural, you won't go into sugar shock from having flavored syrups drowned in ice.
 
Taste wise the flavors I tried ( Mango, Green Tea, Coconut, Black Sesame) had much more depth. Especially the Green Tea. Black Sesame fans will really appreciate this, Mike said he roasts and grinds the black sesame himself.  In fact, all ingredients used to make snow cream are all natural including fresh fruit used to make the Mango snow cream! Which tastes fresh and fruity!  No canned fruit for topping either. That's why Lychee is missing. Can't get it fresh, so they passed on it.  Other flavors I saw were Coffee and your traditional flavors of Chocolate, Strawberry and Vanilla for those who aren't the adventurous types.
 
Price: In line with all the other icy treat stands in the area. Range from $2.25 - $6.25 toppings additional .50 cents.  There are four different sizes. I appreciate they have a kid size for the little ones.
 
Location: Along Boulder Highway between Major and Greenway/Palo Verde. You're reference point is the marquee for Smith's Grocery. It's a freestanding structure. You'll see the pastel blue and white trailer/food truck right on Boulder closer to corner of Greenway/Palo Verde.   Plenty of parking. There's a canopy for shade and a couple of chairs.
  
This snow cream is tastier and  healthier can't beat that! I'm a fan!  Five Stars most def!

Your mileage at Cartel will vary, based totally on your expectations and what you want in a cup of coffee.  If you are concerned about where your coffee beans are grown, how they are roasted, fair trade practices, and the difference between a French press and an aeropress, then this is definitely your place.  If you are looking for a coffee drink that involves a blender, whipped cream, and caramel drizzle, then you'll be disappointed.  I'm not judging either group, because depending on the day of the week I've been in both.  

The day we hit Cartel was for a much-needed caffeine injection.  The coffee menu is very limited, but iced Americano was front and center.  The barista informed me that even though that was a menu option, I was better off ordering an iced coffee that was cold brewed specifically for that purpose.   She went on to give me all of the nuances in great detail.  And she was right, it was an excellent choice.

They also offered homemade pop tarts, which were a must try for me.  They ended up being more like a frozen Pillsbury toaster strudel, just a lot greasier.  

If you're a coffee snob, this is a place you will love.  And rightfully so.  If you just want a cup of coffee and Cartel is closer than Dunkin' Donuts or 7-Eleven, then you may feel overwhelmed or intimidated.  The employees at this location don't do it on purpose, they are just very passionate about their coffee.  And that's never a bad thing.  Now the employees at the Cartel at the airport?  That's a different story, for a different review.

To all the people that are worried about their bodies when they go to a Vegas pool party...just get drunk and have fun because no one cares!
  
Tips:  
There is always a free guestlist for ladies.  Ask around to promotors.  
You must be wearing "fashionable swimwear".  Security will turn you away if you're wearing regular street clothes.
There are lockers at $40 for the day to store your stuff in.  They have all types of cell phone charges inside the lockers too.
Food and drinks are expensive but who cares.  The food is actually pretty good.  And the servings are pretty large.
You can't bring big bags or purses in.  Only tiny clutches.  They make you check large bags ($5) at entry.
You can't bring in any type of drugs, even OTC like asprin, ibuprofen, nothing...not even eye drops!
You can't bring gum, mints or breath spray.  Security said "nothing that can go in your mouth".
The security is way more strict if you go in General Admission or Guestlist line on the left side..  If you're getting a daybed/cabana or have a hookup, and go in on the right side, they don't check your stuff as strict.
Get one of those plastic cups with covers filled with liquor.  The slushy drinks are so good and they will get you f*cked up.  They're $40 and totally worth it, especially if you want to go in the pool with your drink.  Everyone starts splashing and you don't want herpe pool water filling your cup.

A rainy day must! 11:30am and already a line waiting outside. What is this recent ramen obsession of mine? I used to be content eating Cup O Noodles with a cracked egg...don't judge, we've all been slummin' at some point.
A friend of mine recommended Sora and I'm glad to say I can still call her a friend.
First off, I appreciate the quick service and slightly more ample seating. The servers were on their game and quickly delivered the goods with a smile and thorough explanation of the menu. I initially expected to pay a la cart for tamago, chashu and spicy meat like at the other places. But for $8.50 I can get a SPICY MISO RAMEN with all of the above...what a great deal! Of course you can get extra portions of these items for just a $1 or $2...again not a bad deal considering some other ramen houses charge much more.
SPICY MISO RAMEN was perfect! I loved the spicy meat that should be a ramen staple...lean ground meat with a slight sweetness and once mixed into the rich, not too salty miso broth, completes the ramen experience. Chashu is a newly acquired taste for me as I wasn't a fan of fatty pork belly, but in a steamy bowl of ramen is now an unctuous treat I crave. Chashu, slow braised pork belly that takes hours to cook to achieve that tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only thing I didn't like and will probably always have an aversion to is the fermented bamboo shoots..menma. I think it ruins my perfect bowl with its stinky presence...sort of like the uncle no one likes who keeps showing up at dinner. I must remember to omit it from now on.
I enjoyed the simplicity of Sora's ramen that didn't try to pack in everything and give you ramen ADD with adding things like black garlic, chili threads (offenders know who they are). Ramen is a simple bowl of comfort food meant to satisfy and warm the soul. Sora achieves this and is what a good Obaasan (grandma) would approve.

An excellent Xmas day dinner!  This was upscale British pub food done really, really well.  I am already looking forward to the next visit. 

We chose to eat at the bar since a couple of basketball games were on.  That way we could also ask the bartender about their beer selection.  Our bartender let us sample a few and we ended up going with a pints of Innis & Gunn and Moa.  Those were $8.75 each but so was Pacifico and Corona so no point in going for stuff you can get anywhere else.   

The first entree was the "Dublin Brisket" which was set in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The bowl was filled with hearty tender chunks of beef, cheese and sauerkraut that went well with the side of thousand island.  3 standard steak fries=1 fry here so you only get 4 of them which was enough.  

My wife wanted the "Shepard's Pie" and just hearing those two words gave me flashbacks of terrible school cafeteria mush, a poor man's English lasagna if you will.  But this was galaxies away from what I had in the past.  Savory was the word from the first bite.  Each spoonful filled with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots, peas and slow cooked beef and lamb.  A truly awesome dish that I would gladly have any cold weather day.  

We skipped all the good looking appetizers and small plates just to make it to dessert.  Everyone recommended the "Sticky Toffee Pudding" so that's what we had and it did not disappoint.  The perfect ending indeed.

On the scale from 1-10, 10 being the jankiest of janky casinos, I would say this casino is about a 9. It's dark, dim, smoke-infested, and small in here. If you catch this place in the morning, you'll meet the night crawlers and it's not pretty here at the Ellis Island..

But once you reach the restaurant, you'll literally realize, the grass is always greener on the other side. 

Steak & Eggs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=qcM6QdCRzuf-BDTznRHR2w
$4.99! Uh, what?
The steak was pretty delicious and tenderly cooked to my medium-rare option. Is it odd to say that I'm "an egg person?" I'm pretty much a sucker for anything egg and a fan of the runny yolk, on the top, side, or bottom of my food.  The 'taters were crispy golden brown and tasty. The sourdough bread toast (drenched with buttah) hit the spot.  So seriously.. $4.99?

I know there are tons of places on/off the strip for cheap steak, but this is by far one of the places I can agree for its mind-blowing value. You can also opt out the egg, for a "steak dinner" - $6.99.

Oh yes, this place is also a brewery, so our order of house Hef was $2. My mimosa was  $5 and it was kinda huge.

So.. our 4 steak orders and 2 alcohol drinks under $30?
If you lost your soul in what Jay B calls, "Lost Wages," come here. Your wallet will surely thank you, then give one swift kick to the groin.

Funny story: in 2007 I went on a blind date to Social House when it was operated by someone else in TI.  The guy insisted on ordering for me: sunomono (cucumber) salad (the size of a soy sauce dish) and 1 order of tamago (egg) sushi that he split with me.  No joke!  We sat outside and that was my first view of the siren show, ugh.  After that I tore off to Godiva in Fashion Show and bought myself chocolate.  Good riddance.  Fast forward, Social House left TI, and I forgot about it.  Then I was in Crystals one day walking around and saw an ad for desserts in restaurants there.  The yuzu frangipane called my name.

Last night Eric R. and I attended a really cool event at Social House in Crystals.  It was a sake lesson from a sake sommelier, paired with different bites from the food menu.  First we had junmai premium sake paired with yellowtail sashimi with tempura jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro, and calamansi soy.  Did someone say tempura jalapeno slices?  Yes indeedy.  Next, we sampled another sake, some higher level, paired with big eye tuna sashimi, sweet chili sauce, crispy shallot, red onion, and negi oil.

The next dish was amaaaaazing: nasu spicy miso: small delicate roasted Japanese eggplant with spicy miso glaze.  This was truly delicious!!!  Our last dish was a set of rolls: salmon avocado, hama-chimi (hamachi, avocado, jalapeno-cilantro chimichurri, garlic chips), and negi toro (fatty tuna with green onion).  Our final sake was Ty-Ku coconut flavored nigori (unfiltered).  This was actually really delicious.  I have long been a coconut fan but I am on a huge coconut kick lately.  This one is worth purchasing, and I can get it at Total Wine or Lee's according to the sommelier.

This ended up being a really fun event.  At the end, I ordered the yuzu frangipane, which is made to order because it is a molten cake!  Warm almond cake, molten yuzu cream cheese filling, raspberry sorbet, almond toffee, and fresh raspberries.  It was tasty, more like almond than yuzu.  The idea of it is really good, but I am looking for yuzu to punch my taste buds, so this in the end was not quite yuzu-y enough for me :) and it cost $12.  Anyway, I would come back for some bites here, especially that eggplant!

On top of these 4 courses, my friend and I shared an order of the veal sweetbreads, which came with a poached egg and spinach and apple salad.  I LOVE sweetbreads and they were cooked PERFECTLY.  So we essentially had 5 courses.  I also took a couple bites of other people's souffles, and they were pretty good.  The Gran Marnier souffle was better than the chocolate souffle.  

The meal ended with an assortment of petit fours.  There was a classic French canele, some sort of passion fruit gummy thing (I didn't try it), a homemade marshmallow (forgot the flavor) and a macaron (forgot the flavor as well).  Shows you how impressive they were if I couldn't remember half of them.

Service was impeccable.  The bread girl was very courteous, offering 4 different types of bread.  I will have to say while it was good, the pretzel bread at Cut is way better.  Our server Marcus was very attentive and patient with us.  He was very helpful and he and the expediters explained each course and each different dish thoroughly and patiently.  And Marcus poured the wine label up!!!  I learned from my wine instructor in culinary school (who I believe by now is a master sommelier) that proper wine pouring etiquette means pouring the label up as well as slightly twisting the bottle as he raised the bottle from the glass so it doesn't drip.  Yes, I pay attention to these things.

I would definitely come back for this 4 course menu and I would also love to try out the San Francisco location as well.  Thank you Chef Hubert Keller!!!!

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

Seeking spiritual enlightenment in my life, I went on a trek through Vegas to find the church that was right for me. Growing up as a Catholic during my early kid and teen years, I naturally went to a lot of Catholic churches in the area. After attending many services, I remembered why I became disillusioned with the Church in the first place.

Then, I was reading either the Seven, or VW (can't remember), and they had a story on the largest churches in the Valley. They mentioned that CCC was the biggest church in the state. Intrigued, I attended a service.

Walking in, I noticed that this was not your "mom and dads" church. Everyone was dressed comfortably. And, there was a coffee shop as well. Already, things were looking up! When going inside the auditorium, it reminded me of a music venue, with stadium seating. And on stage, there was band playing Christian rock music. It felt like I was at a concert!

After wards, there was the offering. What is great is that a lot of the money goes into developing our community. 

The highlight is the sermon. This is not your typical one (if you have attended a denominational church). What I liked most about it was that every speech touches "home". No matter where you are in your life, Pastor Jud and his team know how to make it relevant to every single individual, somewhat like "words of wisdom". 

So, even if you are or are not Christian, or don't believe in any God in particular, CCC is a great place to go if you feel like something is missing in your life, or, you just want to be around people that are searching for the same answers to life as yourself. Plus, the coffee is good :)

How do you know that you received a good haircut?
When you not only feel great when you look in the mirror, but you get compliments left and right from family, friends, and colleagues.

I went to see Laurn recently and took advantage of their Yelp special, which at the time was "get a signature SHINE treatment, therapeutic scalp massage and an eyebrow shaping FREE with any hair service."  While I love the salon I'd been going to for years, I just wanted to change it up, so that's exactly what I did (or what Laurn and Mindy did for me).

Mindy handled the SHINE treatment, wash, scalp massage, and brow shaping and did an incredible job... and then I was back in Laurn's chair where I felt comfortable immediately.  I knew I was in good hands!

I told Laurn I wanted some shorter layers and I told her about my normal routine (which is drying my hair on a good day and leaving the house with a wet head on other days).  She gave me some great suggestions (ie: big hot rollers) as she cut and dried my hair.  I was extremely pleased with my hair when I left.  It was exactly what I wanted!

I found the pricing reasonable, the Root's atmosphere pleasant, and all of the girls extremely friendly.  If you're looking for a fabulous salon, look no further than The Root!

This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!

In fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!

My first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really "being there," if you know what I mean.

My second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.

Just Kidding. 

Now, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.

A few weeks after my first visit, I went to Sweets Raku again since they have new menu items.  I took my sister here so we can try Mt. Fuji, Veil and Ringo. As for the tea, we tried Tokio (sweet berries green tea) and Sakurambo (Japanese cherry black tea) with our dessert prix fixe. I have officially tried all their desserts, yay!

Amuse:
Mango sorbet with mint jelly.  The mango sorbet was a little bit tangy but very delicious with the mint jelly. I had the strawberry sorbet the first time. Both flavors are very good since they're two of my favorite fruits. 5/5

Mt. Fuji:
Spongecake, chestnuts with chestnut cream, chestnut tuile, chestnut and chocolate. I grew up liking chestnuts and chestnuts in dessert isn't common in Western cuisine so, this was a no-brainer.  5/5

Ringo:
Apple pie with honey ice cream, white chocolate dusted with cinnamon. There's a sugar candy shaped like an apple that has cream inside. An American classic got exciting again. Break the candy apple with your spoon for cream to put on your apple pie. The apple pie itself isn't sweet so eat it with honey ice cream. 5/5 

Veil:
Stuffed custard pie is what i says on the edible menu so it doesn't sound so interesting. I really was hesitant to order this because how exciting is custard pie? But I must say, I saved the best for last. What you get is flaky pastry with custard on top and in the middle...on top of berry cream swimming in compote all wrapped in a web made of sugar. The Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mousse) is a safe and obvious choice for chocoholics like me but I stepped out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did. This is the best item they have on their menu. Confetti and glitter! 5/5

Excellent service as usual and our server, Kazue remembered me from my first visit. I'm still in love with this place. It makes me feel like a kid again. Genius! I think I might be addicted to this place now. The best way to end my birth month. Remember to join their e-mailing list.  Sit at the bar (if it's available) so you can watch the action and talk to the chefs. It's $19 for the prix fixe menu (sorbet + your choice of dessert + petit four) or $12 for just dessert (Apollo, Marriage, Veil, Mt. Fuji or Ringo). If you get Apollo wit your prix fixe, you'll get cheesecake instead of the lava cake. For descriptions of the other dessert items, read my previous review.

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

I love roller-coasters. LOVE them. Not in like the "oh, hey look at that roller-coaster over there I'd sure like to ride it" sort of way. More like an obsessive, all-consuming, contantly-looking-for-that-thrill kind of way. 

So when I heard that the Stratosphere hotel housed some of the tallest roller-coaster rides in the world, I had to go. 

When we walked up to the hotel, I was dubious- should I trust a hotel with my life that hasn't had a makeover in a 30 years? Seriously, this hotel is dingy, dirty, old, and all around decrepit. I would NEVER stay here. It was laughable. I should have listened to my gut, and turned away then, but my need to conquer the world tallest roller coaster ride prevailed. 

On the way up to the rooftop, we took the worlds fastest elevator. It took seconds to shoot the hundreds of floors to the top. I started to feel dizzy, and things started spinning around me. I felt nauseous. Spencer grabbed me and told me there was no way I was getting on the ride. WHAT! I immediately straightened up, smiled, and told him I was just fine. I had to get on this ride. I wasn't leaving Vegas until I did. 

We rode the X-Scream, which according to the Stratosphere's website is "a giant teeter-totter that propels you 27 feet over the edge of the Tower, 866 feet above the ground". Basically it is a flimsy 8-person bobsled that juts you out over the edge of the building and maniacally slides you back and forth. Did I mention it is controlled by a gum-snapping 18 year old? 

This ride was not fun. It was terrifying in every sense of the word. Everyone on the ride was silent...just holding on for dear life, praying for it to be over. Luckily for me, I didn't have to experience the whole ride. One moment, I am having horrifying thoughts of tumbling to my death, and the next moment, I wake up to people screaming "PLEASE! We need help! Someone help her!" 

Halfway through the ride, my eyes rolled in the back of my head and my whole body convulsed violently. A seizure? A panic attack? I don't know what it was, but I do know it was my mind and body telling me I had pushed it too far this time, and it needed to check out. 

Call me crazy, but after that experience, I rode Big Shot (hey I prepaid for the ticket) which shoots passengers straight up 160 feet at 45 mph (over 4 Gs) until they are 1,081 feet above the Strip. It was seriously fun, and I would recommend that ride to other thrill seekers. 

Yelp's one star rating sums this up perfectly for me: Eek! Methinks not.

We splurged at Mix. And we splurged in style. 

The photos of the truly glamorous restaurant located on the 64th floor of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay speak for themselves: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA?select=X7QyN6HCtkdcyuKjmp0yPg

The incredible views and stunning modern decor alone are worth the visit. The superb service, fantastic wine & cocktail menu and amazing food complete the experience. 

Our server, Lee Christopher, had a wonderful way about sharing his knowledge and love for renowned French Chef Alain Ducasse's culinary creations at Mix. The way he described the dishes were so colorful, and I was certain that no matter what we ended up ordering, it would be just as amazing as it sounded.

The menu features French and American dishes, including Alain Ducasse's signature dishes from his Monte Carlo and Paris restaurants. When you see the price of each dish you may have sticker shock, but let it sink in for a second, and remind yourself that you deserve to indulge in fine food every now and then. Appetizers are $20+ and entrees are $40+. The bison tenderloin I had was $52, and let me tell you, it was worth every cent!

Jessica had the pistachio encrusted striped bass with asparagus and Nicole had their version of Surf 'n Turf - halibut and seared foie gras over brussels sprouts and black truffle. Everything was succulent and savory. The fish dishes were fluffy and light, and even the vegetables were cooked to perfection. The bison tenderloin was all of our favorites. Encrusted with crushed black pepper, it had a wonderful kick, and the meat was extremely tender. If this was my last meal, I could die happy.

What made our dinner that much more remarkable was the fantastic service. There must have been at least 3 different servers that attended to our table, as well as Steve, the charismatic General Manager, throughout the evening. They went above and beyond to make our experience memorable, chatting with us and offering us individual wine pairings with our entrees, a lilikoi, rum and panna cotta foam cocktail the bartender created especially for us and the most amazing Riesling with our dessert. The meal ended with madeleines that were brought to us in the baking pan straight from the oven with Nutella. It was divine!

We took photos out on the balcony (if you can manage to get seating out there, the view is breathtaking) and even had a little photoshoot on the circular staircase surrounded by the incredible glass bubble curtain. Before leaving, we went over to Mix Lounge, which was an extension of the fab restaurant. 

Mix was truly the highlight of our entire Vegas weekend, and you should make it yours too.

Here's the deal on the new stadium. The parking situation has improved dramatically from their former location. There are people directing traffic and parking is $7 bucks. There are a lot of great food and beverage options at this park. I had the beef & sausage combo with giardineria without the bread falling apart. Definitely a five star meal. They have food trucks located within the park grounds which you have access to during the game. The Dos Gringos watering hole is in the shade and is awesome when the Cubs are getting spanked 11-0. Drown those sorrows, there's always next year.

Seating in the stands is like sitting in the middle seat on an airplane. These seats seem to be smaller than Wrigley Field and not as much leg room. The guy next to me was wondering where he could pay the extra $10 bucks to get more headroom. There was a spinner in front of me that didn't seem to have a problem fitting in her seat, but she was obviously in the minority. I could only take about 3 innings before I had to get out and walk around. The next time I go to this stadium I'll sit on the lawn.

Also, the sound system is poor when you are in the stands. You can't hear anything. It's okay when you are in the outfield. I guess the funniest thing I saw was this guy using his binoculars to read the menu when he was 5 feet away from the counter. Yes - the menu writing is really small. I have better than 20-20 vision and I can't read it until I get to the counter.

I was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at 630am to drive and pick up my Bountiful Basket from Ahwatukee. To help offset the sleep, I decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee, Dunkin Donuts.

As I walked back to my filthy, dusty car, I got the overwhelming desire to wash it. Now, folks, on the rare occasions when I want nothing more than to clean my car or house, I try to monopolize on the opportunity, so I drove around to three different car washes in an attempt to get my baby cleaned... but as luck would have it, not one god damned place was open.

Just when my will to live was seconds away from being squashed, I suddenly remembered that there was a Groupon special a week ago for Clean Freak, and I felt like it was a moment of Nachos (see Dallas G.) so I decided to see if the Nachos Gods were on my side this day.

Well guess what, Clean Freak was open! And I was excited because that big blue tunnel was just fascinating! And what is this? $10 for the most pricey wash that cleans my tires too?? AND air freshener?? SCORE!!! And to boot, the cashier dude was in holiday spirit wearing his Halloween costume!

Now, here comes this crappy part... the wash really wasn't that good. My windows weren't clean and there was still grime all over my tires. I had to buy window cleaner. None of the dead bugs came off my grill, either.

Oh.... and the vacuum's... I honestly believe that they could have sucked an unborn child from my womb had I been carrying one. But instead it got one of the many pieces of my stereo console. I'm sure that is going to cost me good money to replace. Thanks.

Next time I have to make such an effort to get my car washed, I will just live like a filthy slob until I can find time to make it over to Danny's Family. It may cost $25 but at least my car is clean and I don't have to worry about losing my uterus.

I came to McCormick & Schmick's after a long day at the convention center, the sign from Flamingo Rd called me in.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#iNveMHB89iN7PG4Z_Xgd9Q

Hey it was happy hour too! Monday Night Football. So like a lemming I drove off the Flamingo cliff to M&S.

I asked the waitress to seat me at the bar so I could watch the game, and I quickly struck up a conversation with a couple of Canadians who came in at the same time as me. They mentioned that they had been here the night before and had the surf n turf and it was awesome.

But wait time to get the fade going, margarita rocks no salt and some of the mussels  and an order of the garlic fries off the appetizer menu. 

Think they had to go farm the little black mussels 'cuz they took forever! Meanwhile my drink came, tasty but hardly any booze and loaded with ice. Finally my teasers showed up. I order another Marg,  but this time I tell her easy on the ice heavy on the tequila. 

TEASERS:
Black Mussels ... Tasty li'l critters in a herb wine bath, but 1/3 of them were missing the prize in the middle.  2.5***Stars

I got a stand of lightly seasoned shoe string fries.  I asked for some Tapitio NOPE!  But they did have some Siriacha to give 'em some life.  2**star fries

I ordered my entree and a spinach salad and another marg. 2nd marg was better but told her to double the tequila , 1/2 the ice this time. 

SALAD:
Wild Mushroom Spinach Saute ... this was the best thing I had here. The shrooms and spinach were cooked with a sesame oil and were great. 4**** Stars

The steak looked good but was chewy and lacked any beef flavor. The Lob tail was overcooked and rubbery but had a little smack off the grill and dredged in butter was palatable.

The staff was friendly, the place had a nice interior and a sweet bar. The service was hit and miss. 3***Stars

M&S was a bust for me, an overpriced meal lacking flavor.

I will not return here as there are too many other great places to eat within walking distance.

Yeah...notsomuch.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like "um...there might be a better way to do this..."

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me "You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it." I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said "NO" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word "water") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!" 

I said "It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion." (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. 

I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.

Oh how I love wine country... and now, thanks to Oakville Grocery, we've got our own little taste of wine country right here in the Valley!

While I anxiously anticipated the opening of this unique little gem, I finally made it in for a visit over the weekend... and there isn't too much more to add than what Aimee and Linda already wrote.  (Those bitches beat me to the punch!)

While I went in just to get a drink and check it out, I wanted to yelp about it sooner than later so more people will know about this recently opened grocery.  I can say, without a doubt that I'll be back soon.  One visit to this place is not enough.  Their salads and sandwiches look fresh and delicious, their pizza and prepared foods do too.  I love their espresso bar area and especially that they carry Julia Baker Confections.  Whether you're looking for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, a snack or a full meal, to dine in or to take out, this place has something for you.

While I'd much rather transport myself to the original Oakville Grocery in Napa Valley, I'll settle for Scottsdale Quarter in the meantime.  Cheers!

This was the second time I have been to Ajo Al's.  The first time was about 10 years ago when I first visited Phoenix.  I remembered it well.  I like the atmosphere.  Warm and welcoming, lots of cool are and things to look at.  I did not know this was a chain until I read the other reviews.  This is no Chevy's though.  This is far better, in my opinion.  The chips and salsa are fresh and flavorful and plentiful.  The basket they bring you is huge!  I had chicken flautas and they were delicious.  They topped them with guac and pico de gallo.  The rice was fluffly and moist and the beans were good too.  I only had ice tea but that was some of the best ice tea I have ever had.  I don't know what made it so good.......I mean it's ice tea, but I downed two glasses of it in no time flat.  

I know there are tons of other non-chain mexican places in Phoenix and I will try them all!!  I love mexican food!!  But I will come back to Ajo Al's too.  I'd like to try a margarita next time.  :)

I love having this healthy option near home.  I have been here twice now and I enjoyed it every time.  I keep having the same thing because it was so delicious.  The local fish is a platter with grilled fish, any way you like it.  I always choose the south of the border, it is spicy, but not burn your tongue spicy.  I love it.   You also get the cole slaw and tomatoes and onions.  I never eat all my brown rice.  I was glad that the second time I got it, the amount of rice was smaller, I still left about half of it on the plate.  I am a portion conscious person and I think the piece of fish is really big.  My hubby had the seafood salad and it was delicious, I stole one of his grilled shrimp.  The first time the wait was a little long, but it was the first week they were open.  The second time the food was out within 20 minutes, which is very reasonable.  This will definitely be in my rotation.

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

So, all week before my Vegas trip I was super pumped about a schmancy $100 brunch reservation we had at some other restaurant. It turned out to be okay, but that night we went to Johnny Smalls for a $20 all-you-can-eat tapas dinner and it blew that fancy schmancy brunch out of the effin' water.

Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my number

There was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sidled on up to the bar and had dinner and drinks there all served by Anthony, the most kickass flair bartender/server EVER. And you know how I mentioned that $20 AYCE earlier? It really is AYCE. Anything on the menu. From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra. 

...word on the street is that they are upping the price to $30 for AYCE after the new year, but even if that's true this is still one of the best values for endless deliciousness around.

If you're looking to be wow'ed by a Las Vegas buffet, look elsewhere, toots.

The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-

Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.

Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.

Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.  

The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.

Excelsior!

My name's Yee Gan and despite a fear of heights, I'm an adrenaline junkie. I love roller coasters and have even done a tandem skydive

So, when I saw that the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas had a new extreme experience - the SkyJump, I couldn't resist. It's not cheap at $109 per jump with filming costing extra

They're smart in allowing you to watch from the landing zone on the roof of the main building - you can see the jumpers falling from the 108th floor with their descent being slowed down by 2 zip wires on either side of the jumper. You can also watch their entire descent on a TV monitor inside the shop where you sign in for your jump and buy merchandise.

Although I love my thrills, the thought of jumping from the 108th floor was terrifying and it took me quite a while of watching and finally almost forcing myself to sign up.

After a safety briefing and ride up the tower, you're ready to enter the jump room with the opening to the outside and a jump into oblivion! A few people have got up here and have then been unable to enter the room. I must say that this was the most scary part of the experience as you look down a very long way at what appear to be toy cars.

Then, all too soon, you on the edge of the platform, ready to jump. It definitely takes a lot of bottle to actually step off the platform - that's the hardest bit but the descent was a little disappointing. The wires arrest your descent almost immediately and you don't come anywhere near terminal velocity like on a skydive. The big painted target on the landing area comes up quite quickly though and you're soon on terra firma.

It is a unique experience and adrenaline rush to step off the 108th floor of a building but the descent doesn't quite deliver the same rush and it's the same price as a good show in Vegas, so you have to decide whether it's worth it but it's certainly a unique experience

Not counting price I like this store and the service. 
My favorite, a fellow I call Scotsman the meat counter man. I don't know if this gentleman is from Scotland or not, but his language reminds me of one I know. But the key distinguishing factor for him is his superb service and great attitude. He is just  short of your personal butcher. He takes his time with you, and he does not rush you on. Listens, gives advice and is extremely helpful. When necessary he will look in the back to satisfy your request . He alone could keep me coming back. Oh, and also the meat counter is excellent overall. Great selection,  and good cuts.
What else, well the cheese section is outstanding, the prepared foods are plentiful and tasty. I like the baked goods also. Another nice feature is you can eat right there, which I do sometimes so I don't food shop when starving, which always costs me more somehow.

Sala Thai is a local Thai eatery with another location in North Phoenix.  While this location is pretty small and unassuming from the outside, it really has a lot of character once you step inside.  It's clean, has traditional Thai pagoda roofing decor, and oh so charming!

My normal go-to favorites from Sala Thai are the Duck Curry, Mussuman Curry, and the Pumpkin Curry.  If there was a way to combine duck, the pineapple chunks, the peanuts, the potatoes, and the pumpkin from the three curries listed, it would be the best curry ever.  I'd name it:  THE CURRY OF LIFE.  Oh my goodness!  *hyperventilating*  

The food is delicious and fresh but I wish the portions were a tad bigger for the price I'm paying.  Sure they serve everything in huge bowls and while I do love to slather curry sauce all over my rice, I wish I had more veggies and protein IN the curry.  The friendly service makes up for the humble portions though.  Definitely stop by this little strip plaza gem and give it a try!

Mom and I stopped in to my favorite breakfast joint on the way to the airport.  I decided to try something I haven't tried before, so I went with the Peanut Butter & Cream Cheese stuffed French Toast w/Bananas.

After a short wait, our oder came out.....their portions are enough to feed two people!  I wish they offered a 1/2 order.  Oh well, I did my best to finish this thing, but it proved to be too much for me.  The combination of Peanut Butter and Cream Cheese was awesome!  It was so good I didn't need any Syrup or Butter added to it.

Bernie's cracks me up. If you call the number you reach the barber shop next door. Bernie's doesn't have a phone but the barber shop can tell you their hours of operation.
I've taken my car there twice now, it is a hand wash spot and it has a little Mexican restaurant inside. I haven't tried the food, so the review is just on my carwash.

First time they did a great job, except for when I left all the windows streaked with water because they didn't dry it enough. 

Second time they also did a great job, but they took over an hour and I was the only car there.

Also, both times the sign I read said $11.99 for the wash, yet I was charged $14.99.. I tried to explain this in my best spanglish but the lady ringing me up just kept asking if I wanted a taco..

So all in all this carwash isn't too bad (if time and money aren't an issue). Maybe next time I'll try the taco.

Disclaimer: I didn't try the sushi. I didn't need to.

The wife and I actually came here because they were advertising 1 cent bottles of beer. Goes to show you our priorities... Anyway we walk into this fine establishment to find the penny beers waiting for us. Typical Bud Light/Miller Light, but who cares! They're a penny!

They ambience is great. Low light, quiant booths with a bar on one side. When I use the word quaint, I don't mean small. Yes, it IS small, but it is a very pleasant small.

Well, I've been on a quest to find all the yummy ramens of the valley.  Lo and behold, whats on their menu? You got it! Ramen.  Chicken or Beef or Seafood or Spicy Bonzai, you can't go wrong.  I got the beef with the Udon noodles and I SWEAR to you... they brought out a GALLON of soup. A GALLON! There wasn't much to it, but it was tasty.  Noodles, sprouts, seasoned broth, and beef.  We also ordered a plate of the Honey Chicken and it DIDN'T disappoint.  It was twice the size of PeiWei's similar dish, and MUCH tastier.  With it, came a dish of white rice.

This place was right under my nose.  I will definitely be back! I want to try the spicy Bonzai ramen.  They say if you can eat 2 bowls, its free! That would be... 2 Gallons of soup.

I bought a supposedly comfortable pair of shoes for Vegas.

Comfortable? Comfortable?!!!

I'd like to see the Nike ColeHaan "geniuses" behind these so called comfy shoes, walk the strip in the boots from hell.

Anyways - after a night full of painful foot issues, and chaotic club lines - we decided that the three Miss Yelps were in dire need of some pampering.

And so after doing some Yelp research beforehand - we decided on Qua. 

Just like Nicole C - said - Qua Spa is the Ultimate.

The treatments are a little pricey - but I've heard they're well worth it.  (Connie loved her massage). Nicole and I decided to just use the facilities. For about 40 dollars, you can get access to the dream facilities that make up Qua.

For forty dollars you get access to big Romanesque indoor pools of warm (Tepidarium), hot (Caldarium) and cold water (Frigidarium), with sensual overhead rain showers.  Pure aqua bliss. You can spend all day dipping your body in each, and once your body is relaxed and revitalized by the mineral enriched waters,  you can grab the latest gossip magazine and lounge on the reclined hot stone chairs, which heat up your core - allowing for one of the best naps you'll ever take.

If you're done sitting poolside, you can then head to the lounge area, to grab some fruity hot and cold teas (all teas throughout the spa are organically grown with only natural ingredients and flavors ). 

One thoroughly hydrated, you can wrap your robe tightly around you, as you make your way to the next heavenly phase in the adventure - the Laconium and Arctic Ice Room.

The Laconium room is the sauna. It's the perfect place to clear your pores and sweat out any vodka and redbulls injested the night before.  Lying back on the wooden benches, you feel your body become lifeless, as your forehead heats up. Once throughly warmed - you head to the Arctic Room.

The Arctic Ice Room has heated floors and benches where you can sit perched as you watch snow fall before you. It's soothing, and magical, and takes you back to the excitement you felt when young. Utter awe at the early signs of resh falling winter.

Feeling the chill, you emerge from the brisk world  - back into Qua reality  - an amazing shower with high quality shampoo and conditioner (Qua even has a handy contraption to get the water out of your bathing suit in a matter of seconds)

Feeling alive, awake, and amazing  - you slather yourself in moisturizer, brush your hair, get dressed, and leave Qua a better and healthier person.

If you're going to Vegas - go big. 

Go to Qua to forget the craziness of the night before, and to get ready for the craziness that lies ahead.

Let me start off with this: I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me. 

We had seven in a party and made reservations.... even with the reservations we had to wait. I told the hostess that it was ridiculous to take reservations and then make people wait. After rolling her eyes she found three tables shoved them together and walked away. 

You want to talk about a real Yelp review? 

My party ordered one of each pizza on the menu. I am not joking. If this pizza is so good then we will try each one and take the left overs home! Right? 

WRONG! 

Everything was burnt and just plain blah. Not one person in my party liked the pizza and promised never to come back here again. 

The prices are preposterous, the people are pretentious and the pizza is pitiful.

Taiwanese ice, Vegas style.

Am I in hell?  It's 110 degrees.  The Prius says 125 outside.  I'm seat belted in and  on the 15 when I realize I'm still wearing a hoody.  AC not cooling s#!%.  Finally, the trailer.  Frost Bites Shavery and relief.  Within minutes cup in hand.  Scoop one, light, fluffy, COLD, ahhhh.  Scoop two, body temperature falling, I'm forgetting I'm still wearing a hoody.  Scoop three; NOOOOO, it's melting!!!

This is good stuff.  Hawaii yeeps, think Frostcity on steroids.  Ribbons of fluffy goodness are shaved  from blocks of highly concentrated. naturally flavored ice.  Light, fluffy, delicious for the first two or three scoops then the texture changes it quickly becomes wet and "mushy", the sweetness becomes cloying.  Stick to the smallest size.  You can always get another.  (went back four times in one visit.  Scoop, scoop, toss, order, scoop, scoop, toss... Things we do for yelp)  

Flavors are strong and delish while the ice stays ice.  Vanilla (cloying sweetness), mango (floral, intense, cloying finish), green tea (bitter sweet tea flavor, best once melted), black sesame (nice sesame aroma, different, cloying finish).

Toppings are akin to a froyo bar, ie big chunks of fruits, nuts, crackers, candy, and cookies.  They detract and overpower the ice.  Too much crunch or texture and flavor.  

Inexpensive ranging from $2.25 to $6.25 for a family size cup.

Very good but more of a sweet treat than a chilling refresher (I guess that's why we have beer).

My four years at Arizona State University (2003-2007) were some of the most interesting times of my life - during this time I made some amazing friends, grew tremendously as a person, and even spent about three years working for the University (and absolutely loving it for the most part). Why then, might you wonder, am I giving ASU such a low rating?

Simple.

The quality of education is lacking at best, and laughable at worst. Granted, my experience is going to be different than someone who majored in the hard sciences, law, business, engineering, or any of Michael Crow's other pet projects. I had the misfortune of dual-majoring in Psychology and Women's Studies, both areas of study that fall under the Liberal Arts. 

The University, by the way, refused to confer my Women's Studies degree because the numerous advisers I met with neglected to tell me that I had missed the cutoff deadline by about a semester. So, despite doing all the work and finishing my thesis, I was awarded a minor, alongside an invitation to take fifteen completely unnecessary credits to get my second degree. When translated to cold, hard, cash, that comes out to the tune of ~$9,000. 

In the end I decided to forget about the second major - an undergraduate degree in the Liberal Arts from ASU isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Do not take this to mean however, that good professors don't exist - I've met plenty of fantastic professors during my time at ASU, but I also saw a number of them leave, disgusted by Crow's vision for the college. 

As an employee, I got to see the ASU that a lot of students don't - I had the opportunity to talk to many professors at staff meet and greets who simply couldn't deal with what they'd come to refer to as "bureaucratic bull****". I've talked to no less than half a dozen professors who left, tired of frustrating tenure requirements, narrow minded research-oriented policies, and uneven allocation of educational funding. So, really, it's not just the students-at-large that are treated like second-class citizens at the university. The teachers present get their fair share of abuse too. 

In addition to the education, there are a host of other things wrong with ASU - astronomical parking prices, overemphasis on new dorms, mandatory meal plans (for on-campus students anyway), and terrible student/alumni support, to name a few. 

Make no mistake about it. Michael Crow's ASU couldn't care less about the quality of education that you receive at this "university". If you want to get the best education your money get get you, look elsewhere.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

The word bachi means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.                                                                                            
That's sweet...but that's not why I came to Bachi! This is why I came:

"Grilled to your desired temperature, our burgers are glazed and caramelized over an open flame using a proprietary soy, sake, and mirin-based marinade. The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye"...GOOD GOD!

Bachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe. 

The menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.

Since I don't make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:

Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg

Ronin Burger- Caramelized onions, Japanese Cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ & Yuzu citrus aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=buuw6JhKpiwkp5ShWAqGqg 

Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Pork Belly, cilantro scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette & five spice Hoisin BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dbB6j3SqnngaPORSemc2yw       

Truffle Parmesan Fries- Parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=EI77DnK2YetftJkN_EnR0A

Dipping Sauces- Sun dried tomato aioli, pineapple ketchup, Yuzu citrus aioli & garlic chili aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dzbNYbrAZdjErCp-T5F8kw

Portuguese Donuts- Coffee ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=u4J7iFwsi2cqeHtoxfcCcg

Watermelon Milk Tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkA

We started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had. 

Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. 

Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It's worth leaving the strip for. TRUST

I recently moved in The Modern, formerly known at Luxe Lofts, which failed with the economy tanked even though the exterior was 95% done and the interior 98% done. Since becoming The Modern, it has gotten a wonderful facelift with some fresh stucco and beautiful finishes all around the complex.

Coming from Veer Towers, my standards were pretty high, but The Modern seems to be fitting the bill fairly well. The amenities seem endless here! The gym is fantastic with a wide variety of equipment and is looked upon by the yoga loft above it. There's a private room for massages, showers, a bathroom specifically for gym use. There's a steam room and sauna. The pool area is not just one pool, but three pools lined with cabanas and completed with a large jacuzzi, big enough for fifteen people or more.

The common area has nice large lounging couches with fountains, grills and a fire pit (can't wait until winter!) There's a club house with a large television for watching movies, but really, who wouldn't want to just watch a movie in pajamas in their own unit? My favorite part about the club house is that they have table shuffleboard! Yes. Really. They also have Foosball tables around the property. On the roof they have another area dedicated to entertaining. It's outfitted with large dining tables and more grills.

The security here seems decent enough, and at the moment the whole complex is barely occupied since they are for sale as of recently. They are currently renting out only a few units, and selling the majority of them which I think will keep a certain kind of resident. The only issue with this complex is that it's TOO new.. there's still a lot of hiccups. Getting things fixed and turned on.. having the trash chute unlocked which still hasn't happened! It took a couple weeks to get the access card for the gym and pool.

I'm sure over time these things will smooth themselves out. For now, I'm just enjoying the peaceful quiet and sleekness of the modern glass walkways, the wood floors, large picture windows, granite counter tops and kitchen bedecked with stainless steel Kitchen Aid appliances.

A tour de force of Spanish cuisine.  

A meal at E is a dining experience capturing the excitement and joy of discovery through food and conversation.  This exclusive restaurant within a restaurant is a tapas bar on steroids.  Modernist cuisine at its finest as molecular gastronomy collides with traditional techniques.  This is one of the greatest foodie adventures bar none.

There is no menu.  The offerings change with the seasons.  Unfortunately, the incredible salt crusted foie from the fall of 2011 is not a part of the current winter 2012 offering.  All good.  

The ingredients are incredible.  From selections of sublime, umame packed cured ham to the sweet earthiness of roasted Iberico pork to the salty brininess of quality caviar everything works to create flavor explosions.

Sure, every course may not be to your liking but with the huge number of courses, you are sure to find something you can't live without.  The progression of dishes is very bold.  Courses compete with one another, with each making a bolder statement than the last.  Utterly incredible.  

Desert lovers rejoice, the meal ends with multiple deserts.  The only way to describe them is WOW!

Opt for the wine pairing.  The selections tie the meal together perfectly.  

The entire evening is engaging.  You watch the chefs prepare and plate the majority of dishes right in front of you.  Conversation between the chefs and your fellow guest is encouraged.  It is an extremely social meal.  Just wait until you start sharing wine from the porron.  Unintentionally missing your mouth and pouring wine on your face and down your neck is a real ice breaker.

There is only one way to make a reservation at E, through email.  Don't bother calling the Cosmo.  They can't help you.  Send an email request to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with the number of your party (not to exceed eight), and a range of dates and times.  A restaurant manager will respond and ask about any food allergies and dietary restrictions.  If your restrictions can be met and if there are openings, your invitation will be confirmed.  You will receive your golden tickets via SNAIL MAIL.  Bring them with you.

Probably the best $250 you will spend at a top restaurant anywhere.

An open mind and open heart?  You will have the time of your life.  Highly recommended!

Okay, I have a some rules. 

Fast food places cannot earn Four Stars. My logic is somewhat simple and straight forward; it's  due to their uniformity and universal blandness. How can one Mickey D's, be better than another or differentiated?  Close you eyes and tell me where you are. Try it sometimes. 

That said, this one is real close to being Four Stars. The folks behind the counter, Patti and Maria in particular are all very nice. They will go out of their for you and seem to really like their jobs.  Wow

I come here a couple of mornings each week, not for the Egg McMuffin or Big Breakfast; but to order two egg whites. That's right, egg whites. They're only $0.98 each, and they'll allow you to substitute them on any sandwich for free. Throw in a coffee and you'll be out the door for less than four bucks. Nice!

It UR on a diet, or just want to eat healthier, I would highly recommend it.  So "A-Okay", bordering on "yes, I'm a Fan"

Wow, wow, wow.  My hubby and I have been wanting to come to Breadfruit for a while.  My hubby has been to Jamaica and all over the Caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine.  We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.  The experience at  Rum Bar was so great we can't wait to come back and bring friends.

If someone opens up a tonkatsu restaurant in Japan, the owner is convinced that their tonkatsu is fucking awesome and the best around.  While there's certainly no market for upscale $30+ tonkatsu meals on the corner of Jones and Robindale, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does a decent job of breading, frying and serving meat.  They're definitely the best around...since they're the only place around!!

My wife got the hire (pork) katsu dinner which was better than the ebi (shrimp) katsu.  The shrimp was quite large which was a plus.  I went with the ebi just to have a variety but I should have just gotten the other pork option (Rosu).  After all, there's a pig on the freakin sign so that should give you some hints on what to order.  The meal comes with miso soup, rice and a little onion.  

After you grind the sesame seeds, transfer the amount you'd like into the black dish with the sauce, don't put the sauce directly into the grinding bowl.  That's the wrong way to do it and you limit the size of the piece you dip by using the small bowl.  I noticed several people doing this while we were there.    

The quality of their pork is better than Japanese Curry Zen and they give a substantial amount more.  I plan on trying the katsu curry next time for sure and I'll be ready to bump it up a star or two if the curry is great.

Ahhhh...the feel of 24 carat gold on my face...

Walking around Kierland Commons in Phoenix the other day with a good friend, Karen, we noticed that one of the stores in the mall carries La Prairie products, the COS Bar.  We stopped in and asked one of the saleswomen in the store, Barbara, about the La Prairie 24 carat gold product.  One of my wisest, oldest, and closet friends who's living the life in London, Davinchi, told me about an interesting experience he had with this particular skin care product which is made in France.  

The product is beautifully encased in a gold cylindrical container that is shaped like a thick, gold-plated, humanoid penis.  Barbara squirted a small amount of the super serum onto the back of our hands.  The serum was clear and viscous.  There were literally tiny, sparkling flecks of gold flakes suspended in the essence that were clearly visible to the naked eye.  Rubbing the serum into my skin with a circular motion, it took a bit of time for it to dissolve thoroughly and to absorb through the outer skin layer.  It left a slightly tacky finish, a slightly golden tinge on my skin, and an earthy, musky fragrance that reminded me of wild vegetation growing in the rainforest.  

Barbara allowed Karen and me to apply a small amount of the product to our faces.  We applied it to the base of our foreheads, cheeks, and nose.  Barbara promised that within a few hours we would notice a significant improvement in our skin hue and condition.

Before leaving the COS Bar, I noticed that the 5 inch, penis shaped, gold plated container only contains 1 fluid ounce of product.  And, the price is $570.  

We walked around the commons for a bit and eventually forgot about the serum on our faces.  But, later that night in my hotel room while brushing my teeth I looked into the mirror at me staring at me and remembered Barbara's promise.  I looked at every detail of my face carefully, every line, ridge, and undulation, searching for improvement.  Everything looked pretty familiar. I sighed. I sighed a heavy sigh of relief.  I guess I wouldn't want to ever be anyone other than me - that's right, me with all my flaws and my imperfect skin.  

I finally noticed that my cheeks seemed to glow in a brighter shade of a golden hue.  But, it was probably because I was happy.

There's no cosmetic that works better than happiness.

Want married men to buy you drinks while shamelessly flirting with you in front of their buddies?  One eye on you, and the other eye on basketball bets they can't afford to lose?  Come here during March Madness - or any day that ends in a "y."

Of course, our chances of meeting the single guys of our dreams were slightly soiled due to the Miss USA Pageant being held at our Hotel.  Rats!  Gosh darn pretty folk.  Try lounging poolside in a bikini, reading your John Grisham novel, when Miss Tennessee and Miss Georgia approach, block the sun, and ask if the seats beside you are taken in their  "ya'll cain't say no tuh us" drawls.  *suck in stomach? check! stick out arm? check!  feeling like hamburger next to steak? check!*

Since the Planet Hollywood was unable to do a complete overhaul of the Aladdin, they cut a few cost corners.  For example, my Hollywood-themed room had a genie lamp and some crazy swirly carpet.  Same great price and reliable everything - just painted purple and with giant PH symbols everywhere.

But the mall is still there!  There's nothing better than walking down to the lobby in the morning, taking 5 kamikaze shots, and then stumbling around the attached mall and spending the money in your "I'll get fired if my boss reads my Yelp reviews" savings account. 

They had nice ashtrays, which Lindsey and I glamorously threw up in on way to the airport the last morning.  See?  PH brought us a little closer to being Hollywood starlets.  

I look forward to seeing what else has been remodeled - in seven months, when I'm allowed to be within 100 yards of the property.

Spacious!  Seats up to 150 guests.
Nice ambiance with appropriate decors.
3 sinks!  Yes, right in the hallway near the restrooms, so your hands can freshen up before you dig right into your next round cajun yumminess or desserts :)

That pretty much sums up some of the important observations while I was at the newly opened Cravin' Cajun, the latest Louisiana crawfish boils restaurant to open up in Las Vegas.

CC serves the same kind of menu offered by other restaurants in the same category. The seasoning comes in three (possibly four) options: Kiddie Cajun (Lightly seasoned), Cravin's Cajun (the restaurant's signature blend), Lemon Pepper (A Cravin's favorite), and maybe Ravin' Cajun! (their combination of all of their flavors). Then you can further specify the heat levels: Mild, Medium, Hot, Crazy Cravin' Hot.

I tried the shrimp with the Cravin' Cajun (medium) and it was served up in the familiar plastic bag over white butcher paper covered table.  And I really enjoyed the flavor of the Cravin' Cajun blend.  I also normally wear a pair of disposable plastic glove when eating this kind of food, but opted to go all natural today, and the shrimps were still piping hot. Wearing disposable gloves may help prevent your sensitive fingertips from getting burned, plus your hands will not required the through soap and hot water treatment afterward.

Not into seafood served in a bag?  They also have Cravin' Cajun Baskets of Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Catfish, Fried Oyster, and Fried Shrimp served Fries.  Cravin' a Po-Boy?  They have Catfish, Crawfish Tail, Oyster, Shrimp and Cajun Sausage Po-Boys to satisfy your tummy. Still not interested???  How about their signature Etouffe, Jambalaya, Gumbo, Seafood Salad, Corn n' Crab Chowder or Lobster Bisque? They serve just about everything you could think of to order here, EXCEPT Fried Okras (Sorry Misti).

Anyway, I plan to come back for dinner and try other stuff on their menu when I am more hungry.

And in case you do not know where this soon to be popular Cajun crawfish/shrimp/crab/clams boil dining destination is located at, it is in the same strip mall as a few other local Yelp favorites (China Mama, HK Star) on S. Jone Blvd, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Rd.

Service was good.  The waitress (Myrene)  was attentative, without breating down your neck. Although I would not object to that in a different setting.

Price is on par with the others. $9.99 for 1# of crawfish, $10.99 for shrimp, etc.

Ambiance is pleasant, interior design work that went into the construction of this restaurant is nicely thought out (3 hand sinks!) and elegantly executed.

4 stars! Yay! I'm a fan, and I will ask friends to come along later tonight :)

OUTSTANDING seafood.

"That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend

"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response.

"Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues.

"Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced.

"What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice.

"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin".

"I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.

Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.

So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.

The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.

Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.

This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.

Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.

On my last trip to Vegas I was trying to find stuff to do that is fun and cheaper than gambling. Additionally this is a non profit place so its tax deductable LOL seriously! 
In an attempt to limit my time spent on slot machines and card tables, I yelped some alternate things to do for fun and found this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=YO2XeytGnySkqj0MRiwuyg#nS2C-9-m1bWaMhm8qvb8aA

Ok so curiosity killed the cat but I had to find out what this was all about. And let me tell ya this place is a gold mine of goodies that has something for everyone.

The place has a huge display of all sorts of things pertaining to sexuality from brutal stone tribal deflowering tools to vintage sexual stimulators to modern day sex toys. 

There are tributes to modern day sexual pioneers like Hefner and Flynt as well as homage to todays porn actors and actresses.

The art collection upstairs (sorry no pics) has some truely amazing works of art and photography, including a fantastic vagina picture picture collection (Petals) that runs along a complete wall and highlights both beauty and contrast. Ever seen a 4 foot golden penis? Minature carved ivory Japanese sex idols? 

And hey the gay community is not left out, there are vintage films, book collections and some beautiful lesbian erotica paintings.

There was an interesting collection of newspaper clippings highlighting the continual run ins our polititions, clergy, and public figures have with the law.

This would be a great spot for a date night ... really. And if your date goes really, really, really well they have a special wedding chapel/honeymoon deal they rent out. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#DG3AFR9MNLcoZxxBQisVPQ

They have a small gift shop and a private library for students. This is a pretty cool place I'd visit again. They even have the Yelp sticker of approval on the door. And I owe this cool discovery to my VBC Canadian friend Yvonne F. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#QiNoFi8JAQJ1Lfv4G4hAJA

Secretly I have been wanting to try Republic Ramen for many months, but the fact that I am not a soup person keep me from it, but after a little adventure with Ramen not too long ago, it left me craving for some more! So I thought what a perfect time to try Republic Ramen & Noodles, and I made my way there.

It was around 4:45 on a cool wed evening the place wasn't too busy, what I didn't realize was this was sort of a fast food type of place, as soon as you walk in you see the menu to order off of. After checking it out, I went with Chili Pepper Ramen, soy sauce based infused with Thai Chili pepper, bell pepper & roasted garlic and it comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions, carrots & your choice of pork, tofu, spam, chicken or beef. I went with beef, I placed my order then took my seat to wait for it! You can add other items to your ramen at a low price, but since this was my 1st time I just went with the items already included 

The soup came out, and I have to say it smelt soo good, and the flavor of the broth was good, but not spicy enough for me, but I added some sriracha and we were in business! I like that they use locally grown veggies and you can tell they are fresh, the spinach was perfect! Next time I will add more veggies to my ramen. The only thing that I didn't care for in the ramen was the beef itself, it was a thick slices of beef that was tough, like a tough roast, I didn't care for it, maybe next time I will just skip adding any type of meat at all, if I go back but it's a big bowl of ramen, and the broth was delish

I read all the good reviews for this place so I thought I would give it a try.
My friend lives close, so I said I will meet you there.
To see it, you would never think ,oh this place will be great.
It is in a strange shopping center. Right next to Chino Bandito,or something like that. Though I must try that place one day as well.
When you walk in it smells divine!
My friend was already there and had ordered an Ice Tea.
She ended up getting the Chicken lettuce wraps, and I the Gryo dish,which is on a bed of fantastic rice.
We each got the chicken Potato soup. Oh my gosh, everything was fantastic! 
Plus we even got pita bread and they were nice enough to give me hot tea,even though it is not on the menu.
I even got 2 Baklava's to go. Which we had for dessert that night.
So glad I read the reviews or I never would of known about this place.
It is very clean as well, with nice clean rest rooms and lots of parking.

When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. 

Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. 

The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook 
Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. 

All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) 

Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. 

I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.

Thanks Denny's for saving my night.

What a let down this place was.

Can an establishment have a classier name?

I'm not sure if I should be writing a review for this place, or a review for my awesome wife that actually let me bring her here. Every vacation we go on some excursion, whether it be cave diving, zip-lining, dune buggys, etc. well in Montreal they don't have a lot of these things to choose from, but what they do have a lot of is kink, so this became our Montreal adventure. 

It took a lot of wine beforehand to convince my wife to walk up the seedy stairwell to the second floor, but she eventually mustered the blood alcohol level to pull it off. When the door upstairs opened we were greeted by two girls wearing nothing but their bras, okay I'm thinking, this is already a good time!

So you pay a fee to get in which basically covers entry, a private room, a couple free beers, and your choice of dancer. I was surprised when the lady we chose told us her name was "Mercedes". I thought surely outside the US these girls could get more creative with their stripper names, but I guess that's a global stereotype.

All I will give away is that it was an experience neither of us will forget, and we left both satisfied and probably a little embarrassed. It was a lot of fun and the girl we chose was very nice and made the whole experience comfortable. The owner was also really cool so feel free to call ahead like we did if you have any questions.

If you are looking for an experience outside the repetitive mechanics of a strip club, or the limitations we have here in the states, then this is the place to go.

Guy, I love you on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' and all. But you rave about every place you go to. And you go to a lot of places. That makes you not very credible in my book.

Since I already had breakfast at the hotel, I wanted something small to nibble on while the other girls ate. But then the PB&J french toast on the menu caught my eye. Mental image of thick toast with swirls of peanut butter and syrup-like jam with powdered sugar. I couldn't resist ordering!

The server later informed me that they only have half an order of the french toast and asked whether I wanted a half order of something else. Since I wasn't hungry, I told her that the half order is fine. But at the same time I was wondering how on earth do they only have half an order. Did they run out of bread??

One by one my friends' orders arrived. Big plates of hearty looking food. Then mine arrived, on a dinky plate. Sitting there in loneliness and despair. 

PB&J French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=FTpZP-NSq5VuEXC_S73C6w): Are you friggin kidding me?! This is like a Smuckers Uncrustable! Not french toast! (http://uncrustableforschools.com/showimage.asp?fileid=2178) Angry! Was not tasty and didn't finish it. I made sure that I did not have to pay full price for this. Luckily, they took the whole item off the bill.

Smoked Salmon & Mushroom Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=7IF34zeAOIegxtukbZle-A): Huge! The tatertots were good. But unfortunately, the omelet itself was dry. The smoked salmon was overly salty.

The Over Easy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=mngAq_ySH-uFP-GVVQdS_g): Their version of eggs florentine. Didn't try it, but looked good.

Brioche French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=gXPle1ZaQQgd8xSRZaFsew): If my french toast looked anything like that I would've been less pissed.

Cool place. Nice staff. Mediocre food.

There's more to Vegas than the Strip.  

I recently spent two weeks at the JW Marriott Las Vegas Spa & Golf  Resort.  Located in Summerlin, the luxury hotel is less than a half an hour's drive from the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard.  If you yearn for the neon of the Strip, take advantage of the complimentary shuttle to/from the Fashion Show Mall, across from The Wynn.  

Otherwise, enjoy the elegantly manicured 50 acre property complete with spa, buffet & casino.  & a mini-24 hour Starbucks!  As you know, the gambling never stops.  You may run out of betting chips, but you'll never be deprived of caffeine...  As long as you keep your coffee card preloaded.  

I stayed in one of the hotel's Estate Suites: Large bedroom, walk-in closet, 1.5 bathrooms & a separate living space with wet bar.  The terrace stretched the length of my unit on the 6th (top) floor.  

Although there is a $10 charge for every 24 hour cycle of Internet access in-room, it's a much better deal than the $5 fee for 15 minutes on the ONE COMPUTER in the Business Center.  Bring your laptop!  Ethernet & telephone cords are provided.

Surprisingly, the fitness rooms offer more than 1 treadmill & 1 set of free weights.  The equipment is clean, presumably because it is rarely used.  Everyone seemed to be indulging in sin instead of exercise.  I, of course, am among the guilty.  I just visited briefly out of curiosity.

4.25 stars -- Overall a great place, but I had some problems with service, clogged drains & FLIMSY ear swabs.  I despise wussy ear swabs!!

Check out my photos for more about the entire resort...  
I will also be writing additional reviews for the spa, buffet, pool, etc.

This review is NSFW (Not Safe For Work). You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.

Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. "Dangerous curves ahead" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)

The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.

***I do not think the pastries and desserts at Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie are worth the high prices, but it still one to consider if you are on the hunt for fancy-looking desserts (I haven't loved anything here yet, but there are some good items)***

Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie has a very attractive display of pastries and individual desserts.  Located right next to the casino, this stand is very versatile.  You can pick up breakfast pastries or individual cakes, but you can also get cafe-esque breakfast items and sandwiches.  They also have a gelato bar as well as a selection of expensive but nice looking packaged sweets (for gifts).

I had a few things.  I tried their pain au chocolat, which was very flaky and crispy.  The chocolate flavor was good though the chocolate bar inside the croissant was too hard.

I also had one of their parfaits, which was gingerbread gelato mixed with hazelnut gelato and then garnished with crunchy hazelnuts and spice-flavored gingerbread.  The parfait was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.

The parfait was just okay.  The gelato was a little too thick (the whipped cream was also not that great; too similar in consistency to a canned whipped cream though I believe this one was fresh).  Also, while the parfait had a good flavor, I felt there was too much gingerbread in it (and the gingerbread was dense).

Service is not rude or lazy here, but it is consistently slow.  I think part of it is due to a lack of staff.  I also do not think it is the most organized spot.  Another issue is that the staff does not seem to notice when a line is building or when customers have been waiting long.

Prices are very high, but it is Las Vegas.  Still, the pastries and desserts here could definitely be better (especially when considering that some of their more ambitious items can run up to $6-$8 each).

Jean Philippe Patisserie is definitely overpriced, but you can walk away with a good pastry or dessert here.  I have not found anything here that I absolutely loved, but there are enough decent things where it might be worth checking out if you are in Aria and on the hunt for a fancy dessert.

Aria has its own parking structure, which is free.  Valet parking is also available.

THIS IS NOW CALLED TOTTIE'S ASIAN FUSION. SAME FABULOUS OWNERS. EXPANDED DIGS. MORE SUSHI. Can't wait to check it out!

Bland strip mall location does not equal bland experience. Do not be leary of an Asian restaurant that covers Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Normally that would scare me off. The room is full of well kept plants and the obligatory bamboo plants. The staff is uber friendly. This is probably due to the owners who go out of their way to know regulars names. I hadn't been there in months and Tottie remembered both me and my partners names. 
You MUST have the Tottie Spring Rolls....perfectly fried thin skinned yet plumply filled rolls served with large leaves of lettuce, fresh mint and cilantro along with fish sauce. The cool of the produce with the hot of the roll is so yummy I eat four and my partner eats four. 
I love the Thai section so far. I don't remember the name of what I've ordered recently but it had the best "fun" noodles with veggies and chicken....dee lish!
The owner/chef checks on tables, is a dee lite and extremely personable lady. The menu is large and deserves exploring. Also a must order is an appetizer of chicken served over a fire with sugar sticks. Unreal. 
This is truly a warm and loving place.

I really love winding down a long night out and about on the town at Gentleman's clubs. My last trip staying out way too late (the kind where sunglasses are needed), my girlfriends and I found ourselves here. Usually, a male is needed in every group to enter and there is a cover; thankfully, my friend knows the manager, we were able to enter as an all girl group, no cover, and he bought our first round of cocktails. 

My friends and I found a lovely cushiony table by the main stage, perused the menu, ordered some food, and chatted with a lot of the ladies. Most of which were just hoping for some conversation at 7 AM on an late Thursday night/early Friday. 

I really fancy CH3 and was a bit bummed when my friends out voted me to come here, but it was a pleasant surprise. The Rhino is very dimmly lit, I even tripped over a few chairs. The club had an old boy's club kind of feel. I felt like I should be drinking a whiskey neat and purchasing a cigar and all the men should be lounging around in robes.

The girls were stunningly gorgeous. I didn't feel they were overally aggressive and quite a few of them came over and sat next to me and my friends and loved having general chit-chat. My favorite was a the entertainer named Vanilla. She was sweet, all-natural (I don't like anchor scars or other silicone parts). I definitely could watch her dance for hours.

I definitely loved The Rhino and will be back. It's definitely classier than CH3, but I like my girls a little dirty.

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

I hike this almost every day. Obviously, I love it. I take no breaks. Prisoners, maybe. 

Here's what you need to know:

Parking can be tricky. If you're going at peak times (get it?), the lot at the trail head is usually full and there's typically a line. It's funny how I'll hike with vigor but I hate walking to the hike. Anyway, it's the second lot you come to and the first on the left. 

The hike gets harder the higher you get. 

There's really very little danger of "falling off the mountain."

Plenty of spots to stop and rest. 

Bring water. Summer or winter, the rescues are almost always someone who is not acclimated to the heat and thinks they can hike for just a bit. Don't do it. 

Drink water before you go. The more the better. 

I strongly recommend hiking boots, or just be super careful on the way down. It's super easy to roll an ankle. 

You know when you get to the two metal hand bars YOU'RE ALMOST THERE! 

Good luck and god speed!

"Secret Pizza" is not the name of this pizzeria.  It actually has no name, but Secret Pizza will suffice for now.

It should be obvious by now that Secret Pizza is probably the worst-kept secret in Las Vegas.  Since everyone knows where it is already, I'll just go ahead and spill the beans -- Cosmopolitan hotel, third floor, tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, down the short corridor lined with vintage album covers.

Okay, now that I said it, don't kill me, please?  This isn't Fight Club, right?

I wasn't joking when I said everyone knows about Secret Pizza already.  The lines to eat here are obscene.  It's most popular in the middle of the night, when the post-Marquee crowd drops by to feed their drunken munchies.  However, when a group of us dropped by at 2pm in the afternoon, we still had to wait over 30 minutes just to reach the cashier.  

Not that I minded waiting.  I could spend hours looking at the collection of vintage albums.  There's also pinball.  The pizzeria itself is decked out in gleaming white subway tile, in fitting with the New York theme.

We shared a variety of red slices, some plastic cups of PBR, and a slice of cheesecake.  While the pizza was fresh and delicious, it was doused in enough grease to make the paper plate translucent in no time.  (Remember that episode of the Simpsons when Bart rubs his pizza on the wall and then the wall turns clear?  Yeah, like that.)  There is barely any seating inside the pizzeria, so we carried all of the grub to the lounge area outside.

At $5 a slice, it's expensive, but not unreasonably so.  A better deal is ordering a whole pie.  I recommend that if everyone in your group can agree on a single topping.

All in all, Secret Pizza is a solid place to go -- if for no other reason than being able to help all the other confused tourists who are curious to find out where you got your pizza and beer from.  :-)

This event was held at La Grand Orange.  This was an easy location to go to for shopping for me.  I go to LGO often enough and love their cookies.  I arrived at 5:30 on the dot.  Yelp had a table setup for "shoppers" who checked-in to pick-up their check-in offer sweet treat - for me, it was the mini-red-velvet cupcake.  I dropped off my cleaning supplies that I purchased for the Ronald McDonald House at the table.  We also received a sweet ticket to get a cup of hot chocolate and an invitation to try out the new restaurant in the LGO family that is located across the street.

I ordered food and sat in the dining room.  I ate dinner and then went back to check out the offerings that LGO has.  I previously wrote a review about LGO.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:gx2aCOeK4UAv7h2_jBB3Ag

Besides the food (salads, sammies, desserts), you can get an eclectic variety of games, coffee mugs and various other trinkets in the store.  Here are the links to the pics I took of the things in their store a few months ago.

I enjoy shopping local.  I co-organize a supper club UYE that almost exclusively supports locally owned restaurants and I usually eat at local places.  When I can, I do like to give my business to locally owned farmers and grocers.  Thanks to Lindsey and LGO for the invite to join. I am hopeful that next week's shop local will introduce me to more stores in the Phoenix area that interest me.

My husband and I have been here several times already and like this place. We have always been greeted promptly at the door & seated quickly. We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things. 
The food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh & crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it. 
In the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders & mozzarella sticks were all a big hit.  
One of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water. 
As far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size. 
Being this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time.

I thought I'd treat my man to Sensi because we're both represented on the menu. They've got a little bit of Italian, a little bit of Asian, and a little bit of American. Oh, and they've got seafood too, which we both love.

While everything on the menu sounded amazing, we decided to go for the pan roasted halibut and Sensi's braised beef short ribs. Presentation was beautiful, but I wasn't completely blown away. For $$$$, I was expecting to have the best foodgasm ever, but I didn't even have one. 

Service was top notch, and everything else about this place was exquisite. And what a gorgeous place! The open kitchen is the center of attention here. We were seated near the lobster tank, but thankfully, I didn't see or hear any lobsters being cooked. 

If I come back again, I'll give their prix-fixe menu a try. Seems that would be the best way to go here.

There's nothing else like this in Las Vegas and you should go now because who knows if they'll be able to sustain the air of coolness (hope!) it has once everyone knows.  If you combined the whole craft cocktail scene that's emerged in the last few years, off kilter shows like "Absinthe", the lurking human oddity stuff that's popped up at some club spots and the fucking jadedness to the $3k bottle service/fist pump crowd, Rose.Rabbit.Lie is like a culmination of all of this and seems so right for right now.  It's really refreshing!  There was also this whole underlying "Eyes Wide Shut" feel to the whole thing in a good way.   

Thanks to Edwin P, my wife and I were able see the 8pm show of "Vegas Nocturne".  I won't go into any details of the show but I thought it was terrific.  This is what I imagine vaudeville shows were like but with some added modern nuances.  If you liked Absinthe, you will like this.    

We hung out for a while in their "music room" which was fantastic.  I am not sure what genre to technically call the band but it was like an old school New Orleans band with horns playing modern hits.  One of the funniest performers in "Vegas Nocturne" belted out a psycho version of "Blurred Lines" that had everyone on their feet.  There were some really unique performers after her too.  

I had a chance to look at the dinner menu which looked great.  We definitely plan on doing that soon.  Caviar tacos, foie gras, steak and some really interesting dishes I fail to remember due to the cocktails.  Can't wait to go back!

After having such a wonderful experience here with my cat a couple of years ago, I was incredibly disappointed with the treatment we got last April when my border collie, Queen, got sick.
They found a mass bigger than a grapefruit on her spleen.  She was so lethargic, I couldn't walk her around the block.  That was so unusual for her, especially with her breed.  This was a dog I could take on 10-hour hikes in the White Tanks and she'd still be ready for more.
I was told I could have her go through surgery and that if it wasn't cancer, she could have a year more to live.  Keep in mind, Queen was 12.  Ripe age for a very active dog.  If it was cancer (it would take two weeks to find out), she could go through chemo and have another 6 months to live.
I didn't feel that surgery or chemo were something that a) would give her the quality of life she had lived thus far b) was something I could afford or c) the best decision for her health.
I took her home (it was a Friday night) and decided to have her put to sleep the next day.  When I got up Saturday morning to let them know I would be in, it took about 10 minutes for them to call me back.  In fact, it was the actual vet calling, trying to talk me out of the humane treatment for Queen, and trying to talk me into spending time, money and emotional stress on my dog, just to have her for another year.  Selfish.  I couldn't bear to have her sick at ALL any longer.  He pushed a little more, and I informed him I would be in as soon as my Mom arrived from Payson to go through it all with me.
I felt like the care they were giving was more financially-based than humane.  
I'll never take any of my animals here again.

If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  It's also very loud (I went during lunch hours), and you're most likely going to have to wait, unless you come during the tail-end of lunch.  (There's a sign posted on the wall by the door that stated to the effect that for those customers who did not want to or could not wait, then please visit Narai Thai and Sushi down a few doors.  To some people, it might come off as abrupt, and even slightly rude, but I thought that was generous of Thai House to post...  Both places are good, and Narai Thai has atmosphere.)   What you will find are a great Chicken panang http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#x0sI8WU7hgYveO5nGEFk1A and a terrific bowl of Curry noodles!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#RDHeNq9Ld9h5-6imL9WDRg  The curries here are rich and very silky-- just how I prefer them!  The Thai iced tea I had was also very, very good (not too sweet).  What I didn't like was that the lunch specials only featured the entree and your choice of soup/salad and steamed white/fried rice.  No egg roll.  Probably a healthier option, but still... :(  I didn't care for the salad dressing, a sweet vinaigrette.  Next time, I'm going to specify dry.  

What really sealed the deal here for me was the service!  I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items!

I had high hopes. Obama is our president...the Cardnials are one win away from the super bowl....things are looking good. 

I would have to say that Fuego didn't live up to the expectations. The prices are a bit high (20$ per plate) for the style of the place (casual) and for the food itself. It was good, but not great. 

We had the empanadas. Interesting...but try them at Mi Cocina Mi Pais (great!). Fuego's are good...but too much pastry...and a sauce that tasted like a wing sauce (like would be great on hot wings but overwhelmed the empanadas). 

The drinks were good but again not amazing. Mismatched glasses and plates (I mean that is sort of cute, but not for a nice dinner out).

The Ropa and the Pernil were good. The corn was ok (not enough flavor) and the mashed potatoes were overpowered with chipotle flavor (which I usually like)

Everyone was nice. Our server was a little too familar...but whatever. There was this really sad folksy music playing. For a cuban/latin place, get some freaking latin cuban music.   The music made the whole vibe a bit odd.  I felt I should go get high afterwards and think about the sadness in this world...:)   But (my wife is making me say this)...the singer was talented. Keep up the good work buddy, maybe at a different venue.

Overall, it was ok. Not worth the drive and probably won't be coming back. With so many other great places in PHX, this one needs some fine tunning to be amoung the list.

China Pantry is located in the food court of the Las Vegas Premium outlets. Right in the middle of a busy shopping spree with my cousins, I found myself ordering a three item combo to share from here. For a little under $8, I got a combo with fried rice, noodles, chicken teriyaki, chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms. 

Pros: 
It was a decent amount of food! They don't really give a lot but it is enough to get you decently full. 

The chicken teriyaki was nice and lean! There was a good amount of chicken in the chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms (meaning it wasn't all veggies).

Taste wise the food was pretty good. The chicken dishes were flavorful! The curry sauce was good. The teriyaki was just the right amount of sweet! 

Cons: 
I didn't order anything to drink but did ask for water. The lady working there gave me a cup of water and when I asked for another (since I was sharing this meal), she said only one water per customer :(.

It's an OK place. A little bit pricey which is to be expected since it is at a food court at a popular outlet.

Creeping senility: I thought I'd reviewed this place in 2005. The public area is probably about 600 square feet, but every inch is jammed with Fertile Crescent / Mediterranean goodness.

This is a bakery, restaurant, and grocery. The restaurant part of the operation has a an extensive menu of flesh-based and vegetarian options. There are plates, salads, and sandwiches. The plates (kebabs, gyros, etc,.) usually come with a decadent rice pilaf, your choice of tabbouleh or Greek salad, and tsatsiki. There are a few grilled chicken dishes, and the chicken is always moist with a nice char.

MEB&D also bottles its own spices. Not as diverse as Penzey's, but it's nice to have an option on 16th St. Hat tip to Adam M. on the olives -- they're delicious.

Dessert? They serve different forms of baklava, turkish coffee, and homemade halvah (they'll slice off a piece with a scimitar-looking blade for a sample -- impress your friends!).

Tips:
- You can buy Greek tobacco soap.
- The soup of the day is always avgolemono. It always will be until the mountains crumble and our love is through. Sometimes there's an excellent red lentil as a second option. 
- They have great par-cooked or reheatable stuff  -- it's in the frozen section.
- MEB&D is an effective and affordable option to cater a party on short notice (I've done this).

IMO the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The components are all four-star, but the place gets the fifth for the "park-once, enjoy-many" experience.

I was fortunate enough to spend my NYE with the extremely talented and greatest eye candy of all, John Legend. I found out he was playing at The Pearl for NYE, I informed my girlfriends and we were all in for a NYE with John Legend!!! 

We decided to go all out and got 5th row middle seats...I'm pretty much broke now, but it sounded like a good idea at the time. And looking back at how much fun I had, it was worth every penny to see John Legend up close and personal! 

The venue itself, fantastic! Located inside The Palms Hotel....smaller more intimate setting, and from looking around a really great view from wherever you sit. The bars outside had limited selection of liquor and beer, but the bartenders are super nice and will try to mix you up something yummy with what they have. 

The acoustics were great, Johnny sounded fantastic, and I sang duets with him throughout the evening....Love that man.

As we walked out of the venue, there were people passing out hats, crowns,  beads and noisemakers for NYE, we had just enough time to get to the bar to grab some drinks and have a view from our suite of the fireworks on strip. NYE + John Legend + Fireworks = HAPPINESS!!

When I'm at the New York, New York Hotel & Casino, I use to always walk by Gallagher's Steakhouse and marvel at the row of rib eyes that dropped along the top of their dry-age coolers. I promised myself that the next time I return, I'll throw a ridiculous bet on the hardway's with a couple of black chips in hopes the dice will hit the 10-1.  Haha, well don't get too excited cause it didn't happen, yet, that is...BUT instead I scored something just as good as I was kidnapped to celebrate a quick birthday overnighter in Sin City and to finally try one of Gallagher's steaks. 

So why this place...?
Dry-Aged beef is what we're talkin' bout peeps...that's right, not sticking a piece of meat in a vacuum-sealed bag that apparently also "ages" faster and in hopes to trim and reduce its water weight, hence the controversy of why very many steakhouses don't use the classical dry-aged process. As we all know time is money. Catch my drift...? 

At Gallagher's, its old school "aging'...We're talking countless hours and days of beef being stored in a special dry-aging cooler where a complex chemical reaction process that involves an intricate equilibrium of time, temperature, and the right humidity so that the beef's enzymes begins to break down and tenderize the meat. In return, Gallagher's delivers to you one of the utmost tender and most flavorful steak you'll ever eat. BOOM! 

The Eats:
Main Course:
Dry-Aged New York Sirloin $43 
Cowboy Rib-Eye Steak $45     slightly burnt edges (-.5)
Sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Carmelized Onions $2 each
Yukon Gold Potato Puree $8  meh. (-.5)

Ambiance:
Dim lighting, tranquil noise level, semi-formal attire (Sported a Hawaiian shirt =P)

Customer Service:
Product Knowledgeable, Friendly and Professional.

Tip: Make reservations. Its packed!

Peace!

Review:
As a fan of The Deli, I was excited to try this place and it did not disappoint.  The Bistro, although currently a little difficult to find due to lack of real signage, is a cute and trendy little bistro with a great selection of drinks and good options for breakfast and lunch.  If you're familiar with the Deli's signature carrot cake, good news, they offer it here too!  The cashier caught me drooling and immediately knew why, so obviously I'm not the only fan.

My hubby ordered the special of the day which was frozen berry iced tea and a loaded bagel breakfast sandwich with turkey,egg, cheese, and pesto...both were tasty!  I got the chai latte with vanilla, and though my latte was a little sweet for my taste, they were happy to adjust it to my liking (I tend to like less sugar, no fault of the drink).  I also got the quiche which came with a salad for $5, great deal!

I give this place a 5 because for the location, locally produced food/teas, drink selection, ambiance, and friendly staff, it is a place I will definitely come back to.  They also have free wi-fi, maybe my next Yelp review will be written there over another one of their delicious drinks!

When it comes to fine dining restaurants Las Vegas can compete with any city. But, what the city lacks (with the exception of Chinatown/Spring Mountain Rd.) is casual, moderately-priced dining spots with excellent food. Hops and Harvest fills that void with Bradley and Bryan Ogden's farm to table concept. 

The James Beard award winning chef and his son have created a menu full of comfort food with inspired and creative touches like the goat cheese stuffed crepe in the bibb lettuce salad and brought back  items from their former restaurant in Caesars Palace like the blue corn muffins and the Maytag bleu cheese souffle.

The short rib nachos are one of my favorite dishes with its great salty and savory flavors. The potato chips do tend to get a little soggy with the sauce  covering them, but the combo of ingredients are so good that the dish won't last long. The pork belly bites are another hit with its sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and cheddar ale sauce. I've tried both the tuna sliders and the crispy chicken sliders and wasn't disappointed either time. The heirloom tomatoes may be a small dish but the combo of tomatoes and bleu cheese was excellent.

The bone-in prime rib eye was slightly overcooked but the seasoning and the zinfandel shallot sauce made up for it. I rarely order meatloaf, but the bacon wrapped version here was good enough to make me want to order it again. I've also tried the crab cake dish, which was pretty good, but the star of that dish was the carrot-fennel slaw. It was so good they should offer that up as one of their sides on the menu.

The butterscotch pudding and the cinnamon sugar donut holes were both good. Each one is large enough for two people to share.

There were only a couple things I wasn't crazy about. The blue corn muffins could have used more salt or something and the polenta bites were bland.

Our server, Jessica, was amazing. Each time I've been back I made a point to request a table in her section.

I was sad to see Bradley Ogden's place in Caesars Palace close a while back, but now I'm glad he's back and serving up some Strip-quality food in a local's setting.

If ever there was a culinary god, his name would be Joel Robuchon. 

This guy is a freaking genius. I bow down to him.

My BF and I came here the other night and boy were we glad. We didn't get the tasting menu since we stuffed our faces the night before at Michael Mina. 

We opted for a la carte items and were very satisfied with our choices. 
-------

Started off with an amuse buche of foie gras with cheese foam in a shooter glass. Effen amazing! I never knew foie gras could taste so good. 

Foie gras ravioli in warm chicken broth with herbs was my favorite dish of the evening. Tiny pockets of delightfulness all wrapped up. OMFG. I am still dreaming of them. 

Maine lobster in spicy broth shaved lime and corn was delicious as well. I liked the kick it had, but then again I like most of my food fiery. This was my BF's fave dish.

L'Atelier style spaghetti was up next and it was quite filling. This was basically spaghetti carbonara and it was creamy, yet not overpowering. I also like the tiny pieces of ham. Very tasty indeed. 

I chose the salmon with crispy potatoes and a side of mashed potatoes for my entree. It was good, but didn't really stand out as the best salmon ever. However, the mashed potatoes were so buttery every single bite I took made me feel my heart thump harder. It's all good, the BF polished them off for me.

He had the foie gras stuffed quail and truffle mashed potatoes and boy was that heavenly! The quail had such great flavor and seriously melted in my mouth. Wow. 

We had 2 glasses each of the German Riesling. Very good as well. 

The service was attentive and knowledgeable as well. 

I absolutely love this place! Dinner was $250 before tip, so make sure you bring someone special! I can't wait to come back. This was simply orgasmic, in the culinary sense.

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

I had seen this food truck at many a Saturday morning market here downtown, but I never paid them much attention.  Then one day I did because I was really hungry and in a rush.  The result was awesomeness!

But the large posted menu is kind of deceiving.  It presents their 4 standard dogs but doesn't fully speak to the uniqueness and deliciousness of their food, nor does it really give you all your options, which are plentiful.  These are some of the things you should know, that you probably won't realize from their menu:

They come on naan fry bread, not buns.
(Though you can request buns, but that would be silly.)
This does not come across on their board anywhere, but it is the foundational magic of their product.

They let you choose your own wiener.
[insert bad joke here]
They have traditional, veggie, bratwurst, and my favorite: beer-hot.  The beer-hot with the naan is the best combo ever!

They have about two-dozen toppings.
You get a hint of this in the descriptions of their standard-four, but it helps a LOT to see the toppings listed out (plus they have some that don't show up on the standard-four).  They have the list up on a small laminate menu by the window.

Their ingredients are mostly local, and some are organic.

I've gotten a beer-hot w/ fresh jalapeos, swiss, cilantro, and red onions; and also a bratwurst w/ sauted onions, sauerkraut, and spicy mustard.

Bottom line is this truck needs more accessible marketing, because they have a GREAT product!

Kj is probably the best dim sum spot in Vegas. I can say that for a fact. After dining here, and other dim sum restaurants in town, Kj is the only one I regularly return to. This also ranks up there with some of my favorite restaurants in the city.

After sitting down, I recommend that everyone orders the hot tea. It's not complimentary, I think it's like 3 or 5 dollars, but it's unlimited refills, and nothing goes better with dim sum than hot tea.

So there are carts rolling around the place that are loaded with goodies that you can just pick and choose which dishes you want. Definitely if you are going here, I would recommend ordering the har gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai, pork bao, and coeng fan (rice noodle rolls). And, save some room for dessert, their egg custard tarts are fantastic, as well as their green tea and taro buns. But, always be open to trying new things, that's the key to dim sum.

Not everything I thought was stellar. First, the XLB or "soup dumplings" are not very appetizing. There is hardly any broth inside, and it's basically all wrapper. And, the char siu baau is pretty average, with it tasting more of sauce, rather than pork. And sometimes another issue I have, not all the dim sum are piping hot, which I feel should be.

Overall, this place is really great, with the positives greatly outnumbering the negatives. Some people have told me that this place is comparable to some of the best dim sum spots in cities that have a large dim sum presence. I believe them because I really like this place, and will continue to come back here!

I'm a fan, indeed. Especially of the fancy schmancy Perrier-Jouet champagne that kept on going and going. So, for those not in the know, this is a Sunday morning only brunch buffet at Ballys, and it comes with quite the pricetag: $85 per person (about $110/person after tax, tip and such). ...and it's by reservation, so you've gotta plan ahead.

And it is pretty fancy schmancy in there. Not in the modern, Wynn/Encore sorta way, but in the 1955 sorta way.. with waiters in white dinner coats and green striped wallpaper. The food selection is supposed to be amazing, and I concur (mostly), it wasn't bad.

Despite what my profile may say about lobster, the lobster here was actually my favorite thing. ...or maybe it was just the butter I doused it in. Either way, it was one tasty dish. I also tried caviar for the first time, and it wasn't bad, but nothin' to write home about. 

There were crab claws, but not crab legs. There's filet mignon that you can get from the tray, but I recommend asking your waiter for them to cook some to order for you. Other than that, I had some delicious lamb chops, a delish pretzel roll and some pretty decent dessert. 

The real highlight is the service. Even though the buffet is self-serve, our waiter was ON it. I never had an empty champagne glass, and he gladly got our filet mignons to order. 

The ultimate test though... would I go again? Nope. It was worth an experience, but I'm pretty sure I'm just as satisfied (and probably because I'm not a huge lobster fan) with the Spice Market or Wynn buffets.

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

Ruben has been wanting to check the improved Gold Spike out for a while, but I've been hesitant - what was there to see? Well, I was wrong! It turns out I've been to Gold Spike during a Superhero Pub Crawl a couple years ago. The only thing recognizable now was the bar! What used to be a casino is now comfortable Love Sacs, modern furniture and decor, a bed, and various games. It's quite the transformation.

After admiring the area, Ruben and I settled down for a few games of Tic Tac Toe with a large version set on one of the tables. As we continued to venture, we discovered shuffleboard (deck version), cornhole, billiards, life-size connect four, and more. We also played a game of connect four, which we really enjoyed!

Another neat feature is an art installation by Miguel Rodriguez. You peer through curtained slots while sitting at a "bar" and it's neon paint and objects against a black backdrop. You may also be able to go inside?

The best part of this newly renovated Gold Spike is definitely the "Backyard" as they've coined it. Complete with synthetic grass, patio furniture, fire pits, additional cornhole games, life-size jenga, life-size beer pong, bullet trailer, and "Cold Spike," their ice skating rink. Admission is $10 and skate rentals are $5, but I read that this is an all-day price like The Cosmopolitan. The rink looked nice and it's large compared to the others in town, however, I heard that it's not really ice! Which makes sense why they haven't shut it down yet and have no plans on closing it for the season until they figure out their next move (the attendant shared that it's possibly being converted into a roller rink). The furniture was rather dirty, so I didn't take the chance of sitting down, but we really enjoyed a game of life-size jenga! Make sure you wear shoes or run quickly when it falls! 

Overall, really cool place to chill with friends and grab a couple drinks. The only mood killer was the smell!! It reeks of bad bathroom freshener that was trying really hard to mask (rather than eliminate) odors, but failed miserably. It was hard to stay inside for a long period of time and you could still smell it while in the Backyard as well, though not as bad.

This place is just okay. It's not horrible, but it's not that great either.

Located inside the Hard Rock, we came here for mid-week lunch during a recent visit. It wasn't very crowded, so we were able to get seated right away.

The chips and salsa were good. They were warm and not too greasy. I enjoyed their salsa. It was a pico with a medium spice. Suitable for any tolerance level.

For my main course I went with the lobster tacos. I think this should just be called lobster with some tortillas. I was expecting actual tacos, but instead I got a lobster tail with beans and rice. The tail itself was a pretty good portion, but there was little flavor to anything else. I did like the fluffiness of their house made tortillas, but again, not worth the $18 price tag and I was still hungry afterwards.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their enchilada dishes, maybe I should have gone that route. But even from looking at them, I don't think they were worth the $12-$15 price tags.

Service was good. We had someone filling up our drinks and checking in on us constantly. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other restaurants in the area that I think are better and worth the money, so I probably wont be back.

I'm not sure how I've gone this long without reviewing "America's Friendliest Airport," but I think it's finally time.  I've been traveling so much lately, that I'm way overdue in writing this review of Phoenix Sky Harbor. I admit, it's a tough one to write though... your experience relies 100% on the airline you're flying, what terminal you're at, and TSA / security.  Of course, it's always nicer when you fly first class or club member level, as you typically get to avoid major lines.

Luckily, I live only about 20 minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor aka PHX.  My favorite terminal is terminal four; it's the newest, easiest to drop-off / pick-up from, it has the most dining options, etc... 

I find the staff at the airport to be friendly overall.  It is easy to navigate through, and we've got clean restrooms and free wifi too (if you're lucky enough to get it to work for you); but there's nothing else that stands out about this airport to make it so unique.  (No really local businesses with a presence in the airport, no extraordinary food vendors, no rocking chairs, etc... and for that reason, I'm giving it a three star rating - A-OK indeed!   

I'll see you again real soon, PHX.  So long for now.

And for anyone counting, this was indeed my 1000th review - :)

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

Suck it up.  I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I love their quirky drink names, the sleek packaging, and how there's more than just boba [gobi poppers and nunu yummies] you can add into the drinks but man do I hate the way they run things!  

This place is always busy and the line spews well past their awkwardly placed pillar and into the rest of the food court.  They should probably utilize some kind of name system or order number because if you're not paying attention, someone can walk away with your drinks.  Two smooch-sized [large] drinks costs about $12 which is like $2 more per drink than any other boba house around the valley but you pay for the convenience of having bubble tea inside a nicer shopping mall.  

Since it's always so busy, their bobas are always soft and chewy --- I dig the freshness.  I'm loving the yogurt gobi poppers.  Explosive!  Another good thing about the place is you can choose what kind of sweetener and creamer for them to use.   Truvia?  Non-dairy creamer?  Yes please!  The menu isn't as large as everyone says but since they did go with a clever naming system, you can't just go, "I want a taro boba."  You would have to comb through the menu and see that it's called a Purple Haze.  This can be a bit confusing but you'll get the hang of it.

Anyways, Boba Tea Company is definitely a trendier bubble tea place and I'll probably come back again and again when I feel like standing around for 15 minutes to order and receive some drinks.  YOGURT GOBI!  WOO!

[You still owe me a drink, Bretters.  I'm putting you on Blast!]

No, honey, you're not in New York, Chicago, or L.A.

See those tanlines on your thighs? Yes, you're in Arizona.

Your backsweat confirms this.

Out of the car, sexy. It's time for lunch.

Nope. Definitely NOT Brooklyn.

NevertheWoodyAllenless, Chompie's does a wonderful Jewish deli impression.

Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.

There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects. Off to the side (not a sideshow so much as it's the main event) is a brightly lit, "don't even think of comparing us to Applebee's" casual, sit-down restaurant. 

Whether gorging at home or in public, Chompie's is your Heavenly, Hebrew enabler in case your "I only eat healthy chick food" waistline has a deathwish.

What a way to go, ho!

- fantastic soups of the day
-  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token 
   offering of lettuce
- sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast 
   hidden somewhere beneath
- gravy, Gravy, GRAVY
- pickles. On EVERYTHING.
- French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your 
   table, or at least one very fat man.
- attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)

The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad. 

And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?

'Sactly.

Oh, and mom called.

She said f*ck your diet.

Yep, I am officially in love with Haute Chix and it has soared up on my list for top clothing stores. 

A few tips: Make sure you follow them on instagram @hautechixvegas to get the first scoop on brand new items and the daily deal.. whether it is 20% off of certain items or certain colors! Very fun idea and I am happy to know that they still care about doing these things to show appreciation for their customers. Word on the street is: alterations here are fairly priced and they come out looking fantastic. Also, check in on Yelp before you checkout ;)

I rushed over here because I fell in love with two dresses posted on their instagram and my trip ended with me snagging up both of them along with some cute accessories. I love that they took the time to wrap my necklaces in tissue paper so it would not end up a tangled mess in my bag. Whenever I am done checking out, I feel like I just gave myself a nice gift. Cute, brown kraft paper bag with my newly purchased goodies inside topped off with tissue paper. It can easily can end up being a gift bag if it is a present for someone.

They have a lot of unique jewelry pieces/clothes that you will not find easily distributed like per se Forever 21. I love shopping here and knowing that you will only be finding my top or outfit on very few other individuals. And again, I must stress that if you love that item, BUY IT! It will most likely be gone before you can even think about it lol.

Happy Hour Review:

We had a nice time at the Culinary Dropout's HH this past Friday. We arrived around four-thirty and the inside bar was pack. The hostess said the HH was limited to the bar area inside and out. Nahhhh we thought, we'll stay inside thank you very much. It was 105 degrees and the outdoor water misters were totally ineffective 

I mentioned in passing that I had read about their HH on Yelp. After checking with her Manager, she came back and offered us one of the communal tables near the stage.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The crowd was a mixture of Millennium's and Gen X'er, along with an equal number of retires.  So eclectic? The interior had that old tin and aluminum stamped walls, reminiscent of the NY in the 1930s, with a large stage.  It also has several large B&W photos from the 1960s of Janis Joplin, The Who, Roy Orbison along with a very young Boss, creating some good Karma.

MENU:
All of the food is $6.00: Grilled cheese sliders; Chopped salad; yummy Korean beef on a stick (photos); Pretzels & Fondue; meatloaf sandwich; Smoked salmon bruschetta, Antipasti and much more.  All beers are $3.00 served in a 12oz mug; most wines are $6.00 and the Well cocktails are $4.00.

SERVICE:
Tom our server was pretty cool and on top of things.  He worked hard at refilling our glasses and had an intimate knowledge of the menu, both HH and regular dinner.  Even though this was HH, there was a focus on the regular menu.

FOOD:
Everything we tried was excellent.  The salad, Fondue and meatloaf sandwich, were all very large. While the Korean Beef on the Stick was very good though it could be larger.  But it too was delicious, and not overly spicy.

PRICES:
As I mentioned the Happy Hour food prices were all $6.00. Our bill came to under $41 including taxes but not gratuities.

Enjoy!

I was a dim sum virgin until yesterday!  My wonderful wife Audrey W was there to share my experience with me as were Dottsy Z, Donald S, Marian and Kevin H.  And Dottsy has pictures too!  And wow did I get off cheap!  

The best dim sum I have ever had!  Honestly, the only dim sum I have ever had!  I'm so glad I had other yelpers that were experienced to share it with and help me enjoy the first time!

Seriously, Phoenix Palace has really good dim sum.  I enjoyed nearly everything I tried, there was tremendous variety and high quality through and through.  I was not quite as adventurous as some of the more experienced folks at the table.  I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasn't ready to go all the way.

The review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.  I don't know but it was good.

For 6 people and loads of food the total was just under $70.  Unreal.

Great lunch spot for dim sumderful variety and a total bargain.  Phoenix Palace is in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so you can fill up on dim sum before you do your shopping.  Then you'll spend less when you go shopping.  Never go shopping hungry.

I'm horrified by my experience today. It. Smelled. Awful!

And here's the thing. Gyms probably naturally smell awful. But it's the staff/gyms job to not let that smell linger. Of course there's going to be sweat, B.O. and God knows what else lingering long past your work out. But I'd think it should be one of the main objectives to keep it smelling fresh, because you'd want to keep people coming in.

But here's the thing. I'm paying for not only the use of the machinery, but also the actual space. Do I want to work out in a place that smells like stale B.O.? No way! I want to work out in a clean, properly air conditioned and comfortable space. None of these things are happening here right now. 

That brings me to my next point. Every summer the place suffers from stale and poorly ventilated air. What does that mean? It's freakin' hot in herre! I'd understand you wouldn't want to work out in an ice box. But this isn't a sauna either. It's awful and you can tell it's not supposed to that way. 

I'll leave you with this final fact. I hopped on the elliptical today and there was gum on the front part where you'd put your cell phone. Seriously?? That's rude for the person that did that, but rude that no one would clean that up. I'm honestly disgusted at this point. 

I hope they clean up their act (literally) or I may take my sweat somewhere else that does a better job masking it.

While waiting for my daughter to finish a magic the gathering tournament at the nearby Little Shop of Magic, I wandered into Carlos' Kitchen and the connected Spectator's bar  I will review Specator's separately.

The menu in both locations is supplied by Carlos.  Carlos is a former instructor at Le Cordon Bleu and I am glad he came out to discuss Burger philosophy and general cooking techniques with me.  He truly loves the art of cooking and I enjoyed meeting him.

I started with onion rings which were lightly battered and fried to a golden glow.  The batter was unlike other batters as it had a sweetness to it.  I followed the rings with a bacon cheddar burger.  Now I have been searching for a truly great burger since I moved here.  I ordered the burger medium (I knew I was in for a treat as most places don't even ask).  The burger was perfectly cooked Angus beef with just the right amount of pink without being undercooked.  Carlos takes pride in the quality and flavor of the meat and it shows.  The bun was crisp on the outside and soft inside and the cheese was melted so it covered the top and sides but didn't fall out onto your hands.

This is one of the best burgers in the area and the price is right.  Burger, fries and onion ring appetizer cost me only $17.00.

I can't wait to come back and sample some of Carlos' other creations.  This is a diamond in the rough.  Don't miss your chance to meet Carlos!

Walking in though the Doc Holliday's door I didn't really know what to expect when I stepped in Maribel's Kitchen. The restaurant was a little larger than I was expecting and the server approached us immediately for our drink order and we put in an order for guacamole while we looked over the menu.

They have daily specials that all looked amazing. Since it was Tuesday, we both opted for the carne asada tacos special. This comes with three tacos, rice, beans and a drink, all for the low price of $5. How amazing is that. The rest of the menu was extensive and had good prices as well.

Our guacamole arrived and it was heaven in a bowl. Big chunks of avocado and not overly blended, I couldn't get enough. I tried to be a lady, but I really wanted to eat it by the spoonful. For $3.99, it was a great value and the portion was enormous.

Our tacos came out and I was even more amazed. Everything tasted great and I was stuffed and very happy by the end of my meal. 

Service was attentive and refills were plentiful. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu and, of course, to order more guacamole.

What a snazzy addition to a tired business building in Scottsdale! Before the arrival of Searsucker, I drove by this building on a daily basis and never gave it second thought. However, now everyday I drive by, it makes me want to stop into Searsucker because I am meow a fan!! 

First, I love the atmosphere. They completely opened up the ceiling with sky scrapers placed throughout the restaurant. In addition to the sky scrapers, trees grace floorboards which make it feel like an indoor garden. The furniture's modern and earthy which matches the fresh vibe. You can see the chefs making the food in the kitchen and an open bar area holds comfortable couches as well as high tops. It's very fresh and airy for being inside a corporate building! 

Now let's move on to the food, oh my the food! I can only review the lunch menu since I've only been for lunch, but if the dinner menu's anything like lunch, then I'm a fan. My two menu highlights are the Havarti turkey sandwich and the delectable chocolate caramel peanut bacon sundae! That might not be the correct name, but that's how I like to describe it! The Havarti Turkey sandwich has freshly roasted turkey with a cranberry jam, sprouts and fresh cracked wheat bread. It's accompanied by a salad and a perfectly fresh lunch. 

I enjoy a leisurely lunch at Searsucker and especially enjoy their delicious craft cocktails at night!

Visit 8/14/12

This little popcorn shop is located on the Eastern Ave corridor between Silverado Ranch and Serene. It's near BJ's and East Ocean. Parking is ok but can get crazy.

There's a lot of food and dessert options in the area. This store has a great modern style decor and good vibe.

I stopped in right before they were ready to close but no problem, the staff was friendly and not even trying to rush us. Plus they let you sample anything and try what looks good.
If you have tried it do the pickle flavor popcorn cuz it's just oddly a cool taste.and you'll buy it aftre the taste settles. I LOVE NEW STUFF!

The store has very good displays of the actual products which is good to visualize. Plus menu boards and easy to understand descriptions and prices.

Prices a little high if you just say I'm getting popcorn, but worth it.

All around great experience and good small business.

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

If you've been looking for the best kept secret in Phoenix, this isn't really you're place, cause it's not that much of a secret anymore. If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory caf here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!

I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)

Happy Yelping Phoenix, be sure to put this on your bucket list for Phoenix if you haven't been yet!

I'v been watching Cake Boss for years now and after my experiences at Carlo's Bake Shop I have come to the conclusion that Buddy and the Bakery is a case of a TV show making things look way better than they actually are. One thing I noticed from the show is that Buddy excels at making Cakes LOOK amazing but have you noticed everything is produced from sheet cake? There's no real skill at baking a sheet cake, even my 4 year old Niece can do that.

Visiting on a Tuesday evening the Bakery wasn't as busy as I expected so if you don't want to wait long this is the time to come!
The ordering system is all over the place and there are three, yes THREE lines for the whole ordering process:

1. Line to get into the Shop.
2. Line to order.

You're then stood awkwardly hanging around the till to have your name called to check your order is correct before then waiting again to have your name called again.

3. Line to pay.

The items myself and my Sister In Law ordered were extremely underwhelming.

- Caramel Cupcake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#z99RKrkzTHMyAvPytNK2Pg). Cupcake was dry and there was barely any Caramel flavor. The sponge itself was Vanilla with a lightly Caramel flavored whipped Cream Frosting and a blob of Chocolate.

- Caramel Pecan Cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#UMNG2Ovvk7h25q7uIl723w)  Crumbly, Sweet, Buttery. My favorite of the items I got.

- Jelly filled Cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#QRUgV7htWb05IsFC77sHdg). Tasteless, dry.

My Sister In Law didn't like the items she got either - Chocolate Cupcake and Chocolate Brownie. She said that the Cupcake went in the trash after 2 bites and the Brownies I made her just a few days before we ''a million times better''.

Sorry Buddy, just not feeling this.

I met Kelly Garcia Sunday at the Craftsman Court farmer's market in Old Town - She is my cupcake hero. I figured I would wait for some sort of occasion to get myself to another bakery for cupcake testing but Sunday morning the cupcake came to me! I used to make fun of Argentinean hotels that offered breakfast cupcakes and then here I was at 10AM buying a chocolate cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting and tiny lavendar sugar pearls. 

The cupcake: You can tell immediately when someone loves their work, and while I didn't speak to Kelly for any length of time she told me everything I needed to know as soon as I bit into the cupcake. This woman knows cupcakes. My cupcake was light as air - it was that magic blend of moist cake fluffed with air, not to sweet but distinctly chocolate-y, oh it was soooo good. Even the buttercream was light, it was silky too, like maybe it had been made with confectioners sugar because it was so smooth. The frosting was on the high end of the sweet spectrum for me, but the textures mixing around in that cupcake made it spectacular. 

A single cupcake ran me $3 and I didn't ask about pricing on dozens but she did tell me that she offers free delivery in Scottsdale. I just now went to her website where she says she will make you any and every kind of cupcake you could want.  Vanilla cupcake with lemon curd filling and lemon buttercream? yes please. Chocolate with peppermint buttercream? oh mama. I also noticed a sign on her stand that said she could make gluten-free and I bet she could keep me in vegan cupcakes too. oh lord this is very very bad...

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

Having driven by this area weekly, I only noticed Damelos Bakery & Pizzeria; maybe it's their bright signage? On my way home I saw the sign, Sacred Hogan, and immediately flipped a bitch. Frybread and I have a deep connection, it used to be the only reason why I would even go to the State Fair, well that and a foot long corn dog, but that's another story.

I was greeted by a very woofy guy, thick goatee, nice calves and belly... Ah yes, frybread. After looking over the menu I ordered the B.R.G., which is a bean, red chile and green chile Navajo taco ($8.79).

Now I didn't see my taco until I got it home since I got it to go... When I opened the box I swear there was a white light emanating from its center, their tacos are HUGE, ENORMOUS, PORTLY, and well, LARGE! I could sense its mightiness when I was handed the box, but I had no idea until I had it fully exposed. My mouth began to water as I opened to take in the hot and thick goodness, my saliva acting as a lubricant to get the whole thing in. Its girth was only trumped by its heft; it took 2 hands just too barely manage it to my face. At the last second I chickened out, what was I doing? What would the Mr. think of me if he saw me like this, face to face with a potential love affair? Cutting it into more manageable pieces was the right thing to do. The meat in the red and green chile was so tender and well seasoned it just melted with each bite.

At the halfway point I figured I would save half for later since it was so large but I couldn't resist its chewy texture and savory allure. Yes *sniff* *sniff*, I ate the whole thing, every last bite including the tender beans that fell out of the sides!!! With no shame and no guilt, I waddled into the bedroom fell onto the bed and took a 2 hour nap. Sometimes life just doesn't get much better than this. 

I feel like I need a cigarette.

After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. 

I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. 

April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. 

Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.

And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.

Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.

They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.

Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.

Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings.

No f-ing way.  Over an hour's wait and $43 later, only to realize that you're getting this crap from such a highly praised buffet?!?!

I dined at the Wynn buffet when they first opened over 3 years ago and wasn't impressed then, and I am not impressed now.  Let me break it down for you:

* Seafood station: the only worthwhile item of the bunch were the freezing cold crab legs.  You could only find smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail here -- whoopdeedo.  No raw oysters will be found here.

* Sushi: three types of "pseushi"  (Ken K.) consisting of California rolls, vegetarian rolls, and last but not least, Salmon maki rolls.  No sashimi, no nigiri.  They even had this pathetic seaweed salad that was 10% seaweed and 90% celery.  Oh, and not to mention they offered kimchee, because kimchee is so appropriate for sushi.

* Carving station: prime rib, turkey, and rack of lamb.  Everything was fine here, except for the angry carving station lady who couldn't cut the meat properly because she was under-slicing the meat, so she kept losing grip of the knife and thus, splattering beef juice on the customers.  She expressed no apologies for splashing beef juice on the nice blouse of the poor girl in front of me.  Not to mention, when I asked for a more rarer lamb chop (seeing that an entire uncut rack was in front of me), she proceeded to give me a well-done lamb chop that was leftover from everyone else's pickings.  How rude!

* Dessert station: alluring desserts that tasted horrible.  Stay away from the dry cupcakes, rock hard poppy seed lemon pastry, mediocre cookies, and way-too-thick crepes.  The ice cream was delish though.

* Other pathetic and disappointing offerings: hummus, baba ghanoush, pita bread, cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, miso soup, and tons of baked bread as fillers.

The only things keeping the Wynn buffet from plummeting to a 1-star review is their beautiful dining area, amazing vanilla ice cream, tasty lamb chops (when given the perfect medium rare piece), and the attentive service.

Take my advice though, and spend your $50 elsewhere.  Las Vegas has so many other great dining establishments that are well worth the money spent.  The Wynn buffet is just not one of those.

Complimentary cornbread and donuts.

Nuff said. 

OK. There's more! Like the Ronco commercial..."But wait, there's MORE!"

We had trouble finding the front door. Looks it's sweltering hot and our brains were in meltdown. We entered the To Go door which is a very tiny room for take out service only. The lovely employee upon hearing our door troubles said we could come behind the counter and enter the dining room. What? We don't have to go outside again? Love her. She led us right to a perfect table and provided us with menus. Great service! Make it happen!

I was surprised and impressed by the upscale decor. Kind of reminded me of the House of Blues in West Hollywood...made to look like a shack from the outside but quite luxurious inside. Nice. 

Our server Kellee was Killer!!! I wanted to snatch her away. Oops, I said snatch. Anyway, the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese was Bobby Q perfection as was Rickie's brisket sandwich with shoestring fries...the fries...so so yummy! Sweet tea, actually, well, how do you say...should be called super, really, alotta, sweet tea. Sweeter than Paula Deen's pie. Wait. That didn't sound right. 

Bobby Q. I wuv you! 

P.S. Did I detect a little Velveeta in the mac n cheese? Me thinks so and ME LIKEY!

GREEN PACKING

I heard about this place but I had to go check it out myself. It is a short 2 block walk from the Fremont Street experience.  My only advice is to keep your eyes open in the back of your head. It is a short but seedy walk. 

Once you arrive you are greeted by a giant metal bug at the entrance. It is made of recycled stuff. The whole mall is made of those metal shipping containers you see on boats, trains & trucks. I thought that was an incredible way to recycle and go green. It also reminded me of my days of being a child when I stacked blocks. I can not confirm this but the architect might be 5 years old. 

I was really happy to see this place get packed at lunch time which means the tourists are coming down here. There are plenty of outdoor tables and many people were eating at the various restaurants located here. There is a great outdoor stage which has various musical acts. I would check the website for up coming bands. 

There is an old caboose which has been turned into a barber shop. Bring the kids because I am sure they have never seen one of these in real life. So it's like visiting a museum while shopping and eating. 

I highly recommend getting out of the casino area and walking here. You will enjoy relaxing in the sun without the pressures of Vegas beating down on you. Trust me when I say, you will be happy you did.

From the Light Group; creators of some of the most impressive mega clubs, ultra lounges, and restaurants in Vegas, Miami, and Dubai so yes, it's impressive, contemporary, and trendy.  Smoke and mirrors.

Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of "contemporary" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.

To start, the "Hot Rocks" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.

For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  

Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?

Correct sides.  No real standouts.

Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.

Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Smoke and mirrors a bad thing?  Hey, you're in Vegas aren't you?

I felt a little like Honey I Shrunk The Customer sitting in those large chairs at these massive granite and wood tables. Community tables are so risky as most people do not like them. I, on the other hand, enjoy them. We were seated at one end and then joined soon after by a very nice couple. We bantered back and forth a bit and he realized he knew me from my restaurant. Love that!

So, as I said above we were seated. And then waited. And waited. And. Waited. Some. More. Eventually waters were dropped but no beverage order was taken. Again, waiting. Cue the Jeopardy theme music. Finally one of the two servers came by (and in all honesty, they were pretty busy) and dropped off soups, which come with the $6.49 lunch special. Yummy! I ordered tofu fried rice and Rickie had sweet and sour pork. Mine was fantastic, though sadly they neglected to include my spring roll. I would have flagged someone down but I was consumed with worry over my table mate's missing food. They served her friend's food yet hers took at least 10 minutes. Strange. Rickie wasn't pleased with his dish as it was pretty teeny tiny!

Two lunch specials. Two beverages for $18. Not bad. Oh. The decor is so Thai...bright green and gold speckled walls with beautiful Thai rugs. And. Then. For some odd Asian reason...like at China Chili random pieces of scrap paper taped to the walls saying "Dessert. Mango Sticky Rice".

With a little gay spray I could bump this baby up a star!

My friend and I came here during Memorial Day Weekend. We came during the transition between brunch to dinner time (but we paid dinner prices) so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything. 

I remember thinking it was a very decent price for a Vegas Buffet... but then I was not too impressed when it came down to the food. 

I just gathered a bit of everything to take *a bite* and the only thing that I really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese, shrimp cocktail & crab legs!! After the experimental plates, I just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my money's worth!! 

I also wanted to try the prime rib, but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a medium/medium-rare cut. I saw all of the meats and it DID look too over cooked so I passed on the prime rib. What a disappointment... 

I was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection... I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate: macaroons, eclairs, tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry... but it was all so mediocre... Most items only got one bite from me. I took a double taste on the flan, but I was still not impressed. The only dessert I finished was this Cappuccino shooter (minus the whipped cream on top).

With successful locations in NYC and Williamsburg, I expected the best pizza on this side of the Mississippi, but unfortunately I was dealt arguably the worst meal I've had in LV in the past 4.5 months. From the minute my takeout order was brought from the kitchen, I knew I was in for trouble. Here's a rundown of the eats...

Chicken Tikka Masala Pasta- $16 - Take away the creamy goodness of a masala sauce, take away any resemblance of chicken and imagine yourself eating dry, leftover spaghetti from a few days before. Voil! You have made this dish in your mind. Tamest masala this side of Bombay. Nothing against the pasta itself, I'm not hating on the lack of gluten, I'm hating on the lack of chicken, sauce and flavor. 

Chana Masala Personal Pizza- $13 - Take a generic flatbread you can buy in Walgreens, add a box of frozen chana masala from TJ's (minus most of the flavor), a bit of tomato sauce and some mozz cheese, then cook in a toaster, but take it out a few minutes before it's ready. Voil! You have again made a dish in your mind! Seriously, isn't this 'dough' the 'homemade specialty' of the house? When pizza is thin, isn't it supposed to be crunchy? Why does it taste like someone made this in Home Ec class... and got a C-? 

And yes, I ordered two Indian style dishes from an American/pizza place. But it's not a large menu. It's not like I was expecting fresh sushi from a diner. For the area, you can do way better with your money. 

While waiting for the food, I overheard some people wondering why the place is empty most of the time. 'It's this side of the street!' they said. No, friends. It's all of the above. 

Why 2-stars instead of 1? The place looks pretty slick. Would def have a brew at the bar.

For an inaugural festival, Life is Beautiful outdid themselves. They really transformed downtown Las Vegas into something spectacular filled with food, music, art, and learning. For a first year event it was really well-organized.

The VIP experience was worth it as the Zappos sponsored Recharge Retreat including all complimentary cocktails, massages, braid bar, candy bar, and more. The retreat stayed open throughout which was great for getting drinks and VOSS bottled water on a hot day.

You don't get the high quality of food at music festivals like the kinds we saw at LIB. Most dishes at the Culinary VIllage were $10/plate and were from some of the biggest names such as Nobu Las Vegas and Tom Colicchio's 'wichcraft.

The layout was massive with multiple stages and a scale that I heard was even greater than Coachella but with a less crowds. It made for a lot of walking but there was so much to see that even going from 12pm to 11:30pm, we still weren't able to see everything the festival had to offer.

Imagine Dragons put on a great homecoming performance of "Radioactive" with Cirque du Soleil cast members performing alongside the Las Vegas based band in what they exclaimed was the true Vegas style of "doing it big."

Dawes put on one of the better performances of the day and they are definitely a band to keep your eye out for. They sounded amazing!

My only complaint was the taxi line at the end of the night which could have been handled much more smoothly if they had more staff. The local police officers did the best they could with the masses but there just weren't enough taxis.

But, since the whole thing was an almost flawless experience, I left repeating what many of the artists echoed throughout the night: "life is beautiful!"

This place ruined my weekend. I came to Vegas to get married and was told by a friend how incredible this place is expected to be. So I looked it up and on their website, this place looks phenomenal! 

I'm a firm believer in getting one chance to make a first impression and as soon as I park my car and unload, I realize the parking lot elevators are broken. As if carrying luggage down 4 flights isn't bad enough, we get to the check in counter and it literally took each front desk person an average of 20 minutes to check in each guest, us included. Finally, we get to the room and I will say the ambiance is nice, but the room sizes are tiny. Turning on the tv and it says it has a "server error" aka it doesn't work. I plan to ask the GM if we can cancel one of our nights so that we can relocate to the Venetian. 

I probably should have done my due diligence and checked the yelp reviews before booking, but I guess I didn't expect many flaws from a brand new hotel.

"I will remember these shrimp for the rest of my life."  This is what my mom said after tasting the bacon-wrapped shrimp at Wildfish.

I knew I had to come back for a full meal after swooning over the amazing appetizers at the Yelp Elite event.  So, when my mom came out to visit I had the perfect opportunity to prove that great seafood can be found in the desert.  Wildfish did not disappoint.

After consulting with our (super awesome) waiter Christian, we started off with two appetizers - the crabcake and the bacon-wrapped shrimp with goat cheese.  Both were just as fantastic as I remembered.  The crabcake is large and perfect for sharing and is served with a light remoulade sauce.  The shrimp come three to a plate, complimented with a small stack of light onion rings.  My mom really knows that I love her, as I declined her (feeble and halfhearted) offers to split the third shrimp with me!

The parade of deliciousness continued with the entrees - Roasted Sea Bass and Snapper Filet with Johah Crab.  Both were served with delicate sauces that enhanced, not overpowered, the flavor of the fish.  We shared a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  All sides are served family-style and the portions are large but can be ordered in half sizes that are perfect for two.

5 star staff, 5 star food.  Overall it was a great experience in every way.

First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.  So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one. 

So we went to zinburger.  I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry. 

Sooo.  We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.  The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.  Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.  It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.  The flavor was sublime. 

We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.  It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.  For $3!!

My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.  Well she actually said she liked it.  It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite. 

Really though, the food was phenomenal.

I love Spearmint Rhino but the negative is that it ruined all other strip clubs for me.  How could you beat free limo ride, no cover and gorgeous girls?

We called the number on their website and they brought a stretch limo to take just four people.  Our chauffeur Tony was very polite and friendly.  When we got in, it was very crowded but we lucked out and found a table.  We eventually were able to make our way to seats on the main stage.  Drinks are a little more expensive but very tall so well worth the money.

Now lets talk about the most important part.  I saw about 100+ girls and none of them were under an 8.  A great variety of pretty girls and some of them with fantastic talent on the poles.  My bf and I had an amazing time and this place is a definite must for my next visit to Vegas!

In terms of hibachi restaurant experiences, Kanji is on the top of my list. The large open space has 4 hibachi grills with open seating around them. Yes, you might sit next to a stranger (gasp!), but isn't that half the fun? The staff was excellent and made our evening a joy. Dropping the sake into our sake bombs, being quick with a refill and even taking some flavored sake shots with us. Speaking of, you should def imbibe in a few of those shots. They are delicious and relatively low in potency. 

The food was excellent as well. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and stayed tender (I always find that food cooked on a hibachi grill it hardens up rather quickly), scallops were large, beef tataki was tatasty and the fried rice and accompanying sauces were great accompaniments to the meat. I've had quite a few hibachi chef's who come in, do their routine and then walk off like nothing happened. That wasn't the case here. Our dude, was crackin' jokes, talking to us, making some new rice art (Sponge Bob!) and an all around good dude. 
 
Grab a group of friends and head on over here! (Just make sure you go low sodium for a few days after). 

Protip: free sake bomb with Yelp check-in!

I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.

The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you. 

Oh the bartenders are awesome make great fun shots

This review is for the casino and restaurant areas only.

I came here to meet two friends at the Griddle Cafe the morning they were open.  After breakfast, I took the time to roam the property and see the restaurant selection and make note of places I want to come back and try.  

The casino area was not very crowded until I was leaving because i had arrived so early.  The line for The Code--their slot club--was very long wqhen I left.  The casino is rather small compared to what it was when the hotel was the Sahara.   The emphasis here is less on gaming and more on food and entertainment.

The place has been nicely redone.  The porte-cochre is completely different and has a sculpture called SAM, for Philippe Starck's idea of Sam Nazarian.  It, along with much of the interior was designed by Starck.  He's not a fan of traditional Las Vegas slot machine toppers so he designed the faces that have tongues.  He also used Nazarian's girlfriend as a model for the entrance to Cleo.

This is a place worth coming back to for restaurant trying.  I'm not sure the LiFE Club would be something appealing to me and it wouldn't be my first choice for gaming.  But the restaurant lineup looks enticing on its own.

I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior. 

I highly recommend their Eggs Benedict ($13). My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict. 

I also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto ($13) served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again.

The Farmer's Market Frittata ($10) was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home.

The dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll ($5) and the Iron Skillet Pancake ($8). The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread-like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again. 

The Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor.

My dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you. 

With all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.

5 STARS because I was really impressed with with the manager.. I guess an employee failed to come in during the busy "Grand Opening". She came to every single table to notify them and also checked up on how everyone and their meals were doing, without being overly bothersome, lol.
Of course our server was attentive and friendly as well!

5 STARS to the food! 
Items ordered :
- White Sangria : if you like strong sangria this is the drink for you. They got me at "papaya" but wasn't a fan, imagined it to be more on the sweet side.
- Mandarin Orange Tangerine Mimosa : Absolute FAVE! Glad my friend got it! Sounded too orangey but it's the perfect blend! High class orange juice, with alcohol, with a little bit of pulp! 
- Almond Brioche French Toast with Almond Butter & Coconut Syrup (made in house) : DELICIOUS! Three thick pieces, moist and very flavorful! Dusted with powdered sugar, topped with coconut almond custard, and comes with raspberry & mixed tropical fruits.. The Almond Butter and Coconut Syrup were just extra icing on the French toast! 
- Belgian Waffles : nothing to special with these waffles, topped with fruit and chose almond butter with maple syrup with it, nonetheless still a good waffle!
- 36hr Braised Short Rib Loco Moco topped with Lentil Gravy, comes with Eggs to your liking, Fried Rice, & Crispy Onion Rings : NO KNIFE NEEDED! Extremely tender, seasoned well, great textures with the crispy fried onion, fried egg and fried rice (I think I said "fried" too much lol), and overall a great loco moco! 

4 STARS to the long drive out there and the water cup with no ice \_()_/..

Still a great experience! Must try other great menu items!

NO RETREAT!
NO SURRENDER!

Ohhh wait yes surrender to me please, insert evil laugh;  MUHAHAHAHA!

So yes I had some fun times here with a bunch of friends. I think that perhaps the biggest reason was that we prepartied like a bunch of drunks. We showed up at this place 5 sheets to the wind, not your typical 3! In other words, we were thankful for cab rides and cheap drinks. 

We were scattered across several guess lists but were all able to cruise in together once we arrived. I was on the Crowd Control LV guess list and was in for free. Thanks Chhen! 

Pro Tip: Do not plan on clubben in tennis shoes, hats, or douchey v-neck tee shirts.

When we showed up women were drinking for free and the guys had to pay $19-$23 per drink! That was ridiculous, but that is how LV clubs are unfortunately. They also had more tables than any club I have ever been to. 

Pro Tip #2: You can rest/sit down on the edge of the planters throughout the club. 

The main dance floor has a bar along one side as well as the entrance, a couple of stripper poles (only the staff gogogirls can use them though =\), a number of tables and the DJ booth. The best part was that they had some water cooling misters or something like that to help it stay a tad bit cooler in the 100+ degree heat.

Pro Tip #3: Beginning around 1am a number of the tables started to clear so we were able to snag one for our group

The music was good, lots of fun dancing as well. A place I would go back to so long as I prepartied and was on the right guest list for free! Fun stuff in the long run. Perhaps I will see you there...

Spread, spread, spread is what makes the newly renovated buffet at Caesar's phenomenal. The new layout and revamp of menu will give the Bellagio and Wynn a run for their money. 

Coming in for breakfast, I was impressed. It left me wondering what dinner was bound to feature. Near the entrance, in the morning, the cold bar is stocked with fresh juices. The beautiful display of colors draws the eyes in and my hand started grabbing. Orange, grapefruit, watermelon, and carrot were available for the taking. Fresh fruit and parfaits contain tropical fruits such as starfruit sit above.

The next line had many forms of bacon including turkey and three different kinds of pork. Eggs benedict come in a traditional form, but the one using the potato cake was way better. The chiliquiles were soggy since they were constructed ahead of time. The small portions in skillets give the perfect serving of most dishes. The little frying basket of maple tots were drool inducing. Plated servings of regular and red velvet pancakes are placed out as guest take them. Beautiful, the red velvet flavor was not present. Although this concept of single serving goodness is not new, Bacchanal does it much better. 

Moving on, there was an egg station which would prepare your eggs any way you wish or just pick from the rolls, pizzas, and quiche on display. A whole line was dedicated to bagels, lox, and spread. Some are made in advance, but you could easily make your own. 

Continue on for the thinly sliced prosciutto and other meats, then comes the cheese selection. At the very end there is an Asian section which includes the dim sum. I was not impressed with this offering. My friend and I paced ourselves because desserts are essential no matter what time it is.

Between two of us; we got a blackberry cobbler, four kinds of ice cream, a berries and nutella crepe, and waffles. I used the infused honey near the bread station instead of maple syrup for my waffle and it was magic. 

For $16.99, you will not find a better deal for breakfast.

Any visit to Las Vegas would not be complete without a trip to Honolulu Cookie Company especially if you're a bit of a Cookie Monster.

Located inside the Venetian it may take some time to find but once it is a plethora of delicious little Cookies await in flavors like Pineapple Macadamia, White Chocolate Coconut, Lilikoi Mango and Chocolate Chip Macadamia. Now that Fall is upon us some new flavors have made it's way into store's - Ginger Spice and White Chocolate Ginger Spice. 
The store is small and well laid out with lot's of assorted boxes or you can create your own box, 5 Cookies for $4.95 or 10 for $8.95. They also had some large containers that hold maybe 20-25 but I did not see any pricing for those.
The staff are very welcoming and encouraged us to sample as many of the flavors as wanted until we had come to a decision which ones to get, the sample station is located near the door with jar's of little Cookie pieces you can help yourself to.

As for the Cookies themselves.. Yum! I'm a it of a snob when it comes to Shortbread being that I am British with a Northern background (where Shortbread originated) so trust me when I say these are really good! They're baked and imported from Honolulu which explains the slightly hefty price tag but they are worth it.

*TIP*
 Get a "Aloha Card" and receive a stamp for every $5 spent, 20 stamps gets you free Cookies! Also sign up for the ''Pineapple ERewards'' where you will get special offers throughout the year including one for your Birthday.

Not. 
A.
Fan.

Don't believe me? Ask Steven or Liz (not Steve L or Liz B, but Steven V and Liz H) they've had the unfortunate task of witnessing me throwing a temper tantrum on more than one occasion at the door. (But they like, and I like them, and so I go.)

Why? BECAUSE THEY CHARGE A COVER! Even if it's 1:30 and they stop serving at 2am. (I almost left this weekend). 

Why does this irk me? 

Because when I pay for something, in this case, to walk inside the door, with that exchange of my hard earned cash comes the expectation I'm going to get something in return. And what do I get for my $5? 

1. A bathroom situation that's an unfortunate cross between a slip-n-slide and a bad Friends re-run all about Joey... "how you doin?" Seriously, can someone mop that floor? It's not safe and it's just plain gross. Couple that with the lurkers that think it's ok to watch me urinate, keep staring and I'm going to stare back, and you know what's going to happen? (Figure it out, when I turn, my whole body comes with me.)

2. Bartenders working for tips find it more important to werk than work. I just want a drink, and I'm already pissed that I paid five bucks for nothing, so get his/her number later and get me alcohol. 

3. Cups on the ground. (Why are their plastic cups on the ground? Always? This isn't Woodstock/SXSW/or anything as cool.) 

I'll stop there. 

I did ask once why there's a cover and I was told, "it keeps the riff-raff out." Not true. I've been, I've seen, the riff-raff find their way in. 

You know who doesn't charge a cover and isn't concerned with riff-raff? Every other bar in Madison.

$5 to get in +
$3 to check my coat = 
$8 to wish I was somewhere else.

XS is nothing short of stunning. This nightclub is aptly named as everything is seriously in excess.

Check out this beautiful picture of the pool. Wow!
http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9wi2sjt7DqxocVEleO-_MQ/l

AMBIANCE - 5
When I first walked in I literally stopped to take everything in and could not close my jaw. The dance floor, bars, and outside area are illuminated by a variety of soft neon and natural lights, there are huge statues everywhere, and there is a huge pool in the center that captures everyone's attention. (especially those who are drunk enough to jump in and get kicked out.) They also have beautiful ladies doing things on stages and poles around the dance floor and near the pool which is erm... always fun. 

COVER -4
Men are usually $30 and women are $20, which is decent for an upscale Vegas club. If you buy tickets from random vendors on the strip, you can get in for about $2-3 bucks a person! My friends and I did this, so we had some "extra money" left over for drinks.

THE BARS - 4
http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RDU9ch-Duz-P05Ik16r_kw/l
Picture of one of the bars ^^^

The bartenders are almost as polite as they are efficient, occasionally smiling during their blitz of drink making. Drinks are expensive but hey, it's Vegas. AMF's are $16 bucks each with shots running a little cheaper. Don't get carried away in all of your fun, it really adds up. (That is why flasks and pre-gaming  were invented!)

THE DANCEFLOOR - 3.5
http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RHyfezuyZdQz5_5xDZo1Cw/l
Picture of the dance floor ^^^

The music was a little off, probably to cater to the diverse crowd. No matter what you like or dislike, you will be unhappy for some time during the night, as the music is played in strange "blocks." They mashed up some weird techno beats for 30 minutes, which we hated, and then transitioned into Nirvana before finally getting into some hip hop club songs for another 30 minutes. The floor itself is CROWDED to the max with energetic patrons mostly in their 20's and early 30's flailing around with the help of some good drinks. Even when the songs are bad, the floor is never clear. Choose a spot and commit, and be sure to have a meeting point, as this club is huuuge and texting on the floor to find your chums is not very effective. 

Overall, I had a great time and ended up going twice. My friends and I will probably go back if we ever return to the City of Sin!

Ohhhh myyyy goshhhh I LOVED this place! =)

So my friend wanted to go to dinner one lovely evening. I found this place on Yelp and it sounded really good. For the entree I ordered the Baked Artisan Goat Cheese Crepes. This thing was freaking amazinggggg... So good! It came with spinach, herb grilled wild mushrooms, roasted bell pepper sauce, and watercress salad. The special sauce that was on it was really good as well. For drinks, you HAVE to get the Bunny Slope. I saw a picture of it on Yelp and just had to try it. It comes with Vodka, Strawberry Cream Infusion, White Chocolate Liqueur. You wouldn't think it was that strong since it's on the thicker side but it was! So dam yummy! 

Not only was the food amazing but the service was spectacular. This place has only been open for a little over a year but I really enjoyed it. My only recommendation is maybe they need a little more decor in the place. The walls felt a little bit of plain jane. I will DEFINITELY be coming back for dinner, AND they have a happy hour that they will most likely see me at in the near future. =)

Dear Michael Boychuck,

your salon is beautiful and i am sure you are a fabulous stylist. the customer service is great, and all, but you have this one stylist who is truly an ass. i think his name is juan and i was given to him by the front receptionist to trim my hair which was a Victoria beckham bob. hes a freakin ass. he gave me a bowl cut and didnt listen to me at all. he was a stylist with an ego... and i left unhappy, paid like 150 for a freakin trim from hell. DO NOT EVER LET JUAN CUT UR HAIR. i blame the front desk to for giving me to him. i was so unhappy, i came back the same day and asked for extensions in the near my face because the asshole cut my whole head to one legnth. everyone knows victoria beckhams hair is long in the front and short in the back...but its a bob!!!

just so you kno, JUAN IS A HAIR EXTENSION SPECIALIST. i think that asshole cut my hair off so i would get a full head of extensions. well i got a little in the front and made him cut me a bob, which he still couldnt do!!! They charged me like 110 for a pack of extensions and made Juan put them in for free and re cut my hair... I STILL FREAKIN HAD TO PAY. JUST FOR THE COST OF THE HAIR BUT WTF? asshole still couldnt cut my hair right... i ended up going home and trimming it down myself. he even told me "personally i think it looked great the 1st time" I Told him, you dont have to live with it, and it is not what i wanted. worst experience ever.

i love the decor, but please fire that guy! he's an ass and thinks he know everything. #1 listen to your customer. 

BOWL CUT DOES NOT EQUAL BOB! F you JUAN! I HATE U!

Let me tell you...I'm very (VERY!) picky about my car, who works on it, and how it looks at all times. I was raised to believe that your vehicle (and it's cleanliness) is a sign of your personality and outward expression of your life in general.  Mine, it must be perfect, end of story.

I had my Audi in the shop to repair my front bumper, fender, headlight and foglight after an accident.  I just got my car back and it is perfect; that's the only way to describe it.  The paint matches perfectly.  The parts fit back perfectly.  The factory tolerances in the seams are perfect; yes I checked.  The car was returned clean inside and out.  The job was completed exactly when they said it would be; no BS excuses or monkeying around.  Car. Fixed. Perfect. On. Time.

These guys are pros, plain and simple.  One thing I require, and they deliver, is frequent updates on the status of my vehicle...I won't sleep well otherwise.  Every other day I received an email from Don giving me the scoop and where they were at in the process.  Love it!

I don't know how these guys compare on price to other shops in town and I really don't care.  This place provides high quality labor and it's worth the cost.  Check out the back of the shop...I challenge you to find a cleaner environment.  This is my, and should be your, go-to body shop.

I like to Rant.  I like to Rave.  I also like to revisit places that I deem "5 star worthy" to make SURE I hadn't made a mistake.  Occasionally, I'll revisit a failure JUST to see if they've cleaned up their act.  Well, with such an AWESOME first review I did on this place, I was BOUND to write a sequel. THIS, my friend, is just that.

Before I even came in here, I was DEAD set on ordering the luscious fish and chips. Now, I've spent a few nights in England (1,460 to be exact), so I feel like I know authentic Fish n chips when I taste them. Alas, my wandering eyes made me forget all about them when I saw "Shepherd's Pie"... I've had some PRETTY bad Shepherd's Pies in my day so I figured "Lets give them a chance to measure up"

Now, there is comfort food that will help you relax and take you deep away from everything stressful in your present day. Then, there is comfort food that will prop up your feet and suck on your toes while performing a deep massage just below your scapula. Rosie's Shepherd's Pie... was the latter.

I can't place the spices they used in the ground beef stew, but it was genius.  Also, the consistency was MUCH better than traditional Shepherd's Pie.  It was more of a rouge like Chili (without the chili spicing)... It had carrots that were slightly sweet and peas that popped in your mouth releasing glorious green goo to mix with the hot beef and such on its way down to your belly. "Don't stop rubbing... keep working those toes..."

Now we get to the potatoes on top.  They weren't overly ambitious.  By this, I mean they weren't ruined with too much garlic/butter/cream/etc... They had a GREAT natural potato taste with crispy, broiled cheese on top forming a wonderful pie crust-like seal of protection.  Except this seal was a guarantee... Guaranteeing you will stalk this dish in your dreams for the rest of your life.

Yes, I revisited the water closet. Cleaner...
The service was JUST as good as before if not better! Attentive, slightly humorous, and great attitude.

I have come to decide that you can't go wrong at Rosie's... Plus free metaphorical food sex! Bonus!

Came in last night for my gfs 21st birthday. We had dinner at yard house and the plan was to have drinks and dessert here after.... We should have just stayed at YH. 

My Gf had a reservation all set up, they even called to confirm with her a few days ago. When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server "they didn't even have a reservation" it's not like we needed one, there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied, and for good reason...

I've dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location. The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card. Our table was being completely ignored. I've been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for. I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there's but nothing. It never happened. It really put a damper on the night. 
There are so many places in Vegas especially to celebrate your 21st and we chose here... But we will never make that mistake again. I would be much happier paying full price for the other location or somewhere else entirely.

I love Mom and Pop run businesses. 

I was driving along Chandler Boulevard, saw the sign "Family Run Business" and decided to stop.  

There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter. 

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in. 

But if you are tired of the "same old, same old" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change. 

Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeo corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99. 

I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ "A-Okay" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL

I went here with a group of six and everyone was pretty bombed after a fun afternoon on the strip.  Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy "Macho Man" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.  

My jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!

The spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.     

Then all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were "tender as fuck".  I agreed.  

The main event was the "Four Pasta Special" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.

My wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.  If a full on Italian pig out is what you're looking for, look no further.

The Chelsea Ballroom is located on the fourth floor of the Cosmopolitan. I came here to see a little band know as the Black Keys!!! The venue however is excellent even for a makeshift music venue. The acoustics weren't too bad, and for GA, you can get pretty up close and personal to the stage. There were seats as well, but really for a band like Black Keys, you want to do GA and rock out! Not stuck in a chair!! 

The bar scene: one large bar in the very back, two smaller bars on the side. Drinks are normal Vegas price. $7 for guinness.  $7 for fat tire. $7 for Sierra Nevada. $12 for a shot jger. Some of the bars take cash only and some take credit cards as well, so make sure you are in the right line!

The band:  Big Boi opened up for Black Keys and Black Keys were amazing!!! Such a great live band, I would definitely put them up as my top 5 favorite band to watch live. The drummer played his cymbals with a tambourine and the guitarist played his guitar with maracas!! Amazing!! If you ever get a chance to see them, please do, you won't regret it!

Oh and almost forgot to mention...tickets are purchased thru the cosmopolitan website which means no ticketmaster which means NO FEES!!! So to see the Black Keys just cost me $35 plus $0 fees!! 5 stars just for that!

My fiancee Santi and I came across this tapas-style restaurant on Yelp and decided to swing by for an early dinner. Dcor-wise, the restaurant had a nondescript exterior, sidewalk seating, communal tables, and all-around wooden interior. We were the first to arrive, but eventually the room was filled with small groups, families, and young professionals at every turn.

The Rabbit Rillette ($10) came with a large jar of chilled rabbit and handfuls of crushed pistachio embedded. There was also a side of sweet cherries marinated in thick syrup, and the crisp toasted bread had a nice texture and crunch. Once these ingredients were stacked together, the rabbit was absolutely sensational. There was plenty of meat in the jar to mix easily with a top layer of rabbit fat. The cherry also added an unusual sweet-tart dimension of refinement, and the server was generous to provide additional servings of the toasted bread. I thought the bread could use a smoky flavor to extend the overall experience, but otherwise it was a nice opener that is easy to share. I highly recommend it.

The Lamb Carpaccio ($14) came with thinly sliced raw lamb, corn shoots, raw egg yolk, and salsa verde. The innovative combination had a unique flavor, but our taste buds were able to come to some coherence by the second serving. For the price, the plate could have included more lamb. I also thought the dish needed an additional egg or alternatives such as quail or duck eggs to make the innovation much more compelling. There were also no kicks in the salsa verde, which was another idea that the chef should consider playing with. Otherwise, I enjoy the lifts in the flavors generated by the corn shoots. I really liked this dish, but thought the innovation could take a few more turns and twists. 

The Octopus ($13) was served with two long tentacles stacked on top of a good number of mussels, green garlic, crazy water, and spinach. The octopus was very tender, but a hint of charred smoke would have sent it out of this world. The mussels were excellent with good size, fresh, and very moist. I also enjoyed the spinach, and thought the complex seafood flavors mingled nicely with the use of seawater. Having more seawater to serve as a dip would be a nice idea to consider for the future.

Lastly, the Veal Neck ($21) arrived with miso, carrots, turnips, ramps, and radishes. The carrot was nicely pureed into a sauce that went nicely with the charred turnip. Although the veal was tender and easy to fork off the bone, it also needed more seasoning. Very simply, the taste of miso was absent to help the veal to make a stronger statement. We didn't enjoy this particular dish and weren't able to finish it.

Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. He knew the menu inside out, and was prompt to provide new plate settings while he orchestrated the meal. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Porchetta, Pork Tripe, Pork Belly, and Foie Gras Mousse.

I really wanted to like this place. I really did. 

I ordered the two meat combo. It is your choice of two meats and two sides. Comes with Texas toast. I chose pulled pork and ribs for the meat. Cincinnati Fries and Sweet Potato Casserole for the sides. 

The ribs had a dry rub on there that was decent. The pulled pork was tender but had no flavor. I poured the default barbeque sauce that was on the table. The sauce itself was a little bland but at least when you put it on the pulled pork it gave it some life.

The Cincinnati Fries were basically Chili Cheese Fries. The Chili itself is not what im used to. It was a bit runny and not spicy at all. The Sweet Potato Casserole was decent. It was pretty sweet and was topped with pecans.

The total I paid was 24.17 and that's with tax and 20 percent tip. Now as you can see that is bit pricey for the meal I had. Imagine if I got a fountain drink. That would have bumped it to 27 bucks. Their menu is the same no matter lunch or dinner. It would be awesome if they had lunch specials. 

Their location is a bit of find because they share the same building as Doc Holidays. I gotta admit, it is pretty spacious and clean. The service was decent.

Some random info: They play Blues music here. Nothing against it but the whole time I was there, the 6 or 7 songs I heard were all about growing up in the South and people finding the love of their life then breaking up which inspired the song they are singing. The songs I heard were different variations of the same thing. On February 2 they are gonna start a Karaoke thing. I guess that would be better than listening to depressing songs about your spouse and your dog running away. I guess people singing out of tune is more entertaining.

So overall, I wasnt too impressed. I don't usually wanna spend 20 plus dollars for lunch. I hate to say it but having eaten here is definitely gonna make me do that Dickey's Barbeque review. I think their barbeque sauce is what makes their beef brisket and pulled pork even better. AND you dont spend more than 20 bucks for one person.

Sure we're in the desert, but guess what? That doesn't mean we don't have some beautiful lakes to keep us cool! Believe it or not, before this past weekend, I had never been to Lake Pleasant. What was I thinking!? I've clearly been on crazy pills, dealing with triple digit summers without visiting this lake to cool me down. Now that I know better, I am a new, improved and much more cooled down woman! 

Lake Pleasant is in the Northwest Valley, about 15 minutes west of the 1-17 and Carefree highway. Driving there, you'd never ever think a large body of water exists, but it does! Once you make the turnoff, you all of a sudden see a canyon with a huge body of water. It's a desert lake and surrounded by majestic mountains and canyons. It's beautiful to sit in the middle of the lake and simply take in the desert setting. 

We rented a pontoon boat from Scorpion Bay and boated around the lake the entire day. The lake itself is huge, clean and nice and cold! The water is pretty clear and I didn't see a critter once in the water all day. We did however see some interesting wildlife on the shore, including a pack of wild burros and bald eagles who nest here. We would also spot some lake fish here and there. 

Lake Pleasant is a perfect spot for boating, water sports such as paddle boarding and paddle boats, house boating and fishing. If you need to take a break from the lake, you can stop by Dillions and have some food while listening to live music. 

Some notes...where a LOT of sunscreen, especially in the summer heat. You'll find yourself spending most of the day in the water which means your sunscreen will wash off so you have to remind yourself to re-apply. 

Bring several floating devices to float in the lake with. If you forget, the life vests to sit on serve as a great improvise. 

I suggest renting a pontoon (the rental process was seamless), boating to one of the beautiful canyoned off corners, anchoring your boat and floating the day away. It's incredibly relaxing and a great way to cool down in triple digits.

I'm going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.

+ Luke Warm Broth: "Ohhhh hell naw!"
+ Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: "You're kidding, right?!"
+ Stale Rice Noodles: "Can my lunch get any worse?"
+ Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: "Definitely ohh hell naw!!!"
+ Wait time for the Pho: "Beyond ridiculous."

Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I'm sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There's no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I've had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.

The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.

Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.

Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho? 

Enough said.

About a week ago, our AC finally gave out and died.

We have been trying to keep it alive for the last five years.  Freon, new blower, condenser, still more freon, welding a leak, a new outside fan and heater switch, and finally still more freon.  

So I found myself around midnight searching Yelp for HVAC businesses and couldn't find any in my area.  I then tried "Air Conditioning", nothing.  Finally I expanded the area and found Flores, 

Parker and Sons, George Brazil were also listed.  But after reading a few reviews, I decided to go with Flores.  They had over 55 reviews, by far and away the most of any HVAC business. Of those 55 reviews, an incredible 49 were Five Stars. I also saw and read many of my Yelp friends, and decided to give them a call the next morning.

I knew before they came, that our time was up with the old unit. Though I held out some hope that maybe there was a possible stop gap measure. But it was pretty clear what was needed to be done.  

I spoke to Miguel and Jorge for a long time and we agreed they would work up an estimate. No charge for their hour long visit and stating the obvious. Very professional. 

The next day I received by email an indepth estimate for the new unit and air handler. We had a very old four ton Trane unit which was too small for our house. 

The new Trane unit was going to be five tons (see photos). After reviewing their estimate, I stopped by Costco and other places, as well as searching online. Everywhere, the estimates were at least $2,000 or more higher than the Flores' estimate

I gave them the go ahead and it took a little more than a week. They arrived early yesterday morning and put drop cloths down throughout the house. I was very impressed. 

Flores is actually four brothers, who work very well together. They all have their own specialty. Seems they've done this before. LOL

They arrived at 7:30 am and finished around 5pm. When they were finished, the house was at 89 degrees. It took less than twenty-five minutes for our new AC to get it down 73!

The final bill came in exactly at the original estimate. Wow!  Thank you Miguel, Jorge, Carlos and Jaime!  If I could give you guys Six Stars I would.

Where do I begin... well, let me start by saying you don't matter to Mandalay Bay unless you're a 'whale' (their term for big time gamblers).  If you're here with your family for a vacation and just looking to have fun -- sorry, even if you can afford it, you're not getting a cabana.  You're lucky to even get a chair.  They will -- as they've personally told me -- physically remove you from a cabana if one of their 'whales' so happens to desire the cabana you're in.  It's their policy.  They might make up for it by giving you a lawn chair out in the 110 degree heat with no sun protection... you know, where you belong!  Equivalent to 'let them eat cake' in my opinion. 

Furthermore, let's say you're like me and you do happen to gamble a lot.  Maybe you've even made their second highest status (Platinum) like me... yeah, that doesn't matter either.   In fact, on two separate occasions now it has yet to matter.  They say Platinum members are given "priority cabana reservations" ...  What they mean to say is, "you can call us at a special VIP number only to have someone say 'sorry, get lost' in a little nicer tone".  It's a complete joke.  They only care about you if you are losing the kind of money that could run most cities for weeks.  

If you are spending money on dinners and shows and suites and whatnot... get lost, they don't want your business.  If you have a chronic gambling problem and don't mind paying the electric bill for Vegas while you're there... Welcome to Mandalay Bay -- let me kick this family out of a cabana that they should never have been allowed in in the first place!

Just as an aside -- I've only had this experience at MGM properties.  The Wynn, The Cosmopolitan & The Palms actually apologized to me for the treatment I received from MGM properties.  I can tell you honestly they don't treat their guests this way.  Nobody should!

In a city full of displaced Chicagoans longing for their beef, dogs, and deep dish it would seem odd to some that one of the most exciting Windy City imports to Sin City in years has arrived in the form of Japanese Street food but having been lucky enough to attend the soft opening this Saturday suffice it to say that Yusho is poised to buck the trend of "celebrity chef" Strip-side dining.  Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.

This was my second visit to the museum in Las Vegas.  I first got hooked on the works of Madame Tussaud when a friend brought me to the museum in Manhattan.  Initially, it was kind of weird standing next to all the life-size replicas of famous celebrities, sports figures and politicians, but when I finally started noticing the detail that goes into every figure I found the figures much more interesting to admire.

It's a fun place to visit and photography is highly encouraged.  For non-camera carrying visitors they have stations set up where their in-house photographers can take a photo of you with adult star Jenna Jameson, a pajama-clad Hugh Hefner or a robust Elvis Presley figure.  For those with cameras you can put on a hat (provided) and pose with the Rat Pack, put on some showgirl's headpiece (also provided) and pose with the Mayor of Las Vegas or grab a paddle (yes, provided) and play alongside the Blue Man Group.  The staff tells visitors it's okay to touch the figures too.  I put my hand up to Britney Spears' face, and yes it was as cold and lifeless as I had imagined.  The hard casted wax feels very much like plastic.

This visit found many more figures I had not seen before as well as upgrades of some of the figures I had seen four years ago.  Jennifer Lopez seems to have gotten new hair and the new Madonna figure is a bit more meaty than her previous figures.  I liked the new figures of Beyonce Knowles, Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp and Spider-Man!  Sadly, the figure of President Barack Obama was removed from the floor for maintenance.

There is an optional exhibit inside called Scream with horror figures popping out designed for a sudden scare in a dark setting.  After the first one popped up the rest just seemed kind of quirky.  One lady walking ahead of me kept screaming ... loud.  I just wanted to punch her out.  Glad this little excursion is optional because I found it to be a one time only thing.  The novelty of fright wears off very quickly, and no, I did not punch out the lady.

The museum is located to the side of the Venetian Hotel and Casino.  The best time to visit is when you've had too much to eat, seen too many gaming areas or are just tired of looking at merchandise you can't afford.  Madame Tussaud's is a great place to spend two hours.  As with most museums you exit into the gift shop which I found to be the most boring part of this exhibit.

It was a little quiet at work so I decided it was a good day to have an offsite lunch. I yelped new spots in Chinatown.

Yes, this is the old Anime place, and the maid place which I did not get to try. It is next door to Kaya Sushi. 

We ordered the Roti to start and it was one of the best in Las Vegas, next to Island Malaysian and Veggie House. It was freshly sauteed and fluffy. The sauce was slightly spicy but nothing too fancy (because the Roti was the star). 

I read the restaurant was opened by Thai people so I was hesitant about ordering anything not Thai or Southeast Asian, but my Ramen craving was still going strong, so I had to try their Tonkatsu Ramen. The ramen was the thin noodle kind, with a really tasty, savory and sticky broth. The pork was tender, sliced really thin, and was surprisingly good. The major difference was that there were fried shallots added, and that totally changed the flavor profile, in a good way.   

I was also able to try a slice of the roasted pork from another noodle soup dish, and again, it was surprisingly good, sliced thin and flavorful. 

Side note, their entire menu is pictorial, so that made it really easy to pick what to order! 

I would absolutely come back... to try the other menu items, as well as the Roti again!

Do you like loud bad music that hurts your ears & gives you a migraine? 

Do you like being cussed at and called names? 

Do you like being sexually harassed and stripped of your under garments? 

Do you like sweating balls all night? 

Then this is the bar for you!!!!!! 

I had never been here before but I honestly wish I had kept it that way. I had such a horrible time! When we walked in I noticed how loud the music was and not only was it loud the sound system was of bad quality. I was literally having to scream to converse with my friends. 

It was extremely hot it felt like there was not any air or AC circulating in the place so I was sweating like I had just ran a marathon. When I got home I literally pealed my clothes off!!!! 

We start ordering drinks and were just chillin and conversing still sipping on the first set of drinks we had ordered, then rudely one of the bartenders yells to one of my male friends hey cheapo you gonna buy another drink anytime soon or just stand there and stare! OMG WTF how rude we were not even finished with our 1st set of drinks! 

So I decide to do some shots with my friends and make the most of the night. Every time I would walk to the bar the female bartenders were harassing me to come on the bar and dance with them. 

After 4 or 5 shots I told them I might consider getting up there, well they took that literally and after about my 4th shot they were pulling me up there forcing me to dance! I was too embarrassed not to dance after already being pulled up so I was like what the hell! So I started dancing and this bartender who I am dancing with on the bar comes up and starts rubbing on my tatas. Then attempts to pull my bra off! 

I was like oh hell no, but there was no telling her no she was so forceful and had I fought it, I would have had some ripped flesh!!! She then threw it up with the rest of the bras they had stolen from other women! I was so pissed at this point I got off the bar and ran to the bathroom and got myself together. 

I was not even wearing a top that was appropriate without a bra so I go back to the bar and ask for it back they rudely said nope not gonna happen! I spent the rest of the night braless and feeling like I was just sexually harassed! 

I understand that may be the bar Motto is to confiscate the bra of a woman who is coarse to get on stage and dance. However there is a difference between playful gestures and inappropriate disrespect of the human body. 

The gag was on me, had no clue about the "bra" must come off policy upon entering this bar. 

You could NOT pay me to come back to this place!

Rick just finished cleaning my bedroom, hallway, and vehicle all for a super reasonable deal. 

I found his company on Yelp and only after calling a few local competitors first. When I tried calling other places they were giving me excuses such as "3 room min., can't offer you anything else, can't work around days off, etc" not willing to work with me on what I needed which is ONE room regardless of pricing. 

Rick was much more flexible. He offered for the price quoted to clean the room specifically, outside hallway area, and to give me my full money's worth he also cleaned my car. 

My car is not exactly new (2005) and it looks amazing!!! inside. I'll post a few photos. I had caked on stains, food traces on the mats, and other crap. It looks/smells like new. Not to mention he worked on that in my driveway in this blazing heat. 

Rick and his company are-
Mobile
Flexible (scheduling)
Professional
Felt safe (as a woman home alone)
Affordable
No toxic odors left over
Works via word of mouth
and does an amazing job of cleaning up. I've heard he's especially great with pet stains but I don't have a pet. 

I fully intend to use him as well when I move across town from Mountains Edge to Henderson. 

If you need your household, car interior, office, or any other carpeted space cleaned... don't look anywhere else. 
5 Stars!

There was the frantic call from my son in the middle of the night...."Mom, Starr is gone!"  Feeling helpless, I did what I could from LA while my son and his friends tirelessly combed the neighborhoods, made flyers and enlisted the help of every social networking site out there including Reddit to find our beloved wandering doggy senior citizen.  She is almost 17 years old and we were well aware that she has had dwindling vision and hearing, putting her more at risk of an unfortunate ending to this story.  

Happily, we discovered our little scamp had managed to roam 8 miles from home in a relatively short period of time, was picked up by the Las Vegas Animal Control and taken to Lied Shelter. 

My son zipped down to pick her up and was greeted by a very grateful staff.  They were very kind and helpful to him and said that they had a very busy morning with many more animals than usual needing a temporary home at the shelter. They also said that they were very glad Zachary B. came down to pick her up because, they confided, many elderly dogs are just let go by their owners so that the owners don't have to put them down themselves, horrifying as this may sound.  

Zachary B. paid a mere $45 to spring her from the slammer after her microchip identified him as the owner (I had called at 1 am to update all of that information with a very responsive, helpful and kind Home Again staffer). She looked unphased by all of it and the staff at Lied proclaimed her to be a very sweet dog.  We all knew that, but it was nice of them to notice!  Having her microchipped allowed Zach to pick her up that day instead of waiting.  Also, I bought a package from Home Again for $17.  They notified by mass email all vets, pet stores and others within a 25 mile radius of where she was last seen.  Zach and friends called several vets offices before she was located and they all said that they knew about this dog. I Very  Highly recommend Home Again!! 

A really nice touch:  I had left a voicemail at 12:30 am at the shelter.  They returned my call at 1 pm.  Very impressive!  The shelter has a website that posts photos of animals who are there with a very user friendly filter so that you can search for your pet.  The only thing is that the shelter is so inundated with animals - 50 TO 60 PER DAY GENERALLY. EVEN WEEKENDS - that they cannot complete the intake of the animal for about 24 hours post arrival.  The best thing to do on the first day that your pet is missing is to go to the shelter to see if your baby is waiting there for you.  All's well that ends well. Boy and his dog are blissfully reunited.

***Todd English PUB offers many entrees that are not that expensive when compared to other celebrity chef backed Vegas restaurants, but the food was mediocre; I will probably seek out Todd English's Olives (The Bellagio) instead on my next Vegas trip***

We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB.  I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).

The atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).

The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.

We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.

I also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.

I tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.

Service was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).

Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.

Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.

Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).

***Hotel Palomar Phoenix is a very upscale hotel with a great location in Downtown Phoenix; it is also, like several Phoenix hotels, very reasonably priced***

Phoenix in the summer is very hot and Downtown Phoenix is slightly sleepy for a Downtown area, but it is a great option for a reasonably priced weekend getaway.  High-end food and hotels in Phoenix are quite inexpensive compared to other big and more sought cities.  While Phoenix's food and attractions (as well as the weather) might not measure up to cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles, it is a good value and worthwhile if you enjoy exploring new cities.

Kimpton's Hotel Palomar is a great option for your Phoenix stay.  It has a perfect location for Downtown Phoenix.  It is just a few steps away from the major sports venues located in Downtown Phoenix like Chase Field.  It is also within walking distance to popular and well-known Phoenix restaurants like Pizzeria Bianco.

In addition to its great location, Hotel Palomar is a great hotel from top to bottom.  The exterior is very modern and so is the lobby.  The lobby has a great look that is both very modern as well as very comfortable.  The front desk is friendly and free rental bikes are on display.

While I did not check out Hotel Palomar's fitness center, I did explore their upscale bar (Lustre Bar) and the pool area.  Lustre Bar is sleek and contemporary; the drinks and food menu even have a slight hipster vibe.  The pool area has a bar and lounge area and the pool is also stylish and hip like a Los Angeles pool scene.  During the summer, Hotel Palomar's pool is open to the public.

The rooms at Hotel Palomar are elegant and have a Las Vegas-esque feel with its combination of comfort, spaciousness and sleek decor.  There are great touches throughout their rooms like modern couches, very nice beds with padded leather headboards and a beautiful bathroom with a great floor and a very nice glass shower.  There is also a subtle use of decoration and color in the room to provide both an elegant and distinct look.

The room was very comfortable--very comfortable bed with great linens and a good room temperature (I think the room could have been a little cooler given the hot Phoenix weather).

Kimpton's loyalty program InTouch is a nice plus too because it is great for newcomers as well as elite members.  Unlike the major hotel loyalty programs like Marriott, Hilton and Starwood, Kimpton's InTouch program provides tangible benefits to regular members.  Just being an InTouch member gets you free Wi-Fi access as well as a $10 credit to the minibar, which is a great plus since so many people are afraid of even opening the minibar given its incredibly high prices.  The $10 credit gives you a lot of choice in the minibar.

There are other fun bonuses available to all guests like complimentary morning coffee and tea as well as a nightly complimentary wine reception.

Service at Hotel Palomar is very friendly and polished.

Room rates at Hotel Palomar are very reasonable.  Occasionally room rates are high here, but room rates are often surprisingly low.  Hotel Palomar would be twice or three times as much (maybe even more) if it was located in cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco.

I really enjoyed Hotel Palomar in Phoenix.  It was my second Hotel Palomar experience.  I have also been to the Hotel Palomar in San Francisco.  While I liked that hotel, Hotel Palomar Phoenix is a nicer property with bigger rooms and more amenities.  It is an excellent option for a business or pleasure stay in Downtown Phoenix.

Valet parking is available.

Bacchanal can be overwhelming since there are a LOT of dishes to choose from. Between Bacchanal & Wicked Spoon, if you only have time for one and care more about the selection - go to Bacchanal. (Save room for the CREPES!) 

THINGS I CRAVE: 1.) Lasagna, 2.) Prime Rib, 3.) Crepes, 4.) Machaca, 5.) Posole.

Personally, though, Wicked Spoon still wins in just a few minor areas: a few key dishes that are well executed, bone marrow at dinner, and smooth creamy gelato as opposed to the grainy ice cream at Bacchanal. It's also slightly less expensive, less crowded, and comes with much more consistently reliable service.

CONSENSUS: Would try to make time for both on my next trip to Vegas - Bacchanal for lunch, Wicked Spoon for dinner.

Oh wow. LOVE is one of the most enchanting shows I've seen in my life. You know that feeling when you are giddy like a child and your eyes are big and you can't help but smile? Yep, that was me for the entire span of LOVE.

I am a huge fan of The Beatles, but even if you aren't I think that this is a performance you would enjoy at any age. When Sir Nicholas and I left the show we asked each other our favorite parts and truth be told it was hard to name the ones we like best because we liked them all. But, we managed to narrow down some highlights and I'll put them here for you. If you've never seen LOVE and don't like things ruined for you don't read any further...

Nick loved two parts best, one was a reoccurring theme of VW Beatles that ended with one actually made of different parts on handles with performers holding each piece inside the vehicle. At one point the car breaks apart and all these dancers spill out using a wheel hub or hood as an accessory for their act. It was quick charming. The other part was a trampoline set where there were four trampolines in the floor and the performers used them along with nets and a big red English phone booth to do the most amazing acrobatic acts.

While I liked both of those acts, too I thought that a foursome on roller skate (Maybe roller blades? I don't know because I couldn't see the wheels thanks to their shaggy white boot covers.) that used ramps to do their tricks was amazing. They were all perfectly in sync with hitting the highs in the air and on their tricks. 

But, for the song that stole the show when put together with the act I'd have to say Lucy in the Sky was the hands down winner for me. This started with a giant sheet covering the entire audience that reminded me of being in elementary gym class. They withdrew the white covering and the entire theater looked light we were out in the night sky, but a trippy version. Then a lovely red headed girl along with accompanying aerialists performed their act that seemed to showcase the song beautifully.

The tickets range from $100 - $150 for performance I think and this is one show where I say the $150 is worth it. It's a memory that likely won't soon fade, especially if you've ever liked any Beatles tune at all.

Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.

I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).

I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium ("red in the center"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g

For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)

I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!

The Lion's Tail Tavern is a drink-forward, gaming bar with one of the best names around!

Billed as an American style cocktail bar with a Vegas twist, The Lion's Tail Tavern fits right in at Village Square.  It's a locals kind of establishment where I could easily see regulars coming to gamble a little while they get their drink on.  They are classier than the typical Vegas neighborhood bar, but still maintain a warm genuine feel. 

The Lion's Tail Tavern is straightforward in their approach--serving quality drinks (with some elevated options), lots of seats for gaming, big screens to watch the game, and of course... Golden Tee to keep things real.  Those familiar with this area of town may know Danny from Three Angry Wives.  One of the nicer bartenders around, he knows how to take care of players and is now the general manager at TLTT.

I also understand that you will be able to order from Bachi Burger (next door) to satisfy your hunger needs, and that they will bring your food over to you!

I don't frequent gaming bars, but had an enjoyable experience here.  5 stars for drinks, gaming, viewing and purity of focus.  If you're not into gaming this is probably not a spot you'll be dying to come back to, but if you're looking for another option to incorporate into your weekly routine they are solid option to play on West Sahara.

Unlike the Bouchon in Beverly Hills, the Las Vegas location is open for breakfast.  Located on the 10th floor of the Venetian hotel, Bouchon has a nice dining room.  High ceilings and a brasserie-like feel with the floor, decorations and specials on chalkboard.  Formal table settings with white tablecloth.  I think this Bouchon may also feature outdoor dining.

Bouchon's breakfast menu is reasonably priced (given its Las Vegas competition).  Most of their breakfast items run below $20.  You will probably pay anywhere from $12-$16 per dish at Las Vegas cafes and even though the portions would probably be bigger than what you will find at Bouchon, it is very likely that those same cafes would be using lower quality ingredients.

I went with the Croque Madame.  The sandwich was a toasted ham and cheese sandwich on brioche that was topped with a sunny side up egg and Mornay sauce.  The sandwich was okay.  It was tasty and filling, but I felt the Croque Madame at Comme Ca was much better.  Comme Ca's sandwich has a great toasted Gruyere cheese crust that is kind of like the cheesy top of baked lasagna.

Bouchon's version lacked that cheese top and it made the sandwich feel a little boring (also, the sandwich was a little dry on the edges--kind of like dry toast that has not been buttered).  The Mornay sauce (which Comme Ca's sandwich lacks) was okay, but it did not really do anything to make the sandwich stand out.  The egg was nicely cooked.

The french fries were good.  While the fries were good (hot, crisp and flavorful), they do kind of remind me of when you get a really good batch of McDonald's french fries.  Not that that's a bad thing.  McDonald's french fries are quite popular.  The portion of french fries here was very generous.

Service was very good.  Good hostess who was very accommodating and observant; also, a very polite and attentive waiter.

Las Vegas food is typically overpriced.  This Bouchon, on the other hand, is pretty similar (maybe slightly more expensive) than the Beverly Hills Bouchon.  You could easily eat much worse in Vegas in the same price range.  Because of that, Bouchon (for breakfast or dinner) is probably a good option for dining in Las Vegas even if I did not enjoy the food as much as I hoped.

Complimentary parking is available.  I used valet though I think self-parking is also available.

After getting into this funny invention called a "car," we were off and headed to Symphony Hall for what the Muggle Studies professor calls "an orchestra show."  We were told we had to fit in.  Imagine if thousands of witches and wizards arrived by broomstick.  Those muggles would be so scared.  They're clearly of faint-heart.  It was a whirl of colors and sounds and somehow we found ourselves in a brightly lit lobby.  It is almost as gorgeous as the Grand Hall at Hogwarts!  How muggles manipulate "electricity" is beyond me.  Clearly floating candles would be more majestic and appropriate.  

I wonder if Minister Shacklebolt warned the local muggles that Hogwarts was doing a special show in town.  There was a flurry of activities for the odd muggle children.  So many people were dressed as what they perceive wizards and witches look like.  How peculiar.  The Sorting Hat was in attendance and putting children in different houses.  There was also a wand making area where squibs can feel more like a witch or wizard as well.  Pointy metallic objects were being thrown around and I was worried that it'll gouge my eye out.  If one of the filthy little muggles threw it in my hair or my face, I would have thrown out a Bat-Bogey Hex regardless of the professor's watchful eye.  I later learned that the muggles call it "glitter."

The show started at 2:30PM and the lights turned off faster than you can say, "Nox!"  The professor and the Gryffindork with us couldn't find our seats and an usher had to help us.  Had we been allowed to cast "Lumos," we wouldn't need the silly muggle to help us with her portable tube-thing with the light on the end.  A wand is so much more classy.  I was half-expecting Filch and Mrs. Norris to pop out and give us all detention but lucky for us, the muggle was nice.  Anyways, it was an hour of beautiful music and the acoustics was amazing.  Not a bad seat in the place!  Who knew a trombone and a harp can make such hauntingly beautiful music?  They acted out a skit with two Hogwarts student against a witch from the dungeons who was out to steal the conductor's wand.  At one point they told everyone to stand up to help cast, "Expelliarmus."  Had the professor not been sitting to my left, I would have cast, "Avada Kedavra."  Clearly it's a sure-fire way to defeat a dark witch.

The show ended with a special tribute to a mouse.  Who even has a mouse anymore besides poor Ron Weasley?  I'm glad Scabbers died.  Anyways, the tribute was for a Mouse... a Mickey Mouse.  The composition was from Fantasia.  You can tell the muggle children were lost while the adults all had a look of nostalgia.  Anyways, now that I have Yelped my review instead of having to write a two-foot essay, extra credit is complete.

[Just got back from the "Halloween at Hogwarts" show today if you couldn't tell.  Please don't take my Elite badge away because of my nerdom.  Toodles from The Slytherin Empress!]

WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words "350 Pounds and Over Eat Free" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or "HAG" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Afternoon with my daughter who was feeling under the weather and decided some good hot tea would be a good remedy...of course a honey toast wouldn't hurt either :) The cool Asian hipster coffee bar is a nice change from our usual Starbucks stop.
Plenty of seating with power strip along window tables and walls to encourage plug ins.
A small dessert display with a few tempting treats left. Menu is hand written in chalk and prices are mom & pop shop prices... $7 for a pot of tea...hmmm this better be good.
Be sure to download the Epoxy app, it works as a mobile stamp card. You get 1 free after 9.
My daughter ordered a pot of hot Fiji tea. It is brought out to our table in a pretty glass pot with a tea light holder. Fragrant green tea with delicate notes of papaya and pineapple. Soothing warm comfort, but a bit extravagant at $7.
I wanted something cold so I got the green SerenADE. It comes in a cute bottle with a cork cap and the most refreshing drink of green grapes. Why is this drink not on more menus?? It is like drinking summer in...so light and an "ahhh" in every sip! I would definitely get this over and over again. I can't wait to try the red SerenADE made with red grapes.
The honey toast was a legendary Yelp favorite that had me drooling as soon as I saw the pictures. Heck yes we were trying it!! Fluffy bread, vanilla ice cream, honey, butter...these are 4 of my favorite things. It was good...really good. Toasted cube of bread with a buttery soft center and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream with the added gooey goodness of honey drizzled all over. Yes, this was a sugar overload but my sweet tooth took over and then all that was left was a small puddle of vanilla ice cream among scraps of bread. I think my daughter managed to get some lol. We came home and both sugar crashed.
My wife got jealous we went without her, especially after seeing our pictures. So like the good wife I am, I will make the sacrifice and take her this weekend :)

PRO TIP: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! 

Wait a minute... maybe im on an acid flashback trip... those colors are grooooooooovieeeeeeeeyyyy... wait a minute how can I be on a flash back when I haven't taken acid ever... ohhh man... what was in that sample...  holy chit giant M&Ms are coming to eat me!!!  Run hurry move it ... ohhhhhhh noooooooo!!! 

PSA: So yeah if you feel compelled to buy things you don't need and won't wear ever again... don't come here!

Well I finally made it out of that pysho room and back to normal swag rooms... t shirts, hats, plush toys... OHHH look rednekz it's a NASCAR reproduction of the M&Ms sponsored ride... go take a picture or see if you can put it in your suitcase... wouldn't it look good up on blocks in front of the trailer with all the dogs shading underneath it?

On that note... yeah this was obviously not my type of fun. Granted its nice looking out the 4th story windows at the ants errrr M&Ms errrr people down below...

A friend and I stayed at the Excalibur when we were in town to see a concert.  I hadn't been in Las Vegas for many years and, quite honestly, thought the idea of themed hotels was kind of dumb.  Well, I must admit that the theme does serve to differentiate this hotel from the myriad of others that line the strip and it was kind of fun, in a kitschy way, to see how thoroughly they played out the theme.

My friend is a poker player and spent some time down in their poker area and even won money.  She taught me to play the quarter poker machines and I even tried my hand at Pai-Gow but I don't think I'll ever be the gambler she is.

The Starbucks next to poker area did a fabulous job of keeping us caffeinated and the food court upstairs did an admirable job of providing me with Chinese food and cinnamon rolls, even into the wee hours of the morning.  

There is a free tram that runs between here and te Luxor and Mandalay Bay (I think) and it's right across the street from the MGM Grand where we attended the concert.

The room was not fancy, but it was cheap and got the job done.

My favorite thing about this hotel was that the bathrooms had Dyson air blade hand dryers that dried my hands in about 5-10 seconds, no lie.  I've never used hand dryers that worked so quickly.

Despite all the locals claiming this place is over rated, I felt that this was a place we still needed to check out for ourselves.  The staff was super nice & I even got a chance to say hi to the nice lady who is on all the food shows when they visit Pittsburgh.  Primanti Brothers is a cool place to park the car, grab a bite and take a walk to all the different stands on the surrounding streets.

 As far as the food goes I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed either.  The sandwiches were just, OK.  The bread was freshly baked, the cold cuts were good but I guess what didn't do it for me was the cold soggy bland under cooked fries they crammed in the sandwich.  Now if your gonna have a sandwich as simple as that without so much as some mayo or some kind of dressing everything needs to be money.  

Any time I'm in an area where I can grab a cold Yuengling beer & some homemade chilli cheese fries (ironically enough our fries for the appetizer were cooked to perfection) I'm a happy camper.  I'm glad that I got a chance to cross Primanti Brothers off the list and would suggest a visit if you have never been and your in the area.

It's been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow Yelpers :^)

======Smoky Goodness Alert========

Be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of Pork on a Fork!!  It is highly addictive in intoxicating, so dinners beware!  

Pork on a Fork has the BEST PULLED PORK sandwich in Phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire Universe!!  Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs, Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages, but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork!  

You can not beat their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is HUMONGOUS~ almost enough for two people!  It's so moist, tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you'll want it for for yourself! It comes with two sides.  I recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their BBQ Beans!  These BBQ Beans are cooked in Heaven ~ sent by angels down to earth and given to Pork on a Fork to sell to their customers!  :^)  Well, maybe that's a stretch but their BBQ Beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning. 

If you have tried Pork on the Fork yet, you don't know what you're missing.  Once you've tried them for lunch, you'll find yourself wanting more and caan't wait for your next visit!  I hope to see you there.

After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. 

We ordered a "Quesadilla" priced at $10 and "Empanadas" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! 

They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.

There are two times every year when Las Vegas Blvd shuts down to vehicular traffic. The first time is New Years Eve, when you can be sexy while teetering in sky high heels. The second is during the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, when you can be sexy while huffing and puffing in running shoes. 

I signed up for the 1/2 marathon this year, and this was my first time running with the crowds rather than catering to them in the hotel at work at. Since The Great Marathon Disaster of 2011, it looks like this shindig has shaped up for the better. The registration, expo, and actual event process all went smoothly for me with no hiccups and since the course was flat, there were no surprise hills or valleys to throw me off my pace, which is also great for first-time racers like myself.

As much as I enjoyed the event, I did have a few gripes in the lack of respect for the road from both runners and spectators. Runners would stop to walk abruptly and either in the middle of the road, or on the left. Folks, remember freeway etiquette and move to the right if you're going to slow up traffic. There were also tourists who thought that crossing the street in the middle of the marathon would be the most appropriate time of all. This is a huge no no and a safety hazard for both parties involved.

Thinking about running the full, 1/2, or half of the half next year? Here are a few tips -
+ Register early. Man, marathons are where the money's at! The sooner you commit to the mileage, the cheaper it'll be.
+ Attend the expo to pick up your bib & gear on Friday; the mass of out-of-towners come on Saturday.
+ Stick to your assigned corral. The whole point of having corrals is so we don't all run at the same time. But I guess some people didn't get that. 
+ Study the course map in advance and set up a designated reunion point with friends and family - after the race is over, you're on your own, baby. 
+ Take care of your body before, during, and after the race. You have your usual suspects: drink water, get enough rest, train in advance, etc. but don't forget to massage your muscles post-run too! 
+ ENJOY! When else can you run up Las Vegas Blvd without the fear of being hit by a car!?

At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. 

For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan. 

Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat. 

While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.

AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.

Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!
As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. 
That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. 
Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.

Now onto the food shall we?

I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...

Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! 

Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!

Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more 

Butter sauted scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!

Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.

Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! 

Other notable dishes included:
Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2
Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2
Foie gras egg custard 10
Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2
Iberico Pork 10 x2
Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)

All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!

Happy Eats!

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

"You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass." - Isoroku Yamamoto

All the men that work here have served their country. Tip them well! 

70 years after D-Day I came here to celebrate my daughter's high school graduation. I opted for the D-day package while my daughter had the G.I. Jane. 

We were picked up by an authentic military humvee. No A/C but I was told by the mid of June all the humvees will have doors, a roof, and A/C. The driver and my trainer were beyond courteous and very welcoming. The training is thorough and you are given the opportunity to load and cock your own weapon. In addition, the trainer makes sure there are plenty of photo ops. You can also take pics with the helicopter and vehicles outside. 

When I think of World War 2, "Saving Private Ryan" and "Pearl Harbor" come to mind. So many have made the ultimate sacrifice. Their weapons have always fascinated me and in this moment I was able to shoot the same weapons our American soldiers used to fight the Germans and Japanese. The M1 Garand is an amazing rifle. Plenty of power and by far my favorite weapon because of it's historic value and accuracy. I got all head shots! The Thompson looks so easy in the movies. But once you pull that trigger and let the auto loose you are spraying the target. Oh what a blast that was! 

My daughter did well. Head shots and red targets. Her favorite was the Colt M4 because of the scope and it reminded her of playing call of duty. 

The weapon selection is extensive. P90, MP5, ACR, Scar, MG, and so on and so on. There's so many to choose from! There are about a dozen packages available. Even one for the kids with weapons using .22. I can't wait to come back and try a .50 sniper rifle. This is a definite adrenaline rush and an experience you can't miss! Boom!

Two and a half years and another dozen visits since my initial review, StripSteak remains one of the top new American steakhouses in Vegas.

For starters, do not pass up the foie sliders.  This signature dish is topped with a tangy pineapple chutney and sweet onion jus that perfectly balance the richness of the foie.  Incredible.  The Kobe beef carpaccio, finished with south east Asian flavors is delicious.  Different from most, the coconut and Thai chili focuses the flavor of the raw beef and brings out its natural sweetness.  The duck confit spring rolls and Maine lobster fritters are also worth a try.

Sadly, A5 grades of beef are no longer offered.  The most flavorful of their current steaks is the American Kobe rib cap.  Sublime beef flavor.  Heady umame from the wood burning grill.  Great texture.  Add a side of roasted marrow bones and you're in beef heaven.   (I promise I don't eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti). 

Non-beef mains?  Who knows.  You don't go to a steakhouse to eat chicken or fish.

Desert?  No room.

The wine list is outstanding, with a lot of gems from around the world.  Vegas resort pricing except for more expensive bottles where the markup is low.  

Very Important:  The typical guest at this hip steakhouse has a lot of, how to put it,  disposable income.  The sommeliers try not to insult guest by asking how much they want to spend but rather make recommendations based on the caliber of the first bottle selected.  Save yourself the grief, Speak clearly and tell them what you want to spend.  Its not fun to be presented with an unexpected four figure wine tab.

Service remains excellent.

Highly Recommended

They say the middle of the road is a good place to get hit, but that's where I am with this place.   

The Bad: 
1. We were seated at the smallest table ever to be in a restaurant, I think the Guinness Book sticker was on the side of it. 
2. Then we were handed two large "book style" menus, a sushi menu, a drink menu, and a sinner special menu.    Just shuffling all that paper made us a little crazy.  SIMPLIFY PEOPLE!
3. One of the items we order was brought to us on a plate that was so large that it hung over the side of the tiny table. Very dumb because there was no reason other than "looking cool" in the kitchen when they made it.
4. A little pricey for what you get.

The Good:
1. The bacon wrapped scallops (only 2 for $8.50) were awesome. The best I've ever had.
2. The waiter was very helpful with drink and food suggestions. (Keep in mind that he seemed to see we were having a tough time flipping through all FOUR menus.)
3. The Red roll was out of this world.
4. The place itself is as nice as your gonna find in any strip mall in AZ.

See, 4 good points and 4 not so good points.  This one is up to you to check out and see for yourself.

Yagyu, Yama Sushi, Yellowtail, Yonaka, Yoshinoya, Yummy, Yusho, Yu-Yu, Yuzu.  There are many Japanese restaurants in Vegas that begin with a Y.  Some are much more authentic than others, and some are definitely more delicious.  While Yuzu comes in last place alphabetically, they are near the top of the list when it comes to their food.  Yuzu would also probably get you more points in Scrabble than the other restaurants.  

The service is friendly and quite attentive.  This is not really an entree style restaurant, it's best to go with friends and order multiple dishes and share family style.  We tried many things, so I'll just go through each of them:

Sashimi Salad Yuzu Style - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, carrot, celery, cucumber, radish sprouts and seasonal vegetables.  The description doesn't do it justice: It's like a Japanese mini- taquito or flauta, but instead of meat & cheese wrapped in a tortilla, it's julienned veggies arranged lengthwise and wrapped in sashimi, served on top of greens.  The presentation rocked my socks.

Cold Green Tea Buckwheat Noodles - The noodles had a good texture and firmness, but green tea noodles typically don't float my boat.  Because it's hard to float on noodles.  And I don't have a boat.

Yellowtail Jalapeno - Good, but many restaurants have this.

Halibut Carpaccio -  Instead of a typical soy or citrus sauce, the halibut was served in a basil sauce.  Good flavor and texture, the basil wasn't overpowering.  Just enough to tickle your fancy.

Yuba Sashimi - The menu notes that this is limited to five servings a day; all tofu is made in-house, and this is the tofu skin resulting from that.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but I'm a bigger fan of the zaru tofu.  Still, it's good to try what homemade tofu tastes like to see if it tickles your pickle.

Zaru Tofu - Zaru means basket, and tofu means tofu.  Yuzu's house made tofu is served in a basket with some grated veggies.  Put the toppings on the tofu, pour a bit of the zaru sauce on it, mix and eat.  The sauce was like a less salty, slightly sweet soy sauce.  I liked this dish a lot; if the Yuba Sashimi tickles your pickle, this will turn your pickle into a cucumber.

Chicken Karaage - Good rendition of karaage.  Not too oily, the chicken was flavorful and moist.

Salmon Collar - This was cooked very well.  The salmon was not dry at all.  Not a dish I typically order though.

Yuzu Sorbet - Yum, yum, yum.  This is a perfect treat for summer, plenty of refreshing yuzu flavor.

Black Sesame Pudding - Tasted just like black sesame, but didn't float my boat (pudding buoyancy, lack of boat)

Soy Milk Pudding - Tasted like soy milk.  Nothing wrong with it, pudding just doesn't teeter my totter.

Unlike other restaurants, Yuzu's menu is not large, it consists of a single sheet of paper, double sided.  The above represents a good chunk of the menu, and everything was executed well.  Although many dishes are served with a sauce, nothing is over powering.  Flavors can be delicate, but are balanced.  One visit has already made me a fan, and I can't wait to go back.

I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.

You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. 

Then they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.

My friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. 

The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. 

The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were "normal" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. 

*I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino.

I spotted this Thai restaurant on the road and decided to stop by to grab dinner. It was during peak hour so the small venue was packed with people waiting to be seated by the door. The dim lit atmosphere was warm and inviting. Quite the contrast when I asked for a table for one. Their male servers seemed more concerned with the bigger parties, but the lone female server was friendly and made me feel welcomed.  

I started off with the Papaya Salad ($10) served with shredded papaya, cabbage, carrots, green beans, scallions, grilled shrimps, tomato, chili, lime, and fish sauce. The dish was crisp, feisty spicy, with hints of peanut flavors here and there. The fish sauce flavor was noticeable, but weighted down given the amount of explosive spiciness. I thought adding a handful of basil could provide that welcoming lift, but I did enjoy the differential textures and the grilled jumbo shrimps immensely. 

Next, I tried the Spicy Mussels ($15). The plate full of mussels were sauted in a roasted chili sauce, jalapeno, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, bell peppers, and zucchini. The mussels were fresh, spicy, and the sweet zucchini gave it a nice contrast. 

It was a pleasant surprise to find Sticky Rice ($2) to go with the meal. Overall, the prices were very steep for Thai food. Even though the ingredients were freshly prepared, the spicy flavors still lacked the striking complex aroma that made me fell in love with Thai cuisine in the first place. The experience was very Westernized so this might still be a welcoming experience for a large segment of the population. The server was very nice to provide me a frequent user card, but I don't think I will return anytime soon. 2.5 stars.

Two caveats: 1. I have little-to-no experience with Indo-Chinese and 2. Anywhere in Charlotte with more than 10 options for veggies gets an obligatory additional star.

But. Seriously. Where have you been all my life, Manchurian Pakora? This dish has no Western equivalent. Frying shreds of veggies coated in chickpea flour to crisp dumpling-land, then drowning them in a savory, spicy gravy - smothered in bird's eye chilis - hot damn, that's heaven in a stainless steel wok. 

All the entrees are. Served in woks, that is, on small metal stands. Neat! 

So yeah, there's the blacked-out-window massage parlor, strip joint, and lingerie shop all within a stone's throw of Fu Lin, but hey, that's what I like to call East Charlotte Panache. It's ok. Rent, in this strip mall, is obviously low (Don Pedro's is a two second walk away from here, home of even frugaler, if not quite as delicious, eats). Means you can get a ton of tasty food for cheap - unless you're ordering a paneer dish, or something seafoody, most of your options are 9 bucks a pop. Soups are either 2 or 4 - the larger price is a huge bowl for two.

The options for us veggies are endless. If it's not on the menu as vegetarian, and it's in any way possible to prepare it vegetarian, they'll make it for you. Guy was emphatic about the "made to order from scratch" concept. He also did an awesome job of explaining the differences in Manchurian rather than Chili preparations, how they spice things for various orders (ie, dried versus fresh chili), all that good stuff that you want to hear when you're an annoying, inquisitive, first-time partaker of any new cuisine. 

Lettuce wraps (on the menu why? Don't care, only place in CLT to get it with tofu) were just as I've had elsewhere, except no pine nuts. Still tasty. Nothing we ordered, meat or veg, failed to surpass expectations - but beware - medium spicy is not your typical medium. Had some crying peeps at the table by the end of the meal, including moi - but that's how I like it.

The best damn popcorn I've ever had. Seriously! 
The 505 is caramel popcorn coated in white chocolate and dusted with green and red hatch chilies.

The 505 is sweet, spicy and oh so addicting. I went through my big bag in ten minutes. 

Located on the south side of Vegas, Popped is a gourmet popcorn shop that has a huge amount of some of the most creative, insanely delicious popcorn I've ever had. They have at least fifteen different flavors (including specials) that you can sample before you purchase. And sample I did. Just look at all I tried. I tasted popcorn with white chocolate and coconut. Popcorn with jalapenos. Popcorn with caramel and apples. Popcorn with sea salt and vinegar. I truly got popcorn wasted. In the end, my wife and I bought four bags. This is what we took home with us:

505- Caramel popcorn coated in white chocolate & dusted w/ green & red hatch chilies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=chiThLLPBz2aAGrBzM1o3A

Dill Pickle Popcorn- Tasted just like dill pickles. This one's for you, Chris D. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=Xh4sd5IkeabqzZpo-Dsa2Q
S'mores Popcorn- Caramel corn with graham crackers, marshmallows and premium Swiss chocolate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=giCcRVvmtaZBV3F02KorGA

Honestly, I've never tried popcorn this amazing, and I've had lots of different popcorn in my time. I'm actually going to buy some from their website to be shipped to my home soon. It's that good. 

The prices at Popped are cheap. A small bag ranges from three bucks up to five. Large bags range from five to seven or so. 
The girl working the day I went was so friendly and willing to let us try all we wanted. So cool. 

If you can't make it to Vegas to try this place, I would hop on their site and buy a few bags. Seriously, do it. You won't regret it.

My favorite spot to chillax and unwind in Vegas! The only Korean spa in town, and they do a bang up job of keeping it awesome.

I've been here a few times in the past when I really need to get away. When the Groupon became available, I jumped at the opportunity. It may not look like much from the outside, but inside, it's high brow all the way.

After checkin, always make sure to give them your ID in order to get a pair of slippers to use around the gym. And shower before using the spa, hot tub, and before going upstairs to the communal area (and please dress in your given uniform before heading up!)

Upstairs in the communal area, there are a bunch of rooms heated to high temperatures to get you to sweat out the toxins. My favorite room is the one with the little balls that you can lie on! When it gets too hot, head on over to the ice room to cool off.

There are recliners and tv's where you can chill. In addition, there is a small cafe where you can buy food items. After sweating out a lot, I like to pass out on a recliner :D

Great fun, and you can stay from opening to closing if you want, but a few hours should be more then enough. Great to go with friends and family as well!!

Gordon Ramsay Burger is not your usual burger place, it fit well with the vegas strip.

Amazing sweet potato fries, those were some of the best I had ever eat, it mix with vanilla powder, and the fries below of the cone were not as tasty and a bit overcooked.  Our group orders two burger, the farm and hell burger.  The burger was probably 1/3lb, there not big but just about right if you eating solo.  The buns were sesame both side; first time I see this in a burger bun.  It reminds me like those sesame bagel.  I was not a fan of those burger bun but there were definite unusual, the hell burger were supposed to be very spicy, so I told to lower the spice.  The spice level came way out very weak and defeat the purpose.  

The service was good, refill water quick.  However was annoyed by their keep trying to sell us the dessert menu.  The food is good but not worth the price tag, since this is the strip is not a bad deal, despite burger cost $15 and fries were almost $10.  After all Subway nearby cost as much $10 for a foot long isn't such bad trade off.  The check comes with a ipod with a thank you message from Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant atmosphere was modern inside, but the attraction is the big frame display of the restaurant. If you hungry.  If you are very hungry, better off goes to buffet or something, this however is a great  mid night meal after a club or a show.

Tips:
Bring you total reward card, it save you $1 from any items in the menu.

Five things you can do while waiting for your Showtime Shuttle to depart...

1) Learn how to crochet and make your not yet born child a blanket. After that you can procreate and give birth in the shuttle.

2) Research your entire Vegas trip via your Yelp app, as well as plan your next two vacations and 20th wedding anniversary. Sure you haven't gotten married yet, but you really do have the time to kill.

3) Give a lecture on the meaning of life to complete strangers and form your own shuttle cult. Make sure you give everyone their own glass of Kool-Aid. It's really hot and who doesn't like drinking Kool-Aid?

4) Write your New York Times best selling book on theory of time travel. Because guess what, you're never going to get this hour back unless you know that white haired doctor from "Back To The Future."

5) Write your Yelp review about your less than stellar Showtime Shuttle experience.

On a positive note they do operate late at night when other shuttles are not running, plus it's way cheaper than taking a cab. BUT the next time I'm in LV I'm definitely going to take a cab so I can get on with my life. It was a 45 minute wait until we departed and then they stop at many, many, many hotels until they drop you off.

Strip hotels $8 one way / $14.50 round trip
Downtown & West hotels $9.50 / $17.50 round trip

Nothing could be more serious than what I'm about to say... Listen. Up. 

We have been using another local print shop for several years that shall go unnamed because of how much I hate them. They're nice, talented people for the most part, especially Robert, but holy hell I don't understand how they stay in business. We used them despite them. In the most recent situation that draws my ever-loving ire, they sent us a half order and accused us of losing the other half. Then, we tried to switch over to Impact, who on two occasions ignored my requests for a quote. That was awesome. 

So I begin to scour the Interwebs, high and lo, begging, praying, beseeching the Gods above for a printing company to just be effing awesome. 

Lo and behold, such a company exists. The Heavens parted, angels sang to Odysseus' Sirens, and I found O'neil. O'neil is the real deal and if you don't get your stuff printed here you're evil. It doesn't matter if you've never heard of them. Even if you don't need stuff printed, you should make something up and send it here. 

They're hyper local and by that I mean they're not only local but locally EMPLOYEE owned. Yeah boooooiiiii!

They've been in business for about 103 years or some crazy number to which I can hardly count. If you want to know the truth, I think in the future, I used a time machine to go back to the past to influence my future by founding this company that year just so that 100 years later I could look like a genius for finding such a great company to print our shite. 

In case you need to visually verify the veracity of my claims, pull a Cosmo Kramer like I did and just bust down their front door. It's probably not locked though they claimed upon my departure there'd be a "Dallas G" policy.  

I'm so happy. Even if they send me a box of flaming dog excrement they'll have done it with way more class, style, and responsiveness than the others in town. 

O'Neil for President!

It's my 100th review, and I saved it for XS!

We heard that there wasn't a guestlist for this new club, as everyone and their mommas were trying to get in. We decided to get in line at 9:30pm, and there was already a line formed along the wall. Thankfully, some people from our group came earlier in the day and scored the ladies free tickets. Woot!

The guys opted to get a table and do bottle service in order to get in. The table they reserved was right along the pool, with 2 lounge beds in the water, and a shallow area where we could dance! My feet were thankful for this, as I had been wearing 4-inch heels for the past 3 nights. I think I was the first one in the water, I was so excited! 

The first week of November offered the perfect weather. It was sunny in the day time, and just right at night. Half of the nightclub is outdoors and it wouldn't have been as enjoyable once it started getting cold. Really though, this club was gorgeous. There were booths, cabanas, and even rooms that opened out to the club that you could reserve. They really catered to parties of all sizes. There was even a casino area in the middle of the pool. Some drunk-tard decided against walking around the pool to get there... he jumped in and swam across the pool instead!

Drinks were yummy. I renewed my love for vodka here.. especially Belvedere vodka. After 3 shots and 2 vodka cranberries, I was on a mission... to get my dance on! Too bad the music was off. It went from Trance, to Reggaeton, to... who the hell knows? Can you play some hip-hop please? If anything is a buzz kill, it's bad music. 

None-the-less I had an amazing time at XS. It was all a blurr by the end of the night... and I can't wait to do it all over again!

Authentic, Home Cookin' Korean!

As you can see from my photo, I'm a white dude, but growing up around lots of Korean friends and culture, I definitely know my way around a few H.O.T. albums and jars of kimchi in the garage.  The food at Mashisoyo is homey and authentic in the best way.


The owners greeted me with sincere smiles as I walked in for dinner on a Thursday evening with a friend.  We sat down in front of a TV playing some K-pop stuff, which is still entertaining, even if your Korean isn't so good.  

We ordered the Seafood Soon Dobu (tofu soup), and the Haemul Paejun (scallion and seafood pancake).  The Pancake was HUGE, and full of lots of tasty shrimp, calamari, and octopus.  I like my Paejan crispy, and because of the size of this one, some parts could have been cooked a little longer, but it was still very tasty.  The soon dobu was delicious, and had more seafood than Finding Nemo. Lots of mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari made this eat more like a stew than a soup.  It was hearty and spicy and wonderful. 

Mashisoyo is hidden in a small shopping center across the street from Walmart and next to a Tropical Smoothie place on Ft. Apache. 

  Make sure you come check out this repeat-visit-worthy, mom and pop tofu stop!!

After a week of attending this yoga studio, I was no longer able to ignore my loudly-clanging bullshit detector, and had to quit. Nothing personal against this particular franchise...my beef is with Bikram yoga in general. Doing a Bikram class feels like working out at the Jonestown Athletic Club!

Bikram devotees strike me as slightly brainwashed in their adherence to the cult of Bikram. This is reinforced at the end of every class, when everyone utters a monotone "Namaste" in unison, while laying flat on the floor with heels touching and palms out. Heaven's Gate, anyone? 
 
Another thing I found creepy is that the instructors are required to recite pretty much word-for-word from a script. Funny quips and jokes are more robotic, less funny when you've heard them over and over ("Japanese ham sandwich"). They also have to repeat Bikram's mangled English ("Put your exactly forehead to your knee"). Exactly forehead? WTF is that?
 
I'm not blaming the instructors -- it's Bikram himself (Bikram Choudhury, who devised this regimen in the early '70s) who insists that all his franchisees follow his shtick TO THE LETTER if they want to keep teaching. Yes that's right -- FRANCHISEES; it's a freakin' FRANCHISE that will set you back $10,000 and then $1,000 a month. That's in addition to the $10,500 fee for taking the required instructors' course. Think of all the Bikram studios across the U.S. The humble yogi is raking it in!
 
Well, at least he's honest about it. Direct quote from Bikram: "Bikram yoga is so big. This is a bathroom slipper you buy (for) $2 in Kmart. But you put Bikram on it, it'll sell for $35 in a second." I'll give him props for his balls. Oh, speaking of his balls, here's another direct quote: "I'm beyond Superman. I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody fucks with me."
 
Indeed, back in 2000 he sued a couple of yoga techers in CA for teaching a modified version of Bikram (they had the audacity to add music and lower the thermostat in the room from the sacrosanct 105 degrees, 40% humidity). The case was settled out of court.
 
In addition to these ethical quibbles, I'm not so sure about the health benefits of doing a strenuous workout in a 105-degree room. They say I will sweat out all the "toxins" in my system. As far as I know, sweat is just salt and water. I didn't see any booze, shrooms or trans fats rolling down my face.
 
I was going to finish my 30-day trial membership at Bikram Yoga Summerlin, just to give it a fair shake. Maybe I'd end up getting over my reservations, lose 10 pounds, become more grounded, and be able to sleep well again....??? 
 
Then I came to my senses and went back to Las Vegas Athletic Club... which costs me $9/month and offers a variety of un-copyrighted, unpretentious yoga classes. Holla!

Some of the best tacos I've ever had... But I have to update from my last review. It actually makes me sad to do this but my experience last night must be put out there. Here we go...

Came here last night around 7pm to grab some shrimp tacos (3 to be exact) and 1 shrimp burrito. The guy who took my order didn't speak a word of English, which is to be expected but not understanding the sentence "3 shrimp tacos on corn tortilla" isn't acceptable. 
So he starts the shrimp on the grill grabs one tortilla and says "what it". I remind him it's 3 tacos. He looks confused and had to ask someone what I was saying. He says ok gets three tortillas. He had to remake the first one 3 times because he kept putting the wrong thing on them. The shrimp is done and he puts exactly two shrimp pieces on each taco. When I've been here in the past there was always at least 6-7 pieces. When I try to ask him about this he shrugged. I decided to try and talk to someone else. He then proceeds to mess up the buritto as well by putting guac on it which I said no to. I get to the cashier and it got worse...
I walk up and attempt to explain my situation to her, I even show her the amount of shrimp on my tacos. She laughs, snatches my debit card out of my hand and charges me right away. It was $20. She charged me for the tacos he messed up and the guac on the buritto. Now the money is not the issue here, it's the fact she laughed and literally took my debit card from me without my permission. I did not sign the receipt so I will be filling a statement with my bank. 
This was unexceptable. I have never been treated like this as a passing customer and I will never return.

You guys have heard all the hype. All the awards, national media attention, the famous chefs of the world saying how great this place it. Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!

I've read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..

Places like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says "this is drunken noodles." At LoS, it still says  "this is drunken noodles", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..)

Whenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn't just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!

Nothin like some bbq after a workout huh? lol. 

My friend recommended this place and wanted to try it out. So we had no idea what to get. We ended up sharing a 3 meat platter. Which was a bit much for two of us. We didn't even finish it. lol. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and chicken, with a side of the creamed corn and Mac & Cheese. So my favorite was probably the pulled pork. This thing was amazing. & the sauce that they have will blow you away. Try the hot and sweet sauce that they have! The mac and cheese was also reallyyyyy delicious. I wasn't too fond of the chicken because I thought it was a bit dry. 

I definitely want to come back for happy hour! Those bbq nachos look bomb! The customer service was spectacular. I wish I remembered our server's name because he was super friendly and helpful with the menu. Very knowledgeable and always made sure we got everything we needed. I'll be back for more! =)

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

This review is long overdue! A friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for a pedicure so I called for an appointment and got placed with Tami. 

My experience was relaxing from start to finish. Tami (the owner) is very friendly and good at what she does. She had recently opened after years of working in the hotels doing luxury pedicures. She has brought her experience in that arena to the strip mall. If you're looking to be pampered with a high end spa quality pedicure without breaking the bank, this is your place! 

The pedicure that I had was amazing! The products that they use are high quality along with the heavenly smells... Let's just say I could get used to treating myself to a pedicure at the Mirror Mirror Salon on a regular basis. I really loved the fact that this salon uses hygienic liners in the bowls where you soak your feet. It's so important, I can't stress this enough! I contracted flesh eating bacteria at a high end nail salon in NYC and I could have lost my toe or worse. After that, I refuse to go anywhere that doesn't use them and finding places that do can be difficult. If I were you, I'd consider going to Mirror Mirror for that fact alone... 

Now as for the high quality products I was mentioning, I'll give you a little play by play. They use a callus softener on your feet followed by a brown sugar souffl scrub. Then comes the glycolic acid mask and healing foot mousse. After that I received one of the best foot massages ever with a rich, moisturizing body butter followed by their yummylicious vanilla paraffin wax.

I made sure I thanked my friend profusely for the gift certificate. I'll definitely return and I recommend checking out this salon. If you do, make sure to say hello to Tami for me. She's great!

My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)

I'm just going to add my own two cents...
After reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!

If you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!

Superior dim sum all day and every day!!!! What a BIG surprise!

Who could ever expect this place to be in Las Vegas? Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!

I've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best true dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too. 

If you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!

Lately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!

The place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!

What to write for my 1600th review?

Sometimes, sage sayings can be contradictory. For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!

With certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal

However, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)

I made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked

The restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced

1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu
I usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster

2. Trio of hamachi
This delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations

3. Sashimi duo
My first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi

4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips
The beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips

5. Ezi Ebi
If I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case

6. Niku
Braised Kobe-style short rib was served with sauted foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual

7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms
No ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!

8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root

9. Dessert Tasting
Raspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal

As you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients

As for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!

Amazing.

Small and intimate, it's a delightful place.  A place to make new friends, be in a friendly and relaxed environment, and feel like something special.

Tip #1: You must make reservations.

Tip #2: Text the phone number.  Name, # in your party, and the date/time.  You will be texted a confirmation with instructions.

Tip #3: You enter thru the Commonwealth club.

Tip #4: Await further instructions, but the entry is not thru the locked freezer looking door.

Greeted by a beautiful and elegant girl, she was in a silver and black form-fitting dress.  She took my friend and I into a small room, explained what was going to happen, and then opened another door to let us in.

Wonderful ambiance.  A small bar that seats 6, chairs with a counter along the wall, and 4 tables with chairs.  Really intimate.  Chandeliers, wooden doors as a ceiling, and features the coolest bathroom ever.

Daniel came over and explained the little booklet of drinks, but that he would make anything we wanted.  Note: they don't have any beer or wine, but things with cocktails and spirits is the name of the game.  Flavored popcorn was great (and free!).

We sat at a table for awhile, and mosied over to the bar -- much better.  Made new friends, and got to know Daniel -- which was a treat.  A very likeable and talent guy.  Albeit he has limited space to work with.

At 10pm or so on Wednesdays, they have a piano player who is wonderful.

Truly fantastic.  It's a must.

I don't like to be a party popper but I am going to poop on this party so peoples know zis. My absolute least favorite venue in Phoenix is Marquee theater. Least favorite. 

From the moment you hear that a band you love is coming to Phoenix you get on your knees and pray that they're not playing marquee. *please be crescent. pleeeease be crescent.* and then you finish reading the email from stateside and the weeping commences. 

First comes the butt ripping for the tickets. Did I say ripping? I meant raping. They are not available at Zia or Stinkweeds. So then you have to buy them online. So then you have to pay the outrageous service fees they tack on. So then you have to take precious time out of your schedule to go down there to get the tickets before the night of the show. Or else you have to wait in an atrocious line to get your tickets before your show starts. All things stated, it ain't fun. 

Then you get to there the night of the show and be prepared to be all kinds of uncomfortable, kids. If you haven't picked up your tickets previously you have to stand in line and do that first. You will then have to form two separate lines, male and female. Then have your things rifled through. And finally have a full on pat down! And that's before you even get your ID checked. But on the bright side it's been a while since I've had to take off my shoes in the line during this process. (I'll add a star for that!) 

Once inside you'll pay way too much for a beverage. Then you'll see that marquee has kind of a cool unique standing room only layout, with the floor sloping toward the stage. The floors have recently been "redone"; which I take to mean painted. And the bathrooms can be tolerated with only minimal disgust, depending on the show.

And while it's not the intimate venue I was  hoping for, I will try not to let my party pooping all over this place discourage you. The sound isn't terrible everywhere and the other show goers are going to be mildly obnoxious no matter where you go. So rock, roll, and bounce on, Phoenix. Looks like marquee ain't going nowhere.

So Dallas G and I were thinking of a lunch spot.  I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a "better" idea and suggested Athenian Express.

As we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090

In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.

We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.

Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.

As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of "gyro meat" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.

I move on to my side of potato salad.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283

Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.

Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.

I'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.  But not as big of a joke as Athenian Express, which must have suffered a precipitous decline in quality if even Dallas G (and his notoriously low standards) ever liked it.

You know how it is when you live in Vegas -- everyone comes to visit, and expects you to take them someplace "cool." Pressure!

Yesterday I had two different friends in town, who both wanted a piece of me. One is a 7-months-pregnant Conservative Christian from Arkansas, and the other is a traveling art-nude model with a wild '70s bush and a predilection for men 40+ years her senior. Where to take them that would appeal to both??

I wanted someplace fun, unpretentious and off-Strip (both of my friends have the good sense to despise the overpriced pretentiousness of places with all-caps names like MIX, STACK, FIX, DOUCHE...oh wait, the Health Dept. shut that one down). 

Anyhoo, I asked around and finally lit on Bar + Bistro...which turned out to be AWESOME! This was in the middle of the humid monsoon season (8.1.11), but we sat on their fabulous patio anyway -- and it was GREAT! They have a huge patio all strung up with Christmas lights, facing out onto Charleston Blvd...but it's not loud at all, and very pleasant. 

I always go for atmo over food quality...but it wasn't just the atmo that was kickass here -- every single thing we ordered was FANTASTIC! I had the chopped Latin salad (delish and filling), my girlfriends had paella (bomb) and pizza mergherita (ditto), plus we split an order of mahi mahi tacos (fabulous) and the lavash/hummus they brought us was also incredible. I really can't speak highly enough of the food here...and the prices were totally reasonable.

The waitstaff was super badass, too. One of the waiters, a super cool guy named Arash, even came and had a beer with us. We had a total blast, and this was on a Monday night when the place was totally dead! I can only imagine how much fun it is during First Friday or their Saturday night poetry jam. 

I will DEFINITELY be coming back here!

P.S. They also have a fairly extensive tapas menu...and I recommend this place a thousand times over Firefly. MUCH better atmo.

Malt. Not the liquor, the vinegar. If a place has malt vinegar for their fries, I'm sold. Ok, in places with malt vinegar, they're called "chips," not fries. Anyway...
Group of 6 of us showed up to have a lunch meeting. They had no issues with us pulling an extra table in to accommodate us. (By the way, I had no idea there were two Ms in that word!).
Service was super-quick. Our server was right on us & took our drink orders. 
I had the fish n chips, which is what I always get. I'm a freak for it! The fish had a really crispy batter that wasn't heavy. It was cooked all the way through. It makes me barfy if I get fish with batter that's so thick there's still raw batter. Sick!
FRESH fries. I mean chips. They still had the skin on them, which is my very favorite. 
She even brought us a bowl of lemon wedges for our fish.
We didn't even have to ask for our checks, either. Well, maybe she just wanted to get rid of us, but we were only there for a little over an hour. Or, we were so obnoxious she wanted to get us out of there. I doubt it, as she seemed to be able to tolerate The Rowdies.
With a tip, I paid $11 for my lunch. That's a great value and I was stuffed. Not food coma stuffed, but nicely stuffed. Not like Thanksgiving, but like...a business lunch.
They even have OTB there. I don't bet on the horsies, though.

P.S. This used to be called Hail Mary's.

Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside. 

As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.

Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  

We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace. 

We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.

The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brle.

The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.

Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.

Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal. 

I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.

Happy Eats!

I've had this place bookmarked for a long time &  finally got a chance to try it out!!

As with all AYCE, not everything will be the best quality, but you get good quality fish for a reasonable price.

Some of our faves of the night were:
yellowtail - very fresh & creamy
lychee sorbet - THE best sorbet, mmmmm
strawberry mochi - I love mochi
unagi - good texture, not slimy
pork belly - great grill flavor but kinda fatty
salmon
scallop
poke salad
cucumber salad
gyozas

Some of our not so faves of the night were:
uni - not freshest
sweet shrimp was ok 
tuna - not fresh

The location is nice but pretty far from the strip, about 10 minutes drive.  The ambiance is really cute.  Loved the decor and bar area.  It is smaller than I would have expected, about 15 tables and a bar.

The service is top notch as we were never rushed.  Even when we spent about 2.5 hours, they still made sure we got everything we wanted.  I ordered extra dessert a couple of times (hehe).

Definitely recommended for being piggies in the desert!!  What's Vegas without all the munching!!  Don't forget to get a stampcard, buy 10 get 1 free!

Have you ever looked at the every day girl that rings your order up at Starbucks, or the semi-cute chick at the bank and wonder what they would look like topless and shaking their money makers on a stage? Is it just me that has that kind of imagination? Anybody? Well, if you have wondered about that, go to Bandaids to find out. 
I had the opportunity to visit Bandaids and I don't regret that I did. We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar. Some of the guys are a bit pervy of course...offering to buy drinks or lap dances for you in the slight hope that you might be interested in giving them a private dance. No winners that night! Besides, I was there for some boobage! 
The women of Bandaids aren't perfect, they don't have fake boobs, they don't have perfect bodies. They are every day women that happen to strip for the dough. I wasn't left panting over any hotties unfortunately, but I was impressed at the bravery of some of the women that got up on the stage and worked it. I felt A LOT better about my body after going to Bandaids and seeing some of the girls there. 
Will I go to Bandaids again? Yep! It's a chill place and the girls aren't pushy and I didn't feel at all uncomfortable. It would be nice if they improved the bathrooms for the girls, but that's a small detail. Just hover and you'll be fine! I guess you could say I'm a fan of the dive bar and we were treated very well there. Is it a fancy Scottsdale strip club? Nope. It's your friendly neighborhood strip club to grab a beer, see some boobage, and move along.

i'm giving turf 4 stars for now, i expect 5 stars will be on a follow up.

first time here and i have to say i already love the place, its within a 7 minute walk from my apartment and that is something i have been dreaming of since i first signed a lease. my only full bar options are Portlands (meh) and carley's (good god no!!) and the bikini (way too far to stumble home, and HIPSTER) and sidebar (close, but not really stumble home close). so here i am meeting my roomie for drinks after work, i walk in and wow. i expected allot worse from the reviews from John V and Pierre. 

let me correct the misconceptions, its not in any way empty space, yes it's not overly crowded (yet) but i had a mental picture of the brickhouse empty. it is nothing like that. the floor plan is laid out with seating for sit down comfort..split with a bar and tall bar sit up tables. i was also expecting barren walls. but from what i can tell there wasn't a barren wall in the building.

as far as pierre, i havn't trusted a review of his since i read his review of Sing High (god awful) so his interpretation of a dive bar is completely off. after reading his review i expected to walk into an updated classy newsroom..but was surprised to find a complete opposite. just a nice bar with a really friendly staff.

the seating at the bar is attractive green tweed swivel stools. (tweed..what is more irish then that?) adjacent to the bar is a comfortable seating area with leather arm chairs and high back booths. the prices are far below what i expected. 8 bucks for a sandwich and fries. completely acceptable. this is certainly going to be my go to bar. i expect many years of being trashed and being sweeped out the front door at 2am. 

turf thank you for opening, and thank you for the quaint patio for the smokers of the downtown area. much appreciated.

after i get my shit together, expect me here weekly, in fact i'll forward my calls to this place like Norm on cheers.



5 star review surely in the future. bless you.

oh and since i know you will read this, it was nice to meet you Melissa.

come on downtown yelpers, this WILL be the bar you are at on a regular.

I like to bring red heads here. I don't know why it works out this way it just does. I think red heads really suit The Parlor. Alright, alright, alright.

The actual restaurant is pretty awesome. Brick and wood and overall hipness. Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend (I have done both I know.)

The food is super good. I have been a Harley's fan for awhile but have to admit this place picks up the red sauce slack. The food has always been fresh with the right amount of parsley for that fresh taste. The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list. They make the pasta themselves and it is delicious. Even the sea food pasta (I don't speak Italian but whatever it was called) was awesome and we are in a land-locked state. The salads are pretty amazing as well.

*****LISTEN UP OWNERS*****
I am actually giving The Parlor 5-stars but holding one hostage. Why would you take the mushroom risotto out for a sweet corn one?! I haven't tried the corn yet and I am sure it is super fantastic but Virgin Mary mother of god , the mushroom one was soooo good. If you ever want to see your beloved 5th star from me you will bring it back. This is no joke. If I do not hear back in 5 days I will begin mailing you pieces of the star, but it will not end up on this review. Do it! Do it now!

It's been a couple of years since I last reviewed this place. Thankfully, Asian Island is still standing tall and cooking up delicious and fresh food at a great value. The chefs are very talented as they wok and roll cooking up their culinary masterpieces.

They have free delivery which I have used on occasion, especially when the Blackhawks were making their most recent Stanley Cup run. No way was I tearing myself away from the game. But I usually drop by to eat at the restaurant. The families that run this place are really friendly and care if you have a satisfying meal. If you want more bell peppers and less onions, no problem. So don't be afraid to speak up for substitutions or if you're not digging your entree. And of course, they are appreciative of positive feedback as well. As a side note, one Yelper mentioned that there was a lack of protein in his Mongolian Beef, I find that hard to believe.

 I actually ask for less meat for my signature dish of  Mongolian Beef and get a bunch of broccoli added.  All dishes are served with ample amount of food. Some other favorites include the Orange Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, Chicken Lo Mein, Shrimp Lo Mein and Happy Family. I'm not a Sushi eater so I can't attest to that part of the menu. But I have seen a lot of Sushi orders in the dining room. These guys don't have the name recognition of a couple of other Asian restaurants in the general area, but they are truly the tastiest option. Believe me, I have tried them all.

With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

Happy Eats!

Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. 

1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was "that's how its served here" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. 
When I asked her why the Merlot she said "Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.

2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.

3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.

All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

Oh yea Wo Fat is GOOOD. Whoever first told me about them in my pre-yelp days never told me they were this good but thanks Nik O. for jogging my faint memory of them and finally giving them a shot.

Don't be scared of places like Wo Fat, which give you the rundown feel, I use to but not anymore. How else would we know about Oyster Sauce Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wo-fat-las-vegas-2?select=JRUMn0K6eBpl6qbBv9HRPA#ZbfI5E_SlKq0fi3d5fkdNA Don't remember to get them with Cake Noodles, I did, but still very delicious without.  The portion was plentiful. One scoop of rice and lots of Oyster Sauce Chicken, my kind of rice to non-rice food ratio.

Service wise they'll bring out some complimentary tea and fell you're drink etc. It was OK nothing bad. Price wise they have some cheap lunch specials starting at $5.50. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wo-fat-las-vegas-2?select=JRUMn0K6eBpl6qbBv9HRPA#QtJ6ERMWPNyegVzjqH23gg All of the items are pretty reasonable priced. Interior is cluttered and kind of matches the exterior but does have booths and round tables to seat a good number of people and it did get a good number of people there the 2 times there.

I'll make it to this East Vegas location just for more Oyster Sauce Chicken. I want to also go back and try this Stuff Duck that I saw in the pics.

I HAVE URGES... 

"There is a human urge to clarify, rationalize, justify", said Leonard Bernstein. 

That sounds like a good description of Yelp, doesn't it, but that's not the urge I have. 

This definition is a better fit: 

a. An impulse that prompts action or effort. 
b. An involuntary tendency to perform a given activity. 

I have an urge to go to Las Vegas pronto. 

Do I like to gamble? Yes, sometimes. 

Do I like seeing some great shows? Definitely. 

Do I like going to the International CES, the world's largest consumer technology trade show? Oh, yeah, so much fun. 

Do I like staying in some great sexy hotel room on the Strip? You better believe it. 

But none of these are the reason for my urge. My urge is to go to a little nondescript shack located in a questionable, seedy area away from the Strip. The only strip this place is close to is the Olympic Gardens Strip Club that offers male and female strippers, and where lap dances go for 20 bucks. 

I need to go to Vegas because I want me some ice cream from Luv-It Frozen Custard NOW! 

Frozen custard is French style ice cream. It's lower in butterfat and calories than ice cream, and is made with eggs, which gives this indulgent concoction a creamier texture. It also has much less air whipped into it, and there are two types of air I don't like: people full of hot air (no, I'm not telling now) and ice cream full of air. 

I don't even like Sundaes, but at Luv-It Frozen Custard I am simply hypnotized by everything they have. Western Sundae, their most popular - vanilla custard, caramel, salty pecans and hot fudge? Give it to me now, before I get arrested for yanking it from the hands of some unsuspecting Japanese tourist! Bumble Berry Sundae? What's in it? Wait, I don't care, just pile it on! 

Everything is homemade, frozen custard flavors change every few days, so check their website, if you want to know what specific olfactory and oral pleasures to look forward to. Even their website looks hokily homemade, which in this case is just charming and consistent. 

So, if you want some frozen nirvana, if you're tired of seeing same old, same old corporate clones that look identical in LA, Johannesburg, Vegas and Moscow - this is the place for some instant bliss. 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...   I wish Luv-It frozen Custard didn't.

Sin City Burger, I've missed you.  Just a little over 2 years ago, the Smashburger was a wee tot and had just opened up.  I had the pleasure of dining here twice before I moved back to LA.  So, while visiting Vegas last week, I relished the chance to go back, eat, and have an opportunity to look at it anew with Yelper eyes.

Lots of tasty choices from burgers ($5-7, offered in 2 sizes), to salads ($6), to grilled chicken sandwiches ($6-7), hot dogs ($5), sides ($2-3), haagen-dazs shakes ($4), and chili ($3).  The prices are really reasonable, and if you don't fancy any of the selections, you can create-your-own anything here.

Re-living a not too recent favorite, I chose the Sin City Burger (american cheese, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and served on an egg bun, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aXY6Ejxdb1RpLzp5Q4COVQ&userid=ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A).  Instead of glorious fries, I chose the veggie frites (flash fried carrots and green beans).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#ejIvLEaxT5wsCd_UvtQRSQ
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#afd8gM9iwR4AZ1mcdECpyg

I think for the price-point of a $7 burger (1/2 pounder), it's very good and very messy...couldn't eat the whole burger without it breaking into pieces.  Taste wise, it's in the neighborhood of a In-and-Out, Johnny Rockets, or a Fatburger.  The meat is hand-formed, but thin and larger than the bun.  Seasoned lightly (I remembered it differently from before), but the quality of the meat is less than a gourmet burger (many which are found in my "Berger knows Burgers" list, http://www.yelp.com/list/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2).

The Veggie Frites, great choice to save on carbs, and a unique offering at a burger place.  Green beans and carrots, flash-fried, sounds great. Unfortunately, I found them really boring, really oily, and with no pizazz or seasoning.  I ended up adding a ton of salt to it, so sure, no carbs, but now -- not even healthy.  And, WTH -- are you flipping me off?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#P-k5gqRqkCBad8G2rw9WRw

In summary, while the price-point for individual items seems reasonable, they didn't offer a combo price, so my tab (with a soda) ran over $12.  Not an inexpensive burger lunch adventure by any means.  Would I go back again, absolutely.  The food is fresh, the decor is contemporary in red and white (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ) with big painted words of "Smash", "Sizzle", and "Savor" --- and if you know me at all -- I love a good burger fix, and I'll find one in any city across the country.

Can you say "food coma?"

OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!

We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!

We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the "Nay Nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...

So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  

I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!

400th Review!!!!!!!!

I have been dying to try J & G Steakhouse for a very long time, and when I saw there was a group of Yelpers going to try them out during the fall restaurant week I knew this was my chance!  

1st off, let's talk about the amazing view, you can see for miles, I honestly didn't want to leave, just wanted to watch the city lights twinkle and soak up the view!

For restaurant week, J&G offered a few choices, for me, I went to a steakhouse, so gosh darnit I'm having me some steak!! haha

I started with an arugula & boston lettuce salad with a mustard vinaigrette, now if you don't care of the bitter taste of the arugula, then this salad is not for you, but for me, everything blended perfectly.   I ordered the prime top sirloin cap which also came with a broccoli pure and some roasted garlic & chili flakes on the side, now the broccoli pure on its own tasted very wheat grassy green, if that makes since but the waiter told us to spinkle the garlic chili flakes over the steak and mix the steak with the pure, and OMG AMAZING!!!! The flavors all complement each other! Next thing I knew my steak was gone!! So good!!!   Ended my meal with caramel ice cream and a warm chocolate molten cake, omg so good!!! Love the combination of caramel and chocolate, had I not been at the J&G I'm pretty sure I would have licked my plate clean (not really, but yes it's that good).

Enjoyed my evening at J&G and with the company I was with, amazing views, great service, and excellent food! Hope to be back soon!

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

I have issues. Why else would I be this excited about the arrival of The Blind Pig to Scottsdale? It's a butcher for goodness sake! Yet, I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop planning my next visit. It's just that cool and the meat is just that good! 

First off, Scottsdale has desperately needed a local butcher shop for quite some time. In the past, I easily put 20+ miles on my car to drive to other butchers around the Valley and every time I did, I wondered when Scottsdale would get one. Now they have one! The Blind Pig is owned by the family who owns Uncle Sal's and the Side Door. The Blind Pig is their newest addition and it's a great one! The meat is fresh, preservative-free and delicious. They have everything from sausages and deli meat, to prime meat cuts and boneless pork chops. It's a meat-lover's paradise. If you're not sold yet, read this: it's also a full-service restaurant and a full-service bar which means that you can stop in for lunch or dinner, grab a cocktail and take some meat home on your way out. They also offer to-go beer and wine so you can grab a beverage or two for home! 

The environment is very homey and Fido's are welcome! They have a spacious patio and welcome any dogs. I also learned that they sell fresh meat for dogs! This is a one-stop-shop for all products pertaining to meat and I also enjoyed their marinades. I purchase a boneless pork chop, burger meat and a sausage... all for under $11. The prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of meat. I also purchase the bacon infused marinade which was incredible! I marinaded the boneless pork chop in it and died and went to bacon-heaven with every bite. 

In summary, this place is a must-visit for meat-lovers.

Always Time For a Coffee Stop!

SITREP

I was in a rush.  Not a RUSH rush.  But a RuSH to get situated at my gate since boarding was to start happening in 10 minutes.  

THE SETUP

I like to give myself some buffer time when standing in line at an eatery/coffee shop because you never know really how long they will take to get your order done - I certainly didn't need a repeat of my Nathan's burger situation at McCarran airport in Las Vegas where my "5 minutes" (as clearly annunciated by them in the King's English) turned into 25 mins w/ a large side of attitude from the 2 staff there.

In addition, when given the chance, I like to try a different coffee branding (other than my go-to "Starbucks") that I may not have tried before, and that also looks inviting.

SPEEDY

Luckily, Cartel was smooth sailing with getting my large mocha-to-go for my Southwest flight back to Sacramento.  AND they did my Mocha as a sugar-free option, which I appreciate.

ON PRINCIPLE

However, whether here, or Starbucks, or Peets, or a fast food place, etc., I get really torqued for any shop that charges nearly $5 for a mocha that I should - and do - get for between $3-$4 at a non-airport location. 

Please note:  just because you (inset business name) are at an airport location 
doesn't justify nor support the business metrics for overcharging customers.  

This is along the GOUGING you see at the Coachella Music Festival charging $6 for a tiny bottle of water or a Movie Theater charging $6 for a medium soda.  Somehow the notion came along that "Trapped Audience = Demographic to Abuse".  I'll never accept that.

therefore, this is a minus one-star whomever the over-charging business is, just to be clear.

THE LOWDOWN

A great coffee stop in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport!

The place.
Cant talk about Wandering Horse Buffet, with out mentioning Talking stick casino, its the tall building east of the 101 in Scottsdale. Im glad the people decided to ditch the tents and build a nice building with a golf course around it, and by the way the rooms are really nice with out a big price, if your a local check out  their deals during slow seasons.  Yeah and its hidden as well in the maze of slot machines and black jack tables. 
Well for the buffet, no problems here close as you can get to a fancy Casino Buffet in Vegas.  The menu is always changing so keep up to date great specials.  Another tip, the Wandering Horse Buffet also hosts great food for holidays.  As for the service staff, I leave a nice ti. Im being real when I say, I don't tip at all buffets.  
For the atmosphere Clean classy casino buffet.  you don't eat in a smoke haze. the seats are nice and comfy if i remember right they have wheels, don't tell me that not fun.  

Personally any place that can satisfy a dessert feast after a large meal wins me as a fan.  

Anyways casino prices,
    * Buffet Breakfast - $9.95
    * Buffet Lunch - $13.95 
    * Buffet Dinner Sunday thru Thursday - $20.95 
    * Buffet Dinner Friday & Saturday $26.95 
    * Sunday Buffet Brunch - $27.95 
    * Holiday Buffets - $42.95 
kid prices as well.

What is a "Coney Dog?", you ask.  "Definitely not a chili dog" is what has been told to me.  A real Michigan Coney Dog has an all-beef casing hot dog grilled to perfection and placed in a steamed bun.  This hot dog is topped with, and this is where it gets the distinction from a chili dog, an all meat chili, onions and mustard.  

Since I LOVE to try the most I can in one order... I ordered a "Combo Coney Dog".  This is the Coney dog I described above (I got my onions grilled) with "Loose" meat on top of the hot dog.  What's "loose meat"?  Well, that's just grilled ground beef crumbled up...  They put the loose meat on top of the hot dog and then put the all meat chili on top of that.  Just dang delicious.  I really liked the taste of the hot dog itself. 

Not to be out done by the hot dog, the fries here are fantastic.  I litterally watched the chef cut the potato and put the curly fries in the fryer.  The fries are just that fresh.  Oh, by the way, they grind their own meat daily for their hamburgers.

I stopped in Coney Grill to have a Faygo pop and to try the hot dog.  I grew up drinking Faygo pops when I was a kid.  Grape being my favorite flavor.  Detroit Coney Grill has Faygo pops in the bottle.  There is something about the taste of a soda out of a bottle that makes it taste 1000 times better.  I savored every cold, sweet sip.

I like this place.  I'm going back.  I'm taking some of my ex-Detroit family when they come in town.

Yummy.  This place is great!  Get there early, they close a little bit early.

"Whoa, what?!  Pinball Hall of Fame?  Are you serious?!" I thought when I saw the listing. "This can't be real."  But it was, it was!  

As a very serious adult type person, I decided to tell one of the coolest kids in my life about this.  After watching about 3 videos of the place, he was absolutely jumping up and down.  This may be an 11 year old's biggest dream come true, and there is no entry fee, no catches or gimmicks, just a whole lotta pinball machines, game machines, candy machines, even a moustache machine for some reason!  

Every day I saw him from the day I showed him the videos on, he asked, "Can we go to the Pinball Hall of Fame TODAY?  I have $20 in quarters!!!"  Tonight, I finally gave in and we made the trek down Tropicana to this nondescript, illustrious wonder of a place.  Upon entry through the door, the place was truly a wonder to behold.  Four double-sided rows (or more!) of pinball games, a solid row of old school arcade games (the original Punch Out, Tetris, and Super Mario Bros - even Joust!), multiple quarter candy machines (Reece's Pieces, cashews, gumballs), and even the claw games you can never really win (but you sure do try!)

We played Indiana Jones pinball, The Simpsons pinball, Super Mario Bros pinball, Ripley's Believe It or Not pinball, Flintstones pinball, Stargate pinball, and on and on until we had spent about $30 or so.  Lots of the machines had 5 balls instead of just three and extra game deals if you purchased more than one game.  It was fun remembering that if you matched the numbers at the end of the game, you actually won another free game!  We loved the games with multiball and really dug the games that gave you your ball back when you lost it too quickly (happens a lot during pinball, but you usually lose the ball!) 

He found an old school basketball game that was kind of mechanical and cool and a neat shoot 'em up game where you hit moving targets.  We played the last one together for a while and he loved the fact that there were actually moving parts instead of just an electronic screen!  (Ahh, back in the day, right?)  

By some magic, we made it out with quarters left, big smiles and ran right into a boatload of traffic on the Strip - but, it was entirely worth it.  Highly recommended entertainment and a real blast from the past - especially for us 80's kids turned "very serious adult type people" who remember the good old days when whatever was wrong in your life, a roll full of quarters and a good arcade could make it all better.

I was intrigued by a few mentions of GoodyTwos in a recent talk thread about the best peanut butter in town, but I didn't seek it out.  Instead, I let it find me, and in time, it did... in the form of a beautifully wrapped gift box!  

It was a gift for Jared and I and on the customized ribbon was a Yelp burst and the text "Congrats to an Elite Couple!" How cute is that?  I was sold at the packaging alone, and my strong willpower kept me away from what was inside for a while.  Jared tried the tasty toffee the day we received it and I could tell it had his approval right away.  I told him to store it in our freezer so it would be around when my craving struck.  And guess what?  My craving struck tonight!

I have to agree with what Kirin wrote in her review... this toffee is like crack!  I took one bite and couldn't stop!  It is rich, creamy, delicious, and oh so addicting!  I proceeded to eat several pieces of the "Crme de la Crunch" flavor (Fresh pecans & almonds, coffee liqueur & white chocolate), and then I moved on to the "Double Crossed" flavor (Almonds, vanilla milk & dark chocolate, all criss-crossed with white chocolate).  But I couldn't stop there... I broke into the bag of the "Traditional" flavor too!

So there you have it... the reason why I cannot start eating desserts and sweets.  Because when I do, I have no control!  I can't stop!  But even so, I have to give into my craving every now and then.  And if I'm going to splurge, there isn't much out there that is better to splurge on than GoodyTwos Toffee!

If you're a toffee lover or just looking for a unique gift for someone for any occasion, go check this place out!  Although I haven't been into the store itself, I can vouch for the gift wrap and the product... I am sure that the recipient of any type of GoodyTwos Toffee will be pleased.

This local BBQ icon was on our list of dining destinations when Santi and I were planning our trip to Madison. Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area. Adding to the dcor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   

We shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.

The Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. 

The BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ. They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table.

Service was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices. I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit. However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal. Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Beef Briskets and Chicken Dinner.

I'm paraphrasing here, but this is how the typical customer service call went in almost all my experiences.

Cox - Hi, how can I help you.

Me - I am having trouble connecting to the internet at the moment. I've just finished resetting my computer, my router, and my modem. I checked all of my network cables, I'm able to communicate with other computers that are behind my router, and I just can't get to the internet. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood at the moment?

Cox - Sorry to hear that. Can you please try unplugging your cable modem, waiting 15 seconds, and plugging it back in?

Me - Uh, yes, like i said, I just did that like a minute ago.

Cox - Oh, can you just try again for me anyway?

Me - I'm pretty sure there's a problem with the internet, can you just confirm if there are any reports in my neighborhood at the moment.

Cox - Are you sure it's not your wifi? Can you try plugging your computer directly into the modem?

Me - (getting upset at this point) Sure, I'll plug my laptop into the modem. ... still not working. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood? I'd just like to know if there's an outage that is getting worked on or not.

Cox - I'm showing that everything is online and no outage. I think maybe you should try resetting your modem again.

Me - Really, do you have to ask me all these questions before you can answer if there is a reported outage in my neighborhood or not? 

Cox - Yes, we need to go through the troubleshooting steps first.

Me - FINE - I'll reset the dang modem again, for the third time.
Yep, still broke.

Cox - I think there is a problem with your cable lines, have you ever had trouble with mice? I know that sometimes animals can chew through the lines. If you'd like I can send a line repairman out to your house, but there will be a $100+ minimum charge to fix the cable lines in your house.

Me - are you serious?

Cox - Yes, I have seen this before.

Me - no, ARE.. YOU.. SERIOUS?
Do you have a supervisor I can talk with?

Cox - My supervisor is busy at the moment, and they will tell you the exact same thing I am. I have the same information they do.

Me - I really don't care, is your supervisor's supervisor available?

Cox - I'm sorry, why don't you try resetting your modem again.

Me - GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR NOW, please. I no longer wish to speak with you.

Cox Supervisor - Yes, I'm showing there is a reported outage in your neighborhood and the service truck is actually working on it now. If you look down the street at the X and X intersection you should see them doing scheduled work right now.

Me - ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! YOU'RE DOING SCHEDULED LINE WORK ON THE CONNECTION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT 7PM ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING? THIS IS REDICULOUS, AND WHY COULDN'T YOUR OPERATOR JUST TELL ME THIS WHEN I CALLED 45 MINUTES AGO?

Cox Supervisor - I am sorry sir, there is no reason to get upset at me the way you are.

Me - PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR CAUSE YOUR BEING BELIGERANT WITH ME RIGHT NOW.


Cox, this is the reason I dislike calling you, no this wasn't a one time, unique experience, I've had very similar conversations over multiple calls. I'm so glad the relationship we had has finally moved on, and I'm not looking back!

I'm not a gambler a drinker, so LV is not really my kind of town, unless I'm off the strip. The Rio is just that, a little of the strip and closer to where the locals go. 

Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a larger suite, SWEET!!!. The room was very nice, looked clean, didn't smell of yesterdays smoke, alcohol, or any flow play. The bed was a nice comfy size, king. Not sure why the t.v. is placed on the side wall, kind of difficult to watch in bed even have to do the head crank when seated on the couch, opposite the bed. 

The bathroom was fairly clean. I don't understand why hotels especially of such caliber don't wash their shower curtains. Upon inspection, I opened the curtain an almost hurled because of the sour smell the curtain spewed. It was nice to see that they automatically provided those little things you tend to forget, such as toothbrush, toothpaste and shower stuff. The vanity area is a bit odd, nice that there is a single cup coffee maker, but why put it on a shelf and one has to pull out and place on the vanity counter. Couldn't they just raise the shelf above to give the coffee maker enough room to open for water and the coffee packs? I was tempted. 

The casino itself is like any other, noisy and people everywhere. The downside is the HVAC. It must be the original unit since every time I walked out of the casino, I smelled of stale cigarettes. Yeah, I didn't spend much time there. I did, however, spend enough time to try their Pho restaurant. I will be writing a review for this place, so I won't say much here except, that was Pho? Blah. 

The room was nice and the price was good, should I go back to LV, I may consider staying here again.

"Red meat is not bad for you. Now, blue-green meat--that's bad for you!"  Tom Smothers

Two days of Thanksgiving leftovers is about all I can take before I want something different.  Those who know me know I love my seafood.  While The Ahi Tuna Burger would usually be right up my alley, I decided that after so much turkey in my belly, I wanted a greasy cheesy burger and thus, I ordered the Cheesy Burger from Burger 21!  

I've been wanting to give this place a try.  With a location in Scottsdale, I never had an opportunity to stop by since I'm rarely in the area.  When I saw they were setting up right next to a delicious pizza place a couple doors down, I waited patiently to get my hands on a burger.  Today was the day I got to sink my teeth into one of these bad boys!  The Cheesy Burger is described as, "Lettuce, tomato, American, cheddar, or Swiss [what I ended up choosing] cheese, toasted brioche bun."  It was all that and more.  Juicy flavorful meat for $6.50!  I got a side of sweet potato fries with my burger since I wanted to take advantage of their condiments station.  The mister got the Tex-Mex Haystack with sweet potato fries and a bananas foster milkshake.  Everything was so tasty!  Even that grease that oozes out of the burger with every bite was good.  Burger 21 does their burgers justice.  It's either that or my taste-buds were just happy from protein that didn't come in gobble-til-ya-wobble form.  Nonetheless, I like how they make their milkshakes.  Yummy!

Would I come here again?  Definitely.  I need to try that Ahi Tuna Burger, Spicy Thai Shrimp Burger, and some cheese & ale fries!

Note:  Sweet potato fries and toasted marshmallow sauce is a definite winner.  The chipotle mayo sauce is also friggin amazing.  Woo!

I currently have a membership at another gym in town, but wanted to find something closer to my new home. My fiancee and I stopped in to LVAC and met with Drew. He toured us around the facility, which seemed pretty nice. Very spacious and lots of equipment to choose from. We went in at 2:30 on a Thursday and there were plenty of machines (cardio and strength training) available. You're probably wondering why I only gave this location one star, right? 

THE SALES PITCH!!! I told Drew that I was hesitant about signing a 26 month (yes, you read that right... 26 month) contract. He proceed to call me lazy, saying that I didn't want to commit to working out for 26 months. I told him that motivation wasn't the problem-- that I already had a gym membership (without a contract) was simply looking for something closer to my house so I could make my trips to the gym more convenient. He did not want to tell me how much I would have to pay to cancel my membership if I was unhappy. He then said, "I see you're holding a cell phone. Bet you had to sign a contract for that, huh?" I told him that I didn't-- that I was on a family plan that was not in my name so I could cancel at any time. Then he proceeded to ask how much I paid each month for my cell phone bill. Are you serious?! Worst. Salesman. Ever. 

After I told him that I was uncomfortable answering that question, he excused himself to get his manager. The manager (I can't remember his name) was very polite and explained other options that did not include a 26 month contract. However, at that point, I had already mentally checked out. My fiancee may still end up joining LVAC, but I will keep my membership at my current gym and drive an extra 10 minutes. The extra time in the car is definitely worth the difference in service and attitude.

XS is a gorgeous club, no doubt. Plus, it's huge and you can go outside when it's getting cramped inside. However, like most clubs in Vegas, the cover is expensive ($30 for guys, $20 for girls and Encore guests - there's no guestlist), the drinks are nearly $20 a pop, and terrible, terrible DJ. I personally cannot stand mash-ups of terrible hip hop songs, but I guess the majority of club-goers are down with that and/or have short attention spans. They seriously need to get some good celebrity DJs in there -- they make enough money to have one every night.

The doormen and staff are actually really nice, and luckily we got to bypass the insane line. It looked like the line was rather quick though, and they started letting people inside on Friday at around 9:30pm.

The huge pool area is a nice place to lounge, and you can get bottle service out in the cabanas as well. The bartenders work fast, so getting drinks from the bars isn't a problem. 

There are a lot of beautiful people (ow! 8/14 gallery, page 6 http://www.xslasvegas.com/flash/index.php), and the go-go dancers are pretty hot... so yes, there are a lot of things that make XS way better than all of the other big clubs I've been to in Vegas. It definitely feels glamorous, not trashy. Expect to spend around $100 per person. But then again, money ain't a thing when you're in Sin City!

Two words for this show and overall venue: ENTERTAININGLY WEIRD!

Saw this 10 pm show on a Thursday night with 3 other Yelp friends of mine. Might as well have been 3 in the morning on a Sunday night because what I witnessed was bizarre and a bit abstract. 

When you enter this venue, it is literally a whole other dimension, like you were high on some kind of drug. The way the place is set up makes you think the interior designer did not know what they were doing, but once you get settled and have a better feel only than you will understand why this place was designed this way.

As we were ushered to our seats, the first thing I noticed was that show area itself was a bit intimate, like the stage was purposely built for all of us like we were close friends or something. It's not your typical stage show area for we were surrounded by a bar/lounge/restaurant type atmosphere all rolled into one.

Now, as for the show itself, bravo! What you get is pretty much nonstop action of different performers doing things that you might have never witnessed anywhere else. With character names like Captain Frodo and Piff, the Magic Dragon, you get a variety of entertainment that I can only describe as "Unexpected" not to mention some nudity and what adult show could use a little bit of T and A?

I will definitely would not mind watching this again for I was told not every show is quite the same. More nudity perhaps? LOL. Anyways, for those that are thinking of watching this show, you will definitely get your money's worth! Enjoy!

"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster." - Henry Hill in Goodfellas (and secretly most guys watching the movie)

The Mob Museum was better than expected (3.5 stars), but, at $20/person, not exactly an offer you can't refuse. Here's what Wise Guys know:

 * Open 10:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Fri/Sat)
 * Adult: $20; Child (10-17): $14; Under 10: Free; Seniors/Military: $16; 
 * Nevada Residents can save $6 ... so $14 and $10
 * $30 Tickets for 2 Museums available: Neon Museum plus Mob Museum
 * Parking Lot next to Mob Museum is $5 ... or use a downtown casino lot & walk
 * Located inside the historic (1933) Las Vegas Federal Courthouse & Post Office
 * The self-guided tour takes a couple hours and covers 3 floors
 * The Mob Museum shows how Prohibition led to the expansion of the Mafia
 * The real wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago is there
 * Exhibits cover legends Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel
 * Also Sam Giancana, Lefty Rosenthal, Mickey Cohen, John Gotti, & Whitey Bulger
 * The FBI & government get props for their battle against the mafia
 * Weapons, crime scene pics, and mob stories are everywhere
 * Lots of photographs of real mobsters and stories of their "real" families
 * The history of Las Vegas in the pictures/displays was very interesting to me
 * There's as much memorabilia of Las Vegas as there is for La Costa Nostra
 * Original casino/bar photos were fascinating; my how far Vegas has come
 * Liked displays on connections between mob families in different U.S. cities
 * One floor is dedicated to the actual Courtroom used for a Kefauver Hearing in 1950
 * Of course, Mob Movies are highlighted/celebrated, too.
 * No food/beverages, professional cameras, or large bags ... and no weapons
 * Small Mob Museum Gift Shop had some friendly people working there

At times, the Mob Museum feels like a romanticized Hall of Fame for organized criminals and law enforcement catching them. Because it is relatively modern, many of the displays keep your attention. It's not in the "must-visit" category for a Vegas vacation or weekend, but if you're tired of the casinos, clubs, shows, and action on the Las Vegas Strip then you may consider the Mob Musuem to "see what everyone's not talking about."

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stayed at The Cosmo for two nights. I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. 

The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. 

There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. 

The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano. 

*Tip: Milos offers food to go, so if you want to eat dinner in your car on your way back to LA get Milos to go rather than having to stop for fast food!

We got in around 7 pm into Las  Vegas, everyone was hungry. We didn't want to go to a buffet. We wanted something simple, since we had a bunch of kids with us. When we checked in at the resort, they gave us a menu for Rosati's Pizza. It even had some family value coupons and they deliver. Spaghetti, Pizza & Wings it is then. 

The coupon "Family Pasta Special" ($25.99) was for (1) Family Spaghetti or Mostaccioli, (4) Bread Sticks, (6) Meatballs & a 2 litter soda. We chose the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. When they say "family" they mean big, large as in a full tray of spaghetti. That was not what I expected. And it was very very good. The bread stick was garlicky, also good. The meatballs were delicious. (A must order) Matched well with the spaghetti. Highly recommend this deal. 

Like I said, I didn't expect the special to be so much food, so I ordered more. 

Hawaiian Luau Pizza, Canadian Bacon & Pineapple. This was just okay for me. The kids loved it though. 

Buffalo Wings (24 pcs) Delicious. Fried to perfection. The sauce was not too vinegary (the way I like it) I could not stop eating them. Yummy!!

Fettuccine Alfredo was also a hit. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy without being too rich. Delicious 

Service was good. From the lady taking the order to the gentlemen who delivered it. Even got a courtesy phone call to tell me he was parking (it's hard to find parking where I'm staying) I appreciated that 

It was a very good Family dinner. Everything tasted delicious and getting a lot of food was a pleasant surprise. 
I'll definitely be back.

First things first, I gotta give a shout out to my girl Jaime W. for telling me about Penn's Thai House! It's not our #1 pick for thai food in Vegas (nothing beats Komol for my hubby!!) but it's really close to our house and the Penn (the owner) is fabulous. 

The location isn't the best, but that can be said about some of the other fantastic thai places in town, like those in Commercial Center. This isn't a fine dining establishment by any means. Aesthetically, the place could use a little work.  But for people that like take out, Penn's is fab! 

Unlike some places in town, when you request your meal hot at Penn's, you are going to get it hot... regardless of your ethnic background. My husband likes his food HOT, to the extent that he will break out in a sweat halfway thru his meal if it was done right.. Not only has he always been happy with the heat factor on the food he has ordered from Penn's, but the owner goes above and beyond and will package up containers of the different spices and chilis so if he needs a little extra OOMPH, he can add it. She does this without us asking, just because she remembers his request for hot food from the very first time we went in.

I am not a big fan of spicy foods, in fact I'd go as far as to say I am a wussy when it comes to the heat. Penn's still keeps me happy with their delicious egg rolls, tasty stir fries and, mmm is there thai tea ever good! 

If you find yourself out in Henderson, craving some spicy thai grub, give Penn's a try.

Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago "Red Hot" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: "Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!"  You hear that Mike!

An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

Happy Eats!

I wonder what Don Arden and Fluff LeCoque would think of the new, relaunched Jubilee! After being closed for several weeks, it had its official relaunch at the end of March.  I saw the show last night, my 7th time seeing the show, and I am aghast at what has been done.

I never thought I would go to see Jubilee! and I have a man acting as a master of ceremonies for this section of the show ask, "How you doin', Vegas?  I said, How you doin' Vegas?  Get out of your seats and clap with me."  At this point, most of us stood and clapped while some singers did a number and then we all sat back down.

The show now is a mishmash.  It doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts out somewhat like the old Jubilee! with pretty showgirls parading in wonderful showgirl costumes.  After this, the train starts to jump the track.  We have music that tries to appeal to Boomers and near Millennials.  

Along the way, the curtain comes down and a showgirl is "lost" outside the curtain from her friends.  Thus begins Jubilee's attempt to return to the friends.  (Yep, the lost character is called Jubilee).  We see her later stage right as some sing about the lost Jubilee but then it ends.  We don't see her anymore as a lost person.  During part of her journey, she's guided by dancers carrying light sticks.  I think I had to push by jaw back in place when I saw that!

The classic Samson and Delilah and Titanic numbers remain in the show with some costume modifications and some scenery changes but they are about the same as they have been.  

One of the new parts that really was appealing was a tap dance number with just the showgirls' legs showing from the knees down. It was quite well done and lasted all of about 30 seconds.

The lighting has been changed so it often shines at the audience.  The show used to have two or three short segments between the big numbers where contract acts did specialty things.  The last time I was here, there was a person who did some work with silks.  This bit of diversion gave the dancers time to change and the tech crew time to get the scenery changes in place.  These specialty segments are now gone.

There are some good projections but seriously do you have to make it seem like  Caesars Entertainment is the only thing on the Strip.  I know Bally's is a CET property but come on, showing The Cromwell, the High Roller, Caesars Palace et. al. in some of the projection is amazing!  We know where we are.  We're on the Las Vegas Strip seeing what was a classic Las Vegas topless showgirl review that has been relaunched.  Keeping the Titanic in the show is quite correct.  The Jubilee! ship is sinking.  Time to play Nearer My God To Thee for Jubilee! 

Edit: I have to add that the final scene is as marvelous as ever.  A grand staircase with lovely showgirls coming down in their heels and wonderful costumes. The ending is classic!  

It saddens me to see what they've done to this show.  Judging by attendance last night, it's not working and that's a shame!

This is one of the best nightclubs I've seen in a very long time.  They did a great job with the design of the club, especially the light and sound.  We were there on 4/26 to see Deadmau5.  We reserved a booth on the 2nd floor overlooking the main room...it was amazing!  The laser/light show was perfectly suited for the music and done very well.  From our vantage point, it was exceptional.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=PbJCoYtRwa-BHFOatI8CnQ#PbJCoYtRwa-BHFOatI8CnQ
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=jRPS0hDzWjGVfmbPHsSPWA#jRPS0hDzWjGVfmbPHsSPWA

We setup the booth well in advance and it was easy for us to get in.  It's a mega-nightclub in Vegas, you have to expect to wait if you don't have things setup in advance....it cracks me up to read the reviews complaining about the lines, etc.

The bottles were reasonable....Magnum of Patron & Goose for $950.  Our VIP server was very accommodating and attentive, keeping our mixers full and replenishing our bottles when they emptied.  We had 16+ people in our booth, so the alcohol was being consumed pretty fast.  I have no idea what the final damage was for the evening....well over $5000.

Now for the music....Deadmau5 was simply amazing.  He came on around 1 am and tore it up.  There wasn't a bad spot in the club....the club is engineered well and the bass/highs/mids were perfect throughout.  I didn't want the night to end, it was that good.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=xfz96V7lzRzWXE4wzk9Tqg#xfz96V7lzRzWXE4wzk9Tqg
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=GPf9-lJThUsatjt38jNOFA#GPf9-lJThUsatjt38jNOFA

1 level below the main floor, there's a Hip Hop lounge and a Hip Hop room.  We did wander there for a little while to check it out before Deadmau5 came on.  The lounge was dead....only 5 or 6 people there.  That was strange....I bet they change the format of the music within a week or two.  The main Hip Hop room was jammed packed.  It too was well engineered for sound and lights.  I like how they put it in the center of the room and there's a walkway that goes around the perimeter...it makes for easy people watching and access to the main floor.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hakkasan-night-club-las-vegas?select=hwrokLedZcWP7zV_Zid10w#hwrokLedZcWP7zV_Zid10w

Overall, I rate this place 5 Stars and can't wait to come back as long as they continue to have great DJ's.

Tip:  Don't park at the MGM Grand.  It's 1000x easier to park at the Tropicana Hotel valet and walk over....seriously.

Return Factor - 100%

After hearing about Chef Marc's latest restaurant in Henderson, we took a little drive over there.  We called the original Novecento to confirm that they were indeed open. (Apparently, there was a soft opening going on the Thursday and Friday before where free pizzas were given out!)

On the Saturday we went, they had a BOGO Margherita pizza special going on.  The Margherita pizza was $8.99 each and toppings were $1 extra each.  They come out to about 10". We added toppings to one and kept the second one standard.  Since the staff are still training, we did notice that both pizzas came out quite different. Chef Marc came over to chat with us and he noticed our pizzas too. This is when things got exciting...

He invited us to the back to learn how to make a proper Napoletana (Neapolitan) pizza! No way! So the Husband washed up and headed into the kitchen and that's when we got a real education about this style of pizza.  I am far from an expert on pizza, but after the schooling we got, we were looking at pizza in a whole new way!

He explained how their dough is made and how long it sits, and demonstrated on how it's supposed to get pulled and stretched to just the right consistency. Then it's off to their fresh tomato sauce and the various toppings.  And a swirl of olive oil at the end is mandatory. And finally it goes into their 1000 degree oven and voila! the perfect Napoletana pizza!

But wait, there's more! You don't cut this kind of pizza! You pull the crusty edges and dip it into the tasty center where all the flavors have pooled together.  And when all the crust is gone, you get a knife and fork and eat it with utensils!! (I knew I wasn't the weird one for wanting to eat my pizza with a fork and knife all the time. And plus, there's never any wasted crust now!)

This pizza was pretty damn good and it made a huge difference having Chef Marc's passion and expertise in it. The whole experience was five stars!

When you go, be sure to tell them not to cut your pizza and bring on the knife and fork. You're going to eat this Napoletana pizza the way it was meant to be eaten!

Ever hear that saying "muscle weighs more than fat"? I don't know about you, but doesn't a pound of muscle weigh the same as a pound of fat?  You hear it all from time to time..."I'm not fat, I'm big boned", "it's baby fat", or "I weigh a lot because I have a lot of muscle" How do you know?  How do you really know if you've never been tested?  Yes, we can all do the eye test.  But if you're interested in knowing exactly where you stand with your body fat, you have to give Bod Pod a try. 

Bod Pod Las Vegas is located in Summerlin inside Anytime Fitness.  I've been tested before, but only through BF calipers.  However, there's about a 5% variance with calipers. In my opinion, that's way too big of a variance.  That's the difference between someone 15% BF and 20% BF.  The most affordable and closest to 100% accurate is the Bod Pod.  

Here's the process:
1.  Set up an appointment.  Cost is $50 for one test or $100 for three.  http://leanbodymetrics.com/

2.  Don't eat or workout at least 3 hours before your appointment.  Before you arrive, you will need to come prepared with the correct clothing.  Very important to wear minimal, form-fitting clothing such as compression shorts.  Women can wear a swim suit.  Both men and women have to wear swim cap, which they can provide if you do not have one. 

3.  Arrive at Anytime Fitness and complete a small questionnaire

4.  The Bod Pod is in a private room inside the gym.  You get weighed and then you sit inside the pod for 3 tests to ensure accuracy.  Dave is the best. He'll explain the process and later cover the data. 

5.  In less than 5 minutes, you get a print out of your body fat percentage, total body fat in pounds, and lean mass pounds/percentage.  From your numbers, you'll find out if you're risky (high body fat), excess fat, moderately lean, lean, ultra lean, or risky (too low).  Your overall numbers will also determine your resting metabolic rate (i.e. what your daily calorie intake should be). 

6.  You're done...Now, go eat and hit the gym. 

This is some pretty exciting and motivating stuff.  You don't have to be a fitness pro, bodybuilder, or athlete to be tested. If you're interested to finding out how much calories you need to gain or lose weight, looking to see if you're progressing in the right direction, or simply just want to know your true body fat percentage...then give Bod Pod a try. 


PS:  For me, it's no longer how much or how little I weigh.  It's all about body composition.  The scale keeps track.  But it's my body fat percentage that keeps score.  Dropped 5+ percent body fat since my last testing.  Yes, I'm keeping score and winning.  Yeah Buddy!!!

Simply amazing and completely fitting for a 500th review.  

I don't know that a more lengthy first sentence can do it any better. I'll spare you from the I went to Spain bullcrap, but I do know good Spanish dining on several different levels and Sol y Sombra overdelivers like a good night in the sack, and to help others this is completely worth the 30 mile drive north for Central Phoenix dwellers. 

If you walk away from this review with two tidbits, just know that the Tortilla Espanola (while basic-sounding and all) is the best $5 you will spend on a dinner. EVER.  With its huge impressive wedge appearance, it is more deliciously prepared and more filling than expected.  Also know that the wine list is lengthy and very comprehensive, but in an excellent way.  While I love Lola Tapas in Central Phoenix for its urban and sophisticated simplicity, this is one area in which it can't compete.

While the evening was more delightful because of our mailing-list 50-percent-off skillz, it should be even more noteworthy that such a thing is possible if you get off your duffs and give a brotha your email. 

Among other highlights would be the Pollo Colonial (a savory mix of sweet and spicy chicken curry), Grilled Calamari, Spicy Garlic Aioli Grilled Prawns, Grilled Asparagus.  But the most surprising of the night were the grilled brussel sprouts.  WTF?  I don't even like that shit.  But they grilled them with garlic, olive oil and seasoning, and if you do it that way it is ten times better than any veggie a teen would hate.  The Patatas Brava were just ok.  I still ate them, but they were a little more crispy than I care for.

The setting was impressive.  The dining room is grand, stylish and luxe in its understated way -- so symbolic of Madrid.  The layout and colors are complementary, trendy and tasteful all at once.  The patio is incredible if you can swing it.  There is not a bad seat in the house as the views from the second floor at DC Ranch are all great.

The host was accommodating given we were 10 minutes late (and called ahead) and the servers and sommelier were definitely helpful and steered us toward the right white wine we wanted for taste and value without trying to do the whole upselling crap.  The wine was excellent and was so fragrant and inviting that Melissa's purse had to have a taste.

Sol y Sombra is a definite five star destination restaurant that is worth it if you're coming from Central Phoenix, West Valley or SE Valley.

We came here recently, when a friend bought us a couples massage.  Our most recent visit brought back all my memories of this great Hyatt locale, just minutes from our front door. 

As I've previously noted, with some minor updating: "The rooms here are amazing, as are the guest services. Looking for Spa Day? Well this Hyatt is the place!  Looking for a beautiful sunset dinner by a fire pit?  No question, then you have to come here.  

If you are lucky to be a Diamond Club member, their Regency Club is one of the best in the world.  I would rank this Hyatt alongside Brenner's Park in Baden Baden; the Savoy or Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London for WOW factor. Simply outstanding!  Stay and enjoy the sunsets and Gondola ride after dinner!"

Our couples massage began with a relaxed, tranquil time outside in their shaded portico (photo), sipping cucumber and fruited mineral water, overlooking the Spa's private pool. 

After a few minutes, we were escorted to our room by two massage therapists to select our scented oils. The hour slipped by ever so slowly and was over before we realized it. Wow, they were very professional and made us feel renewed

But that wasn't the end of our visit. Again we returned to the portico and some quiet time by the pool. One of our friends who was also here for a Spa Day soon joined us. We enjoyed some delicious flavored teas for the rest of the afternoon and some good conversation. The shopping in the Hyatt, though small is excellent. 

As noted before, "...we have stayed at this Hyatt Regency many times when we lived elsewhere.  But now that we live in the valley, it has become a fun place to go for dinning (See: Alto Ristorante e Bar and SWB Southwest Bistro)."  

Come, eat, relax, stay, visit; you'll be glad you did!  Five Stars, simply the best!

Enjoy!!

Back in 1999, Kenny Guinn declared this part of Spring Mountain as "China Town" because apparently all Asians in Clark County are Chinese. Sure, you can argue that all Asian people did originate from the Chinese, but thats not the point. 

The Chinatown Plaza was the very first China themed mall in Chinatown. And today the Chinese community of Las Vegas is very honored that the most famous resident of Chinatown is Floyd Mayweather.

This shopping center has a Filipino Restaurant, a couple of Pho places, a ton of Korean restaurants, and a huge shopping mall to buy Chinese gifts and Beckoning Cats. Like only 30% of this shopping center actually features Chinese businesses.

Remember that Chinese food has a 5000 year history. So that's why so many of our favorite Japanese and Korean dishes look so similar. Every other Asian country stole their cuisine from China. A lot of you know that Ramen originated in China, but did you know that Sushi also originated in China  as well?

Most of us use this shopping center as a place to park because the shopping center with Ichiza, Yagyu Yakiniku, and Anime Ramen has no parking spaces. I've never been towed, but recently they hired this gigantic Native-American parking enforcer who looks f*cking scary!

When I first moved to Las Vegas, I immediately noticed that all the different ethnic groups of Asian people hated each other. There was a gigantic and vicious inter-Asian rivalry going on. I didn't like this one bit because as a young child, I grew up in Arcadia, where one of the most brutal concentration camps for Japanese-Americans once existed. As a child I remember seeing Chinese-Americans get told to "go back to Japan". During the LA Riots, many African-Americans in the area used to say racial slurs to Chinese-Americans, telling them to go back to Korea. My point here is that we as Asian-Americans all had to suffer together because they just don't care what specific type of Asian we are. Vincent Chin made this argument a fact when he was murdered.  

The very first documented Asian-American was actually Filipino. But, the very first large migration of Asian-Americans were Chinese. They paved the way for all the rest of us. Since they first set foot in the United States, they were hated and vilified for no reason at all.  In the 1850s,  a legislative was passed that made Chinese men unable to testify in court, in 1862 California residents voted that all Chinese residents should be taxed for being Chinese, 1878 the United States Government revoked every Chinese immigrants citizenship as Americans even if they were born in the USA, they were also prohibited from getting married, and in California it was NOT illegal to assault a Chinese man, in 1882 all Chinese immigrants are banned from entering the USA. Most of these laws were not repealed until the 1940s!! 

Frequently, I walk around in Chinatown and see a "westerner"acting completely disrespectful and making racist jokes towards every little Chinese decoration in the plaza.  The reason they do this is because the Chinese people are too polite to them and allow them to do this. These "westerners" should thank God everyday that they didn't do that in a Vietnamese district like Westminster California, because I guarantee that some Vietnamese guy would have beaten the living crap out of them, abducted them, and brought them to the backroom of a Pho restaurant and force them to play Russian Roulette. Yeah, it's called "Russian" Roulette, but the Vietnamese are the only people who are Man enough to play it. 

All I ask, is that you treat the Chinese with some respect when you come here. You don't see Chinese people  come into stores like "EXTREME John Smith's HARDCORE Dirt bikes, Surfboards, and Skate Shop" and disrespect you guys.

I have been here many times over the years. We came here 2 weeks ago, but It was time for another visit.  Stopped in to pick up an early dinner to go around 3:30pm.
Double cheese burger with Provolone and french fries.
 This is a grat place for a healthy Burger. They meat here is delivered fresh everyday.
High price for the burgers but, well worth it, because, the food is great!
This is better than what you can make at home.
Nice and clean inside, smells good, and looks nice.
We will come here again many times. My girlfriend does not even like Burgers, but she loves these.

I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said "what planet are you from?"...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says "Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy".

LMAO!

Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our "date night". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!

Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.

Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?

We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds. 

I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff.

Truly a tour de force of Spanish Cuisine.

Four visits, the most recent in the fall of 2014, e continues it's reign atop Vegas' culinary scene.

Seated in the bar of Jose Andres, glasses of Cava in hand, getting to know your fellow diners.  The hostess for the evening (and the sommelier) discretely interrupt each party to discuss water preferences and drink pairings.  As is Spanish tradition, always a little beyond the appointed hour, you're whisked away past the roaring fire and pans of cooking paella and into a secluded private, whimsical dining room.  Seated at a semicircular stainless steel counter, surrounded by hard woods and trinkets; representing the mind of the chef.   A hard knock on the solid kitchen door, the music of Spain fills the room, the chefs and servers enter and take their positions.  The experience begins.

E is about molecular gastronomy and modernist cuisine.  Perhaps a solid, foam sangria that magically dissipates on the tongue leaving the distinct flavor of wine and fruits, a thimble of soup with the pure essence of Spanish Jamon, liquefied olives that burst with the salty, briny taste of the real thing.  Artistry, flavor and pride are showcased in each dish as the head chef works in front of guest and describes each dish.  

Tip:  Wine pairings are essential.  They tie courses together and greatly enhance the experience.  Standard pairing $130, select pairing $300.  Opt for the select.  Incredibly well though out, running the gamut from sherry to 20 year cellared brooding reds, impossible to find whites and dessert wines.

20 courses grouped in three "flights".  Flavors of each small "starter" build on one another, as flavors of each and their accompanying wine pairing flow and compliment.  The progression makes the diner appreciate temperature and texture.  "Mains" provide contrast.  Flavors held together by the wine pairings that span more than one dish.  Finally desserts, with the boldest contrast between each to keep the palate yearning for more.

As always, with meals of so many selections, not everything will be to your taste.  All good, the next bite awaits.

Service is beyond reproach.  Unpretentious, friendly, very informative, perfect.

The experience for three diners with select wine pairing, incidental drinks, water, service and gratuity, $2,100.

Michelin three star worthy and a must in Vegas.

My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small "Noodle Pot" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. 

This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. 

For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.

P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.

The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeos. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.

My favorite hotel in Las Vegas hands down. The rooms are decor heaven with the best view on the strip. They also have balconies which is awesome and rare for strip hotels. 
The parking garage is also one of a kind. With each spot they have a pressurized sensor that either reads red for "spot taken" or green for "available spot" this makes parking less of a nightmare unlike a lot of garages.
 The Cosmo also has some of the best restaurants in Vegas. CHINA POBLANO by chef Jos Andrs created especially for Las Vegas showcases his personal take on Chinese and Mexican cuisines. Noodles and tacos come together in a festive, stylish setting. Ive tried the majority of items on the menu but my favorite are the chocolate tacos. amazing. STK is another one of my absolute faves. The bar is the centerpiece for this lively new aged steakhouse. This is a must visit place.
Marquee Day/Night Club- Vegas's newest hottest club on the strip. 3 stories of awesomeness and different themes for each, there is something for everyone here. The Library (3rd level) is my favorite. with the employees dressed up as librarians and the room rings true to an old fashioned library. 
The Boulevard Pool- Best place in Vegas for concerts. this venue is absolutely stunning with the palm trees and city center as the back ground. Its also pretty cool too because the crowd stands in the pool that s drained out for concerts, and the stage is up close and personal. very intimate setting.
Shopping- you cant forget the shops! DNA2050 is a one stop shop for the ultimate denim fit, style and trend. A boutique offering a unique and contemporary way to shop.
CRSVR Sneaker Boutique-Specializing in limited edition sneakers and men's & women's casually dressed up fashion.

All in all this is an amazing property and its def a must visit!!

Michelin rated 1 star. 

Bellagio hotel with a view of the waterfall show.

Need I say more.

Well, I'll say more than that.

The food was well executed and thought out. 

I tried the degustation menu.

First Course:

Sea urchin ice cream: This was like a sea urchin mouse. Subtle flavors but creamy and a hint of sea urchin, I taste more of the cream. Probably my least favorite of the tasting menu.

Foie Gras: Since California banned foie gras, I had to indulge as much as I can while I'm here. It had a small piece of foie gras on top of a raisin type of bread. I actually felt like the the foie gras tasted better along. The foie gras, i felt was a little over cooked but the it had some really tender areas. 

Chilean Sea Bass: This was probably the best dish. The sea bass was melt in your mouth, with a nice sauce to compliment it. Really good!

Suckling Pig: They gave you an assortment of pork, from the more dry area of the pig, to the more fatty area, it was a good variety into the pigs anatomy.

Cheese: They gave a nicely decorated flower shape cheese, it was very good, creamy and flavorful for cheese. 

Coconut Dessert: This probably was my favorite part of the dinner. The dessert came on an open coconut, inside was a mixed dessert of coconut, nuts, cream, and various other flavors, it was so good. I could of gotten another one.

The service of course of a Michelin starred restaurant was superb and the presentation of fabulous. 

Not the most amazing meal I had but definitely well thought out menu, service and presentation.

What I am about to say is going to be both hard to believe and incredibly shocking, but true. Completely, utterly, and brutally honest. Ready?

I would rather Z Pizza than any other thing on this planet. More than food, fame, wealth, love, sex, beauty... need I go on?

I have heard some less-than-stellar things about Z Pizza, so I have been giving my business (not THE business) to Pizza Heaven, but one fateful night I took an elevator ride with a Z Pizza delivery man who explained that they have both gluten free crust AND vegan cheese. It was awkward being that I had a Pizza Heaven equivalent literally right in my hand, but the delivery dude handled it with poise and handed me a magnetic business card.

Well, today it is rainy and I'm drunk and I was hungry and I didn't want to drive, so I gave Z Pizza a chance and I am so happy I did because my life changed today. 

Let me repeat that: MY LIFE CHANGED TODAY

This pizza, despite it being abnormal in every way possible, was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS. Get the Mexican (sans chicken and sour cream, of course)... you owe it to yourself. You really, seriously do.

I love this pizza so much that in future trysts, I will fantasize about this pizza instead of my lover. I really will.

I hate this review because I cannot even articulate the words to do this pizza justice. I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!

Oh, and PS... when I ordered they told me 45-60 minutes and it was here within 30. That's better than finding a rich guy that dresses well, doesn't have mommy issues, and is straight up hung. 

Did I just say that?

--How to look like a Celebrity, "JET style."--

1)  Wear the shortest metallic dress and tallest heels possible.  (Think Miss America, not 'Bigfoot Goes to Vegas').
2)  Walk directly up to the Host, look around nervously and whisper, "sorry we're late."
3)  While bypassing admission lines, cover your eyes with one hand because you have a migraine. (Everyone will think you're trying to avoid being spotted).
4) Pout with lips.  (For extra pouty, remember the time you borrowed - and ruined - your sister's designer purse and had to buy her a new one).
5) Look hungry. (For more dramatic affect, BE hungry).
6) If you arrive at 11:45 and free drinks end at 12:00, tip the bartender $20 and ask him to line up free shots for your friends to do in a three-round relay race.  (To make it classy, point your pinky out while holding your nose).
7) If you need to use the restroom here, DON'T.  It's gross, and friends don't let friends go potty here.  Leave the club and go potty in the lobby of the Mirage (okay, not IN the lobby, but in the restroom there) and THEN return to the club.   Your hand is stamped, and you'll easily be re-admitted.
8) If there's a performer the evening you're there, solicit an invite from the Host to the VIP table directly next to the stage.  If the 50 year-old you've been chatting with ALL night turns out to be married to an 80's icon, pretend like it doesn't faze you.  (But don't kiss him, because your karma already isn't looking pretty and being a homewrecker won't help).
9) Act like a $3,700 table service bill is not the highest one you have ever seen.  *cough*
10) Shield yourself from undesired advances until Warren G. performs RIGHT in front of you, takes photos with you, and then invites you and your friends up to his room for a risque night-cap.
11) Say yes to his hugs, but no to his drugs.  Politely decline the night-cap, because even though you might be DRESSED like a celeb who kisses her friends and snorts coke off the lower backs of rap stars, you most certainly are NOT one.

I'm pretty bias when it comes to eating at this popular chain.  Seems it doesn't take much to make me happy inside a Hooters restaurant.  Since I was staying in the hotel you would kind of figure that at least one of my meals would be at the Hooters restaurant.  I had lunch at this Hooters on the day of my departure.

Seated immediately near the front entrance I was in a perfect spot to view some very nice eye candy.  Most of the ladies smile as they walk by here.  It made me happy too!  My waitress was a nice German girl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=RAW5jfLOBzpLhYENbeiHbw).  She was very friendly, and I loved her accent, but she was an excellent waitress also.  Despite how busy this place is during a weekday lunch rush she came by three or four times to make sure everything was okay and I had enough food and drink.

I had a single order of ten wings, medium spicy and unbreaded (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=DYflGlGsO2mPs7T35u7a9g).  I also had an order of seasoned curley fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=UFYn0PR07eWLb0UUEaigEA).  The wings were excellent, but the fries could have had a bit more zest.  No complaints from me though.  I love all Hooters restaurants!

I have been a fan of Dan's food since the last place he was at.  When word came out that he was going to open a new place, I immediately started daydreaming on how long it would take to open.  I'll be the first to admit that I was very let down by the time it took to open Mucho Macho Taco(MMT).  Well guess what...you can't rush perfection!  First things first, this is not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  MMT is a Mexican fusion restaurant.  The combination of traditional Mexican dishes with a clever injection of culinary magic makes you feel as if you had discovered an extra sense you never knew you had!

Horchata...best I have tasted in Phoenix hands down!  Dan found a way to take his original recipe and kick it up a few notches(the dates that top this drink is a great touch).  I challenge my fellow Yelpers to point out a better tasting horchata in the Phoenix area.

Skirt Steak Taco...basically a carne asada taco that is so tender and has mastered this taco staple. 

50/50 Taco...it is a Skirt Steak Taco mixed with a locally sourced Chorizo that is greaseless and savory.  

Crispy Fish Taco...a Baja California favorite that Dan already had down pat!  I am not able to pinpoint what Dan and crew did differently here but they knocked this fish taco out the park.

Roasted Turkey Mole Taco...I had a mouth orgasm with this one!  They dominated a perfect smoke flavor along with celery and mole sauce.  I recommend that everyone taste this taco!

Braised Brisket Taco...this brisket is tender, moist and flavorful.  The union of the brisket, orange segments and cilantro truly packs a wallop to your taste buds.  

Bacon Taco...who will argue that anything with bacon taste bad?  A non-Merican that's who!  This locally sourced bacon tastes heavenly.  

Sopapillas...a appetizing dessert you find at most Mexican joints.  MMT has topped theirs off with an authentic cajeta, Mexican chocolate and pecans.  I don't eat flour but had to have a couple pieces of these sopapillas, well worth the stomach cramps!

I truly wish Dan and crew much success!  The first weekend that Mucho Macho Taco was open, it already appears that they have a contender for a title fight!

Last minute decision to finally drive to Montreal brought me to Hotel10 - thank you hoteltonight app. (I mean it was either that or watch Honeymooners reruns all weekend - Montreal won).

The location is perfect - walking distance from old town and port, right next to St Laurent with all its restaurants and bars, and close to St Denis if you want to do some shopping.

Design is modern chic, which I always loved. 
Complimentary bath robe, oversized rain umbrella and huuuuge shower are big plus. Keurig coffeemaker in the room is cool too.
It also pretty quiet - polished concrete ceilings (darn kewl), carpeted floors, and covered walls - good soundproofing. I saw college kids with party supplies go to room next door and was prepared for much noise - did not hear a peep.

Garage parking is convenient, and I am tipping my hat to most awesome valet. 
Free wifi - good speed.
Huge gym room, clean, spotless, with fresh towels and ice cold water.

Breakfast is Ok-ish, I rather prefer eating elsewhere. 
However, Jargo lounge at night is pretty decent to grab a drink or dinner.

One word to management and my only disappointment - is how they maintain it. Carpets on ground level need cleaning, headboards need to be dusted, and hairdryer bags need to be cleaned. I don't enjoy finding other peoples hair there.

I'm having Vegas withdrawal and writing a late review to ease my post-trip depression!

Wow! XS has got to be one of the best clubs with gorgeous colors and exquisite decoration! I was super electrified to step in and got a chance to party at one of the best clubs in my entire life just right here at Las Vegas. Very lavish, strikingly beautiful with astounding atmosphere. It's a clubbers' dream to party up here at XS! You've gotta venture up here to complete your Vegas trip. 

My highlights:
- I stayed at the Encore on Halloween weekend, which this club is situated in, which was SUPER CONVENIENT! It was literally only a few minutes walk from our room. 
-Beautiful women everywhere from all of the 7 continents around the world. 
-Ladies, go dip your feet into the shallow pool to wade on. 
-No designated drivers needed if you stay at Encore/Wynn hotel. Go get wasted!
-No lines since we had VIP access due to our bottle service. Great bouncers! They do re-entries. 
-The music, EDM, dubstep-y, & hip-hop-ish. It was Kaskade DJ'ing on our Halloween night! I did not know who was our DJ lineup until I came in hella buzz knowing it's actually Kaskade playing.
-Our stunning $1,000+ table on a cabana with comfortable couch with cushions by the celestial waters! Seriously, GET A BOTTLE SERVICE! If you have money to blow for a table, get one. Gentlemen, ladies will come up to you like a magnet if you get a bottle service/table for them to sit next to you. Worth the investment. After all, it's Las Vegas and money ain't a thing! 

Negative aspects: 
-Expensive. Just be prepared to have money to blow! I saw a special Dom Perignon 6L bottle for $25,000! Oh my goodness. It's on their menu. We stick with the Hennessy Privileg, LOL.
- I didn't really order a drink from the bar since we had a table. I heard their drink is about nearly $20~ a pop!
-It can get crowded inside. Thank goodness we have a table outside by the pool so we have our own space and room to walk around! 

Do yourself a favor: dress to impress, drink up, dance the night away, and make it one of the most memorable night in Sin city.

Regardless of where you are on Saturday, this is definitely the place to be on Sunday! Well, for brunch that is.

From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh "English tea party" inspired restaurant. 

The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!

In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.

Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!

However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!

So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!

Happy Eats!

A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    

The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.

Until the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food, drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff, dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars.

It's worth it.  
It's a dining experience of a lifetime.  
A dinner for 2 was more than my rent.  Way more.  
Still worth it.  

The bread cart is delicious.  They have bacon bread.  Score.  
The cheese cart is amazing.  I tried everything.  Everything.  
The little candy cart blew my mind.  
And everything before and after surpassed all of my expectations.  

I will say this though.  I enjoyed the regular menu items MORE than those with the supplemental price.  

And what's this?  A parting gift...for me?  Why, thank you.  They gave us a pistachio cherry pound cake for the road.  It was wrapped in purple cellophane, in a pretty black bag that marked the name of the restaurant.  That pound cake accompanied me to the Hard Rock for Gambling.  To a Strip Club.  To a night club.  More Gambling.  Made it through 4 cab rides.  And finally, back home to share with my culinary classmates.  

Just don't tell them the pound cake was inside Hustler.

On my last night in Vegas, I figured I'd hit the strip for some tried and true authentic Thai cuisine at none other than the famous Lotus of Siam. Located in a dilapidated old strip mall north of the main strip, you'd easily miss this place if you sneezed but make no mistake, this place is the real deal folks! At check in, we were told it would be a grueling 45 minute wait. We were then invited to the bar to pass the time.  Needless to say, we enjoyed a shot or two at the bar and made some new friends in some cool gals.  Before we knew it, our table was ready! Way less than 45 minutes I might add.

Our server was kind courteous and very helpful. She took our orders and within moments, our tasty dishes were basking on our table.

Sea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun, you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish! Order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you'll be good to go! Satisfaction guaranteed!

Crispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce, I was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry, awesomely delicious!

Garlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma I've experienced in years. It will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite!

Overall, awesome service, impeccable food and good times = A+++ from this guy 

Happy Eats!

las noches de las luminarias may be one of the most perfect ways to spend an evening during the holiday season:)

It's been a while since I could say I was "enchanted" by anything...I was enchanted by las noches de las luminarias at Desert Botanical Garden:-)

The Beautiful Carin and I had not been to las noches de las luminarias ("lndll":) before...in fact, when she told me we were going, I think I said something to the effect "it's just another way to separate us from our money at Christmas time...Bah...Humbug!!!" :-)

Carin said something like "lighten up Ebenezer", and off we went:)

Well, lndll does separate you from a little cash to get in and a little more to have a toddy or three by the fire...but it's money well spent...maybe even money well invested:)

We got into the garden shortly after sunset and I have to say, I was awed from start to finish!

As we walked in, we were greeted with spectacularly lit Chihuly Glass cacti, along with hundreds of luminarias lighting our path...the soft sounds of a mariachi band playing just inside the entrance, adding a distinct Sonoran feel to the experience:)

Once inside we wandered around and just simply enjoyed all that was happening and all that we were seeing...around one corner, the path led through a small stand of dimly lit Pipe Organ Cacti...around another bend, a bluegrass band playing from a perch nestled between giant boulders...over there, a children's handbell choir playing holiday favorites...always with the silhouette of Papago in the background and luminarias and well placed decorative holiday lighting in the plants to guide us:)

No one seemed to be in a hurry...no one pushed or raced along the paths...everyone smiled and chatted with each other...we had a number of brief, cheery conversations with people that we had never seen before and will never see again...we helped a couple of snowbirds that had a stuck wheelchair (I helped with a song in my heart and smile on my face..not like me at all...my heart must be growing 3 sizes! :-)...here, during lndll, it was just what you do!

As the evening grew a little late and some of the luminarias began to flicker and die, we found a spot next to the fire in the Berlin Agave Yucca Forest and had a couple of Steaming Hot Martini's (I have no idea what was in them, except liquor...but they were tasty and warming and they made us happy:)

We sat there for a while and talked as we watched the fire, the flickering luminarias and the dwindling crowds...and I came to the conclusion that this might have been one of the best Christmas investments ever.

I hope you'll go and invest in Desert Botanical Garden, lndll and yourself...it's more than worth the price of admission:)

Save me a spot by the fire and I might even buy you a Steaming Hot Martini :-)

Once upon a time, this was an awesome property.  Now, it's suffering from old age and a lack of investment.  Here's the breakdown:

PROS
- Pretty cool pool area.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the hotel.....it's tropical, has real pink flamingos, and is fun.

- Cheap rates.  You can find rooms in the high $30's to $40 range here often.  I send my budget minded friends here.

- Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville.  This place is a lot of fun.  It overlooks the Strip and has decent eats and fun music.  I'll have to write a separate review one day for it.

- Cheap gambling.  Most of their table games have low minimum bets.

- Location.  It's center Strip and It's on the monorail line.  Easy access up and down the East side of the Strip from the Sahara to the MGM Grand on the monorail.  Reasonable walking distance from Paris to Palazzo (50% of the Strip).

CONS
- It's old and it shows.  This place peaked in the mid-90's.

- It reeks of smoke.  The last time I was there I walked from the parking garage to Margaritaville and back without stopping in the casino.  However, when I got home my clothes smelled as if I was out all night gambling and smoking cigarettes.  Blech.

- Parking garage has small, tight spaces.  This is one of my least favorite parking garages in the city.  The spaces are small and I'm always afraid that my car is going to get scratched or dented.....because it has happened in the past. 

- They have timeshare sales people that will bother you when you walk by their booth.  I'm not a fan of this at all.  Who wants to be bothered like that on vacation or on a night out?  It's no different than those escort card smackers on the Strip.

Overall, you have to understand what you're getting here and it's cheap.  So if you're on a budget, this hotel is for you.....but don't have high expectations otherwise you'll be disappointed.

Will I return?  Sure.

We had family visiting from out of State. So Rawhide is closed on Monday and Tuesday now days. I guess they are not doing to well lately.
So instead we went somewhere that I have never been either. A Ghost town out in Apache Junction. I never knew ,but it is a real Gold mine.
Anyway, back to the restaurant. This place was recommended to us by the Train conductor.  We were so glad that we listened.
It was a very cool little place with an interesting history. They too claim that it is haunted by the past owner of an old Shell station that used to be there.
That is a fun little story that you can read about while there.

The menu has a lot to offer ,all sorts of different choices. They have something for everyone. The server comes to your table with chips and salsa and your drinks.
We all got something a little different and all of it was really good.
They have a full bar ,and even chocolate milk for the younging we had with us. (She was very happy).
We had the Philly with steak, Hamburger, Cheeseburger, and Prime Rib. Everyone really liked all the food. They even have a child's menu.
After the kids are through eating they bring them a Vanilla ice cream cone. AWESOME!
The prices are very reasonable as well. Plenty of parking in the front and the back.
Decorated with lots of cool old things and it is clean in there as well. A major plus for an older place.
I would go back any time. In fact we are looking forward to it.

Dolla dolla bills, y'all... on the ceiling, that is. This place is covered with personalized dollar bills, and if you look closely enough you'll see some Chilean currency up there courtesy of my group the other week. 

It seems like everyone has that one dive bar that they're just in love with, where the bartenders know you and hook you up with a free drink or two once in a while, where the ambiance is nothing to write home about but somehow it always manages to provide a good time. This seemed to be the place for my Phoenix coworker, the lovely Lindsey F, and she raved about it the whole week we were visiting her in Scottsdale. Finally, on the last night we were able to stop by to see for ourselves, and it lived up to the hype! 

This is the kind of place where there's no need to ask for a drink menu. In fact, I'm pretty sure they don't even have a drink menu. Just order a beer off the tap or your go-to cocktail, or ask the bartender to surprise you with a special shot (something we did quite a few times and weren't disappointed). 

If you request a song with the DJ it's likely to come on about 10 seconds after, which is awesome and rare. It's here that I first learned of the Cupid Shuffle, though it seemed like everyone else in the bar was already a pro. Old dudes, college kids, everyone seems to gather here to relax, and there's plenty to keep you occupied. 

You might think these places are a dime a dozen, but it's actually a fine craft to perfect the ideal dive bar. So congrats, Pattie's - you may not have craft cocktails but you have the craft of dive bars down pat(ties)!

So I tried going to Drais MDW. That was a fail. I shall literally break it down.

It was after midnight Saturday night when I text the promoter Kim Paul, asking him the price for entry that night. $30 for men, $20 for women is what he said. So awesome. We were set to go. Everything else that night was over $100 for men.

We reach the cashier. Chelse, blonde, thin, early 20s. My girlfriend pays $20 cash for herself. Left is me, 1 other girlfriend and her boyfriend. I was going to pay with my card and they were going to give me the cash. So she rings me up for a total of $70. Sounds right: 20 + 20 + 30.

No. She says "now what about her?" (Referring to my friend right beside me). I said "yeah, $20, $20, $30." N she looks at me like I'm stupid. "No it was never $30 for men. It was actually $40 and that was before guestlist which closed at midnight so it's $50." I tell her "the promoter Kim Paul just told me it was $30. So I want my money back." She says "sorry, there are no refunds" all super bitchy like she owns the place. Lol. So I said "ok well bring me a manager on duty." She says "sure."

Comes back with another doofus and after I explained the situation, he said nothing. Just went to tapping on the screen. After 10 minutes, I get a "void check testing admission" receipt but total said $0.00. I ignored it and left assuming he should've known what he was doing. I'll check my account tomorrow. Silly me.

So here I am back in California calling everyday asking for a manager. On Monday I was able to reach Victor Drai's assistant. Woman. Don't recall her name. She took my name and phone number and also check number from my receipt. Of course they aren't going to call me back, so I call once a day asking for Victor Drai not knowing he was the owner. Just hoping it was the person who would post void the transaction already.

Well he was not happy to hear from me. He answers with his strong Moroccan egotistical accent "how the fuck did you get my number" and "what the fuck do you want" and "give me your fucking number my assistant will help you, not me." So I say "well she's the reason why I call asking for you because she was not able to help me." He says "you're making that up" and again "I'm not going to help you. Give me your number. Do you want to be fucking helped or not!?" I respond with a "Wow you are ridiculous" and he clicks.

I call back and finally a normal person answers and asks how did I get Victor's number. I simply said I didn't. They transfer me when I ask for him. So he new guy gives me the general manager's email so they can help me. I pray to God this is the end of it.

By far the worst customer service experience ever.

Already a fan of the location on East Tropicana, I was excited when Tia Shirley B. informed me that a new Taco y Taco would be opening in this part of Henderson, close to where I work, work out often, and have many friends who live in the area (including Shirley B.).  A friend and I headed here last Saturday after a long training ride, ready to get our taco on.
     Just after opening at 11:00am, we walked in to find a spacious restaurant complete with bright lighting, high ceilings, a bar, and staff that greeted us heartily; this used to be the Republic Kitchen & Bar restaurant, so it may be the nicest taco place I've visited. I was quite surprised to see a DJ mixing tunes at that time of day, but not a bad thing. There were a couple of other customers already eating and the place got progressively busier during our visit.
      Set up like the other location, there are stations where you can order tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.
     Meat choices: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).   There's a salsa bar with lots of options for you to add to your order.
    I had two al pastor tacos with pineapple, a carnitas vampiro (two crispy tortillas with the meat and cheese inside), and Mexican street corn on the cob (elote) with the works (mayo, cheese, and chili powder)--I was hungry one minute and then full the next.  My friend had never been to Taco y Taco before and he gobbled up his food before I finished.   
   This Taco y Taco gets five stars from me for the location, the tasty food, and the service; I'll definitely be here a lot.  BTW, for those fellow Yeeps who've been missing Tia Shirley B. while she's been off Yelp, she's been here almost every day since they opened so you may see her when you visit!  Buen provecho, mis amigos--la vida es demasiada corta para ser descontento o comer comida mala.

New hot spot alert! Buddha Belly Deli! You're gonna find sandwiches like Pho Dip and Chicken Katsu Club here!  Sandwiches, flatbreads, salads, and sweets with an Asian Fusion twist! 

This place is still in the early stages of their soft opening but they are open for business and ready serve up some good eats.
 
I was super stoked when I was reading the temporary menu laid out on the counter.  Love that they have gluten free and some vegan choices like housemade Taro and Potato Chips with Furikake seasoning.

I ordered 9th Island Potato salad as my side to go with the Char Siu Pork Roll. I also got to try a basket of Taro and Potato chips.  My sandwich looked so pretty and was pretty dang good too! It had marinated pork shoulder and these kimchee pickle slices. .the Hawaiian roll was made inhouse. The chips were super thinly sliced. The potato in the potato salad was cooked to perfection, not too crunchy or mushy. Love the medley of Asian seasonings and spices used in all the dishes. 
 
Staff is really cool and friendly. It's Chef Clint and Mark I bugged that day. They are two of the 3 owners I met. Both are the creative geniuses behind the Ono (Yummy, Good) eats! Judging from Thai Tea and 5 spiced Carrot cupcakes I tasted, Mark is a bakery whiz too! Oh wow, someone is going to gain a Buddha belly here for sure.
 
This visit was into their second day of soft opening so they still are in the process of setting up. The sign on the storefront is up but storefront tinted windows are still bare and give no indication that there is a cool place residing there. The previous place was East Coast Eats..right in the strip mall where Kohls is.  They did a good job with the reno so far. Not much to more to comment on yet till after a few more visits. 

Grand opening is next weekend I believe. 4.995 for now!  I know I'll be back before then and update this review soon. So excited! And you will be too!

My Sweet lovers guide to vegas treats!!

Jean Phillipe patisserie is a must. They have two locations, bellagio with the famous chocolate fountain display  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=5CTu6r-oMEnATEqkMQFtYg and the one at Aria  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg which is bigger and has an area to sit down and indulge. U can have a variety of cakes, gelato, chocolates, crepes, pastries.. They do not sell individual macarons but u can buy a packaged set. The crepe, mousse cake and creme brulee gelato I had were all excellent!

Max Brenner @ Caesars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=VM3v-ly8TaqF6Gi21XOCTg is chocolate lovers dream! The chocolate smell wafting alone is intoxicatingly delicious. They not only have a boutique of chocolate treats, u can eat a fabulous meal here and make sure to get a chocolate chip walnut cookie: the best I ever had! 

Check out sugar factory at PH http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pNR0cAPdO4RHulVTFssn-A?select=eFmRocS3vcKGcJNlBTibOQ if u love gummies, lollies etc. but the cupcakes, macarons, gelato looked pretty ordinary.

Bouchon bakery at the Venetian  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=U4VwyUcdlz4Mlsl3hqb5Ug is a great stop if you've never been to any of the bouchon bakeries. It's a small stand as opposed to a shop. Signature bouchons r always great, their macarons r not my fave but huge and pretty. A new fave for me is their carrot whoopie pie!

Vosges at the Forum shoppes is a cool place to check out if u like exotic flavor chocolates. But it can be  pricey.
If u like banana cream pie, the one at Emerils at MGM is awesome!

I went to Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=v2QzpbqjH_ok7MlKhQsnpw expecting awesome desserts but altho beautiful, I was not too impressed.

Didn't get to check out Payard at Caesars but they have macarons there, altho i'm sure they don't beat Paulettes (now called Lettes) in LA.  Dessert at Wynn buffet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg was disappointing

Other highlights of vegas eats for me was Cosmopolitan pizza, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon@ MGM and Earl of Sandwich @ PH.

Shows: Jabbawockeez at Monte Carlo was super fun and very memorable!

If ur going from LA, if they r open, make sure to visit My Delight Cupcakery in Ontario on the way home. They have the best cupcakes around!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-delight-cupcakery-ontario#query:my%20delight%20cupcaker

The best restaurant to come along in quite some time. They don't take reservations, but it gave me time to go check out the specialty cocktail menu. For $8, these drinks are a preview of how reasonable the rest of the menu is. I tried the bourbon peach tree cocktail and it was heavy on the alcohol. Besides the bourbon, all you can taste is the mint. It was not well balanced, but for someone who likes their brown liquors, this is great. I still liked it. The Hot & Bothered was my favorite though. The mixture of spicy and sweet was phenomenal. The mango syrup was not too overbearing and the spice lingered on your lips. 

I sat in the lounge for 20 minutes before someone came to get my guest and I. We were taken upstairs to our table. Within minutes our server came by to introduce herself and I tried to get a few recommendations. With such a spectrum of items being suggested, it did not make it any easier. 

What we ended up deciding on was astounding. For starters, we got the "over the rainbow" salad and the bone marrow carne asada. Holy cow are they amazing. The best contrast of something healthy with a heart stopping appetizer. The mixture of grains with corn and veggies had me shoveling it down. The fatty goodness of the bone marrow had me wanting more. A squeeze of orange cuts the fat. As our protein, we went with the Spencer steak. $25 for a ten ounce steak with housemade chips and a mushroom rockefeller. What a deal! When we got it, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. With that, you get a choice of sauce. Initially, we ordered the green peppercorn thinking it would pack some bold heat. It is more creamy and possessed little flavor. Afterwards, we asked for the chimichurri and that was much better. The capers in it had me scooping it up. Adding the crispy cauliflower tossed with chili de arbol and portabello fries was more than enough for two. If I had to choose between the two again, I'd go with the former. The sweet and spice of the florets had me wanting to plan another visit. The meatiness of the fries were good, but the aioli was what made them. We were dipping anything we could get our hands on in it. I was ready to tap out, but Sarah Marie wanted to see the dessert menu. They don't have one, but our server broke down all of their desserts for us. They only have sundaes. I was a littl surprised by that, but I am a huge ice cream fan. We ended up with the salted turtle sundae. The roasted peanuts, toffee pieces, salted caramel, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream was to die for. We were filled to the brim, but that sundae did not go to waste. 

All in all, it was the best dining experience I could have asked for. We ended up hanging out there for quite some time. Their timing was perfect. I didn't even realize that we had a three hour dining experience because they always had something in front of us and the pace was so controlled.

A theater where I can recline in my chair with my feet up and watch a movie? I'm in! The ticket price for adults is $11 per person plus a $1 convenience fee when purchasing online. You get to pick your seats which I thought was nice. The website is user friendly and once you have picked your seats (hurry because if you wait too long to decide someone else can snatch the seats) and completed your purchase, the seats are reserved for you, so you wont need to worry about getting to the theater in time to get a certain seat or seats together with your group.

Inside they have the typical concession area with popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, etc., but they also have a sausage bar and sell beer and wine. There are separate lines for the concession and sausage/alcohol bar, but the employee at the sausage bar let me get my nachos and soda combo ($12) at her line so we could just pay with one transaction. She was courteous and let me know that customers get free soda refills on the date on the receipt. 

We saw "The Lego Movie" and I was happy with the plush reclining seats. I made myself fast at home in mine! Each chair has a button on the side to adjust the seat however you want it. I liked that when I moved mine it wasn't felt by the person next to me so I didn't feel bad about adjusting it whenever I wanted. The table attached was decent sized too. The screen was huge and the movie looked good. I just about fell asleep I was so comfy! 

There is a parking garage (free parking) or a open lot. If you plan to go to the movies often, you might want to consider signing up for Galaxy Rewards, it's free.

Now let's sing!

One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. 

Want a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? We've got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abs-so-freakin-lootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  

It seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you don't see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. 

Well I believe Dazzo's is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, "thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?"  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! 

And if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. 

Okay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef -- they have them all and they're cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!

Another plus are their French fries. They're exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. I'm not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. 

But when I do come back, I'll bring more Cash because they don't accept Plastic. 

Enjoy!

My friends and I were ready to party, and decided to hit up Haze, just inside the new Aria/City Center. With the VIP passes in hand, we lined up and waited about 15 minutes before entering. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=AUKfTd2nLQcqk8Mn1hqc4g  I was impressed at how orderly the lines were, as the ropes separated the lines for the Girls, Guys, and VIPs or Bottle Service. There were bouncers, who answered questions and directed people where they should stand.

So, we have been the first to enter, but didn't mind since we scoped out a place to get situated as we opted out of the bottle service. Check out the tables with the bottle service http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=HuQqKeF5rkkcSQ-JpftF-g  

Club wasn't as big as I expected with two floors, with the smallish dance area on the first floor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=Ok_8epfJHBDz0ZLOOP0VmQ
Music was decent, with a mix of hip hop, r&b, etc., and my friends and I busted a groove. It eventually did get super packed and hot, so Li and I decided to mosey over to the downstairs bar area. There we hung out with our friends, and proceeded to even make new ones who were kind enough to buy us drinks :0  From what I recall, the wait for a drink was never longer than 5 minutes.
 
Bathrooms are clean and has all the girly necessities (hair spray, mints, etc.,) and thankfully, there was never a long line. 

Haze is a cool club, and the week before Leighton Meester made an appearance, and the day after I hit up Haze, Common was appearing. Duoh, talk about bad timing. Fail! Oh well, whatcha gonna do?

Anywho, I had a blast with my friends (old and new) and stayed out partying til 4am. I recommend getting the VIP passes and lining up early. The fellas should be prepared to pay the cover. As with most LV bars and clubs, drinks are not cheap. However, you might be lucky (like a few people I know) to not have to drop any cashola for one drink the entire evening.  

Cheers and party on til the break of dawn!

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

I've had this Bosnian restaurant bookmarked for some time and finally my friend and I were able to stop by for dinner. Located in a tiny strip mall, the dcor was neatly arranged with cultural artifacts, white table clothes, and the atmosphere was spacious and cozy. 

The menu was smaller and more affordable than my visit to Saraj. We decided to start off with a Home Style Bean Soup ($5) filled with light tasting Bosnian beans and chunks of beef here and there. Very hearty as the bowl warmed the belly. The beans boast wonderful flavor with hints of beef to render depth. The owner was very generous to give us a second serving so there was plenty to share.  

Next, the Stuffed Cabbage ($5) arrived with boiled cabbage stuffed with ground beef that came with onions, peppers, and other seasonings with a dollop of sour cream on top. The cabbage was soft, naturally sweet, and easy to bite into. The ground beef had some pop due to the seasonings with a nicely broth to bring to a finer note. They were much bigger than the ones at Saraj as there were plenty of ground beef to fill the center. So delicious, it's something I'm eager to have again.

Their highly recommended item, the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich ($7), came with 10 pieces of small Bosnian sausages sandwiched held in-between two thick fluffy fried breads. The bread was slightly browned and crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The sausages were savory delicious and wonderfully seasoned. The sandwich also came with creamy red pepper sauce and raw onions to ignite sweet and sharp contrasts.

The extra fried bread for the bean soup was superfluous. Service-wise, the server was Bosnian but not particularly knowledgeable about the cuisine. The owner, however, was very warm, friendly, and managed to come out of the kitchen to greet us and address questions. Interested diners should know that they also have authentic Bosnian items that are not listed on the menu. 

4.5 stars. Cheaper, bigger, and better than Saraj. This is one of the most overlooked places in the Valley. I would love to come back to try their veal and assortment of desserts.

How could I pass up a sign that says "All you can drink sake." and "Grand Opening"?  I had been craving sushi for a while and was seriously considering going so their advertisement worked.  I was disappointed to hear they didn't have AYCE, but preceded with ordering roll determined to consume more sake than food.   I don't remember in which order I ordered the rolls, but each one was better than the last.  The Tsunami, Gentlemen's Club, Show Me the Love and Cowboys were all delicious.  

As originally planned, I had a bottle of sake with each one.  I tried the sake First cold, then hot and finally just room temperature which was my favorite; although I did feel like Goldilocks by the time I was done.  The sake, sushi and service was very good as I felt I had the place to myself...actually I did have the place to myself.  

Now if you were thinking how did he drive home after 4 + plus bottles of sake don't worry, I walked to my home as it's just down the street.  Since this was the grand opening they also handed out a $10.00 gift card for your next visit.  I'll be back for round 2 soon!

As many of my yelp friends know, I am still an activist for anti-discrimination of Asian-Americans. Many of the top Asian-American elitists who are members of our organization meet together once a month. 99% of the the time we meet at either Sushi on Rainbow or HONEY PIG. It's just become our spot to discuss business. Also, we consider the honorable Mr. Jake Lee to be quite a respected figure in the LV Asian-American community, so we eat here to show our respects to him. Mr. Lee is so respected that even the Japanese members of our agency see him as a great role model for their community.

I'm a Yakiniku guy. But, HONEY PIG is the only Korean BBQ that I would prefer over Yakiniku(for those of you who do not know, Yakiniku is the Japanese variation of Korean BBQ). Yakiniku restaurants are known for using very high quality meats, but the beef at HONEY PIG is much more tender and higher in quality than even the most expensive Yakiniku joints in San Diego or LA.

There are lots of really good choices here in LV for AYCE Korean BBQ, but they just can't compare to HONEY PIG. Sura is also a great choice, but it can't touch THE PIG.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sura and the service is really good but HONEY PIG just has much more superior quality meats and it's  always perfectly marinaded. I hate how at the other Korean BBQ joints in town, they rush the preparations and the meat does not have that full flavor of the marinade. You won't get that problem here at THE PIG.   

Just to let you yelpers know, you can't satisfy Korean customers. You can bring your Korean friends to the best Korean restaurant in the world and they will still give it 1-star.  Korean's always compare restaurants to their mother's cooking and if it doesn't taste like Mom's kalbi then it officially "sucks" to them. So if you are Korean, then maybe don't come here. If you are Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc then come on over.  

Some yelpers are claiming that the staff won't treat you well unless you are Korean. That's just not true. Most of us are very visibly Japanese, and we get VIP treatment.  I don't know, maybe they just treat us good because we spend so much money.  I mean, if you are Asian-American and your household doesn't have investments and assets worth at least over 1.5 million, you probably should be pretty embarrassed to call yourself Asian.

Mr. Lee does a very good job with his restaurants. I see some people wondering if the HONEY PIG in Los Angeles is related to this location, and the answer is that his brother owns that one. 

All I can say is that I got nothing but respect for Mr. Lee and his HONEY PIG. What a great restaurant to have here in LV.

***Picasso's food is not incredibly creative, but it is very nicely prepared (and the flavors are good)***

Picasso features a prominent chef (Julian Serrano) and many Picasso paintings throughout the dining room.  The paintings are not the only nice touch; there is an outdoor dining area that sits right on Lake Bellagio (large windows also give indoor dining guests a view of Lake Bellagio and the fountain shows).

The dining room was bigger than I expected.  It was not stuffy, but I did not like all of the design choices.  Seating was comfortable and I liked the color of the walls as well as the nice ceiling.  I was not a fan of the carpet (or the chair backings).  I think they were trying to embrace the Picasso theme, but it made the dcor feel out-of-date.

Picasso is a French restaurant and there is a tasting menu and a pre fixe menu (not much difference in price; tasting menu provided one additional course).

I opted for the tasting menu, which started with an amuse bouche of warm potato soup topped with crunchy almonds.  There was also a pheasant croquette garnished with prosciutto.  The soup was good.  I liked the croquette, but you do not get much of a pheasant flavor.

There were several complimentary bread options.  The raisin and walnut bread stood out the most.   There was a great mix of crunchy nuts and sweet dried fruit.  The very hearty bread also had a great crust and chew.

My first course was Maine lobster with micro greens, cherry tomato, avocado, celery, melon, and an apple-champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was fresh, light and refreshing.  I liked the lobster, which was lightly sweet, moist and tender.  While I liked the lobster, it did not have the softness of the lobster in the lobster salad at Vincenti (Brentwood).

My second course was a pan seared scallop that sat on potato mousseline.  There was also a port wine reduction.  The scallop was very good.  It had a great caramelized crust.  The scallop was also fresh, moist and soft.  I also liked the potato mousseline, which was buttery and creamy.

The dish as a whole though was a little underseasoned.  The port wine sauce did not add much and there needed to be more bold flavors on the plate.

My third course was the sauted foie gras, which was topped with almonds (the foie gras sat on brioche).  There was also a blood orange sauce as well as rhubarb and rhubarb puree.  This was a very good dish.  There was a great mix of flavors (sweet, salty, tart) and textures (crispy, creamy, crunchy).

I really enjoyed the foie gras.  It had a great outside sear while the inside was velvety, smooth and buttery.  The almonds were great.  The toasted brioche was a little too toasted (almost crouton like).  I really liked the rhubarb and rhubarb puree.  It was a great mix of sweet and tart and it went well with the savory foie gras.

My main course was the roasted loin of Colorado lamb, which was served with mint aioli, tempura zucchini, tomato, and ratatouille.  The lamb loin was very good.  It had a great outside color and flavor.  The meat was tender and juicy (great flavor).  There was a nice amount of fat marbling, but it was not too much.

The sides were pleasant and well prepared but simple and straightforward.  I liked the flavor of the ratatouille as well as the light crispiness of the tempura zucchini flower.

My dessert course was caramel roasted pear with warm hazelnut frangipane cake,  ice cream and crushed hazelnuts.  I really liked the caramel roasted pear.  It had a good flavor (the caramel was sweet but not heavy).  The pear also had a great texture--tender but not mushy.

The ice cream was creamy and smooth and had a good flavor (though I was expecting a more distinct flavor).  The frangipane was decent (kind of simple but thankfully not too dry).

The meal ended with petit fours.  The petit fours were pleasant--not as innovative or ambitious as the very good petit fours I've had at places like Cyrus (Healdsburg) or Providence (Los Angeles).

Service was very good--personable, pleasant, polished, professional, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but their tasting menu is less expensive than what you will find at some Vegas restaurants.  In terms of similarly priced Vegas restaurants, I thought the food at Picasso was better than Le Cirque, Michael Mina and Aureole.

Picasso is a pleasant and satisfying Vegas fine dining restaurant.  I do not think Picasso would compete well with top Bay Area restaurants because the food is not as ambitious or creative.  Still, the food is good and very nicely prepared, which makes it a good option for a special occasion meal in Vegas.

The Bellagio has its own free parking structure (self-parking).

Arizona's okay. 

Arizona when drunk is awesome.

When coming to Shotgun Betty's, your perspective will probably be influenced greatly by your expectations and also your gender. And, the time of day you visit.

If you're a guy and you just want to get drunk at a bar (and don't want to get dressed up to do it), Shotgun Betty's will satisfy your cravings both for liquor and eye candy.

The girls who work here are pretty much all 9s and 10s in a porn video sort of way (I mean that as a compliment), and they are all friendly enough, especially if you have a roll of dollar bills.

If you hand out fives and tens you might earn a nice, Cointreau-flavored kiss, depending on the girl.

It's crowded because it's such a low-pressure bar and they let in everyone. The drinks suck, but it's a dive and the girls have a "but I'm pretty" excuse going for them.

A huge percentage of the patrons will be total dirtbags and creeps, but what do you expect when the girls gyrate on stripper poles and there's no cover charge to get in.

If you're a girl coming to this bar, you'll be in the minority because most of the patrons are boozed up men, whose attention will be given to the hottie dancing on the bar in her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots. 

If you come in for a boozer-nooner, and enjoy a meal at the bar, you'll find that the girls who work here are not mindless airheads. Not that they're going to work on the space station sometime in the future, but they're really cool.

Mixed drinks are much better during the day because there's not such a huge crowd, it's light outside, and the girls probably have more time to gin the tonics and coke the rums.

The music is mostly rock and roll, with bits of metal and country thrown in for good measure. Such a soundtrack always bangs, but after your fifth Jaeger bomb it's positively orgasmic.

So, when you come back to your real town, and your friends say, "Hey man, what did you do this weekend?" And you reply, "Went to Arizona," and they come back with, "Oh, sorry..."

--you can hit them with, "Yeah I went to Scottsdale."

"Did you go to Shotgun Betty's?"

"That's why I went to Scottsdale."

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

You say they have a groupon for $95? Plus an additional 15% off?!

Sooo totally there.

It was worth it! $145 value (I manually calculated it...lol) Amazing 5 course tasting menu that caters to 2 and they are all standard sized portions. Not to mention, everything was insanely scrumptious! I would buy this exact groupon over-and-over again if the opportunity arises.

I've been burned by groupon before, where the restaurant would shamefully treat us like second-class citizens. Nope, not at Nobu - they treated us like VIP from start to finish. We were also celebrating our anniversary that evening and our server and all of the top-notch staff, made sure we enjoyed ourselves. We felt extremely taken care of (plus it was a busy night for them.)

Complimentary to start the unforgettable evening: 
+ Sparking voss water - bossy! 
+ Extra plump and sweet, steamed edamame with delicious crunchy maldon salt - savor every morsel

Accompaniments: 
+ Freshly brewed soy sauce. The flavor was smooth and refined
+ Fresh wasabi paste - talk about a head kick! Also smooth, bold and wonderful flavor
+ Crisp pickled ginger - perfect palate cleanser. Not overly sweet or sour, just right

5 courses: 
//Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeo and cilantro// $25
You better believe it's better than butter. Enjoy a little piece of cilantro in every bite, to brighten up all of the flavors. 

//California roll & chefs selection nigiri// $44
Tuna, fluke, salmon. Flip them, enjoy fish-side-down and let the fish just melt on your tongue. Each fish was extremely fresh, sweet, and delectable. Also, I never thought I would say this, but even the simple CA roll was scrumptious! The sushi rice was cooked to mouthwatering perfection. I was so upset when it was all gone.

//Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce// $24
Extra crispy and battered to extreme perfection. The addicting crunch makes it so wonderful. Subtle spices and perfectly creamy. Make sure to eat it with the spicy arugula and sweet baby greens underneath - they really add in another dimension of flavor! 

//Black Cod Miso// $37
The dish that put Nobu on the map - Black Cod Miso with pickled ginger root. Sweet, luscious, and sensational. The fish was prepared with extreme precision. 

//Bento Box// $15
Happy anniversary written in beautiful script using white chocolate sauce, with a warm molten chocolate fondant cake garnished with berries, shiso syrup, scrumptious green tea ice cream and a surprising, rich expresso soaked tiramisu topped with a Nobu emblem cracker. They were all beyond perfection. I can firmly state that Nobu also has desserts down to a delicious science. 

Nobu offered us an unforgettable dining experience and such a romantic anniversary, we are already looking forward to our return.

Those who know me will tell you I am one difficult person to impress, a fact that still has my mother wondering where she could have gone wrong. But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine. 

If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.

But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right. 

And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.

Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures. 

Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.

Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 "BP Burger" up against any burger in this town and say simply - "beat that!"

Can't wait to try what's next.

Hate to say it, but Free Vegas Club Passes didn't exactly deliver as I had hoped during my girls weekend in Vegas. Now, we did plan our trip during one of the busiest weekends of the year, Labor Day weekend. That said, I booked my schedule more than a month in advance on Chris' website. Since you are required to party at the Palms on the first night, I signed us up for Rain and Moon for Friday. I also selected Tryst for Saturday and XS for Sunday. I knew that these clubs were among the most popular but they were listed as options at the time and I received a confirmation shortly after submitting my request. 

The confirmation did state that the info might change but I didn't hear anything in the following days that would indicate that it had. One week before the trip, I received emails that said the lists for Tryst and XS had been canceled, and we were now on a list for Cathouse at the Luxor for both of those nights. I appreciated the back-up plan, but we already had our hearts set on the other clubs, not to mention dinner reservations at the Wynn for Saturday night since we thought it was where we were going to party later in the evening.

Since there was no way in hell I was going to let my girls down, I quickly contacted another friend who was going on the trip to explain the situation. She worked her own contacts and got us on VIP lists for Tryst and XS on the same nights we originally wanted. 

We did stick with our Friday night plans regardless and went to Rain since DJ Pauly D was spinning. It was a GREAT time.

So will I use the service again or recommend it to friends? Perhaps. Probably. On non-holiday weekends, it's probably a great service. But I'd definitely be wary that things may not work out, so I'd probably come up with my own back-up plan just in case.

Another 4 star Ramen spot in Vegas.  I'm really enjoying hitting up the various one's on every trip out to sin city.  This time it was meeting up with great friends from high school in Japan for a much needed girls weekend.  Being that we grew up eating ramen picking it for lunch was a easy choice.

Ramen Sora serves up all broth type ramen froms shio, shoyu, tonkotsu and miso.  They state they serve Sapporo Ramen which is miso based.  It is def one of my fave broth flavor that I grew up eating in Japan including the instant kind by sapporo ichiban!  Obviously the toppings at each ramen house varies but typically a bowl of miso ramen is served with chashu, bean sprouts and corn.  

Deluxe Sora Ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#hCJU9RRGp3DKxDTlDB3YSA  You get to pick the broth choice and I decided to go with miso.  The bowl came out nice and hot.  Broth had a great flavor not salty as some can be.  Good ajitama. The chashu was nice and fatty and soft.  It was sliced on the thinner side but it was very good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#D-VllyZqgYKzpRSSEh7PBw The noodles were the yellow curly chijiri type.  It was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  They offer 2 bowl sizes (regular and large) and additional toppings are offered for a reasonable price.  

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#eaaQo6H7y5Ob4t3j7ydoeg Fried up with a decent char.  The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio. 

Ramen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.  Depending on the time you get there you will def have a wait as we did albeit a short one.  

Eyes ~ Nice bowl of noodle goodness!
Nose ~ Smells so good!.
Ear ~ Happy chatting and eating.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

Okay... Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.

Pho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.

When I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.

During my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more "true" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.

However, here's the issue:

NOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.

So...... basically......

Eat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars.

Hello Katsu if you are reading this, this is Lt. Col. Nakamura's son. I met you in front of the Japanese Specialties store. I just want to thank you for all your hard work, and congratulations on opening up your restaurant. I know you have only been open for a few days but every Japanese person I know already thinks you have the best Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas. I also want to add that you have the very very best Tan Tan Men I have ever had in my life. It is even better than the Tan Tan Men at the world famous Chin-Ma-Ya. 

Sorry to Yoshi and my friends at Ramen Sora, but FUKUMIMI has officially taken the top spot on my "Best Ramen in Las Vegas" list. The bowl of Tan Tan Men I had here the other day was not just the best Tan Tan Men, but it was the very best bowl of Ramen I have ever had. Way better than anything you would find at one of the MON restaurants. FUKUMIMI is also the only Japanese restaurant in all of Las Vegas that has a bowl of Tan Tan Men that leans more on the Japanese spectrum. The Tan Tan Men at Shuseki is more of the Chinese variation, which is also really good but not exactly what I am looking for. Katsu who is the owner and chef at FUKUMIMI has put in years of experimenting to get the exact perfect balance of spice and sweetness for his Tan Tan.  Not to mention, the texture and thickness of the broth was almost like curry, and the big pieces of bok choy just made an already perfect bowl of Ramen even more perfect. 

FUKUMIMI is practically a one man operation. The owner is also the lead chef, and he makes sure that every little thing is absolutely perfect down to the smallest detail.  You know a restaurant is going to be good when the chef who created the recipes is also the one cooking for you. And, just to let you guys know,  FUKUMIMI is NOT a multi-million dollar bankrolled Ramen-Ya like Monta.  FUKUMIMI is the underdog now, but I predict in a couple of months they will have way more business than the other Ramen-Ya's here in Vegas because every Japanese person will tell you that the best Ramen comes from small family operated restaurants, not some big chain ala Santouka. 

I also want to thank the staff at FUKUMIMI for being so hospitable to my Korean Mother who told me that the inhouse-made Kim-uchi was way better than Korean Kimchi. She and her other Korean friends loved it.

I really encourage all the Japanese-Americans here in LV and Henderson to come support this business.

5-stars and my favorite Ramen-Ya in Vegas, and my 2nd favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas(right behind Shogo's Sushi on Rainbow).

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it in dew
Cover it in chocolate 
and a miracle or two?

Smeeks!

Let me get this out of the way. There are two things that Smeeks is missing: A bike rack and Sammy Davis Jr.  The first should really be unforgiveable, especially for a hipster, indie, shopping mecca such as this corner is, but I will distribute blame to all of the shops and take in to consideration that they let me park my bike inside for a recent writing workshop I attended there and let it slide this once. As for item number two...well since he died of throat cancer in 1990 we will let that one go as well.

I went for a writing workshop after hours, last night. The workshop was based on writing about memories and they had a table loaded with chocolates, gummies, malt balls, candy cigarettes, button candy, any kind of treat to spur sweet memories so I had a chance to sample a wide variety of goods.

I have also been in to Smeeks several times on my own so this review is by no means based solely on a candy catered, one-night, sugar-rush.

Smeeks is adorable, it's charming, it's old-school but not geriatric. If personified it would be that fun yet classy older lady who you are surprised to find yourself fantasizing about.

My sweet tooth took over last night; it became Hyde to my dieting Jekyll, but "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." so I gave in to temptation. I let my fingers gently grip ball after ball of smooth, thick chocolate covering the light crunch of malt. I tongued the candy cigarettes and let one dangle from my mouth doing my best James Dean pout. I sucked the chocolate from chocolate covered marshmallows followed by the sensation of the sugary delight disolving in my mouth. I was a kid in a candy store.

Smeeks is full of the hard to find. Each member of the group last night and each person i have ever entered the store with has found a candy that made them light up with recognition as they  rattled on about whatever childhood memory it had spurred, despite the fact I have never heard of most of them.

Let us not forget the novelties. Small toys, trinkets and a wall of bacon products. Not flavored, more of a wall for the worshipers of bacon. i wallet made to look like it is made from bacon, bacon magnets, notepads, bacon everything.

Based on early reviews it sounds like Smeeks got a rough start, but as Yelpers we have to love a place that does it right; a place that takes the issues of the people and listens then in turn improving until they are the 5 star establishment that they are today.

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

My girls are the shit. They dragged me out and promised a night that I won't forget - but I almost forgot because of the bottle service!

Upon arrival for the midnight showing, our host walked us right in and dropped us off at the bar so we could get drinks while they got our table ready. I ordered the Washington Apple which consisted of: Pendleton 12 year Canadian Whiskey, Cranberry Compote, Lemon, and Apple Bitters. Delicious!

About 15 minutes passed and we were escorted to our table located in front to the left of the stage, but we ended up being front and center after they moved us :) Our server was friendly, fun and kept checking up on us throughout the night. Open the top of the ottomans to stash your purses, wallets, and phones here. The bouncers are geat at keeping an eye on your things and we always had people sitting at the table to make sure.

Now for the show.. I'm positive there are going to be those who haven't seen it reading the reviews so I won't go into detail, but these are a few acts to keep an eye out for: Prescott (super hot and an amazing beat boxing woman), Pandora (HOLY MOLY! Keep an eye out for her!), The Girl Who Plays with Fire, table tapping, and some lap dancing fun ;) There are maaaany more acts that will keep you enveloped with the highly inappropriate (love it!) show the whole time since there's always something going on!

The last act of the show helps transition Rose. Rabbit. Lie. into a "night club." The majority of the audience got out of their seats and went to the dance floor to have some fun. A few of the performers even came out to mingle with the crowd and danced with us (love you Frog Man). The stage keeps rotating to reveal the DJ, some fun with bubbles, and more performers doing various things. After half an hour, they did clear out the middle of the dance floor for a fun little cirque du doleil act. Then it was dancing time again! Since our table was right there in front, we got to both people watch while hanging out and step out onto the dance floor when we wanted to. I forgot how good it felt to just.. DANCE!

Remember that a little party never killed nobody ;)

Overall, my experiences with Vosges have been good.  I've had one of the best milkshakes I could remember there--distinct taste, hand scooped ice cream, refreshing.  I have also had the good fortune to get some of their chocolate truffles as a gift, which were great.  Their truffles were a lot like their milkshakes--they tasted good, but the flavors were also distinct and unique (not just rich, chocolately and heavy like many--though not all--of the truffles you will find at Godiva).

On my last trip, I ordered one of their milkshakes (the Wattleseed--kind of a nutty vanilla) and while the taste was very good, it was way too thin.  It was more like drinking cold milk than a milkshake.  For the price, the portion size was not that big.  This was made worse by the fact that they used so little ice cream in the milkshake.  Since this milkshake was so thin and not that big, I drank it quicker than probably any milkshake I've ever had.

Vosges is definitely not cheap, but the quality is good and the flavors are distinct and sophisticated.  I'm not one to send stuff back, but given that the service is good, they would have probably re-did the milkshake if I had requested.  I will still return to Vosges on my next Vegas visit, but I hope my milkshake will be better.

I will also have to splurge and take home some of those good chocolates.

Vosges is also known for their expensive, gourmet candy bars, which you can also find at Bristol Farms or Cost Plus World Market.

After getting an ad in the paper for Lowe's I decided to stop by and check out the deals they were advertising. 

The store was clean. I checked prices on a couple work supplies I usually get at a different home improvement store in town but Lowe's prices were slightly higher. I grow a vegetable garden every year and wanted to check out the garden department. I was glad did! They have this nifty plastic rolling basket that has a handle you can pull up to pull along if you don't want to carry the basket. The rolling basket is also nice and deep to carry your plants. They have a nice variety of flowers and they were priced good. They had a nice variety of veggie plants that looked very healthy and had good structure. I never understand why some nurseries put out weak and frail plants so late in the season so it was nice to see these ones all healthy. 

I'm a girl so of course my review about this Lowe's is mostly about gardening and kitchen appliances! They have all your general home improvement needs as well it is just a matter of price checking to see which home improvement store at the time has the best deals. They have truck and tool rental as well. Lowe's does offer the higher end kitchen appliances but not at the best prices when it comes to the smaller kitchen appliances like blenders, mixers, processors etc. The smaller stuff can easily be found much cheaper at a variety of places. The bigger appliances like washers, dryers, & vacuums however are priced better then say Best Buy would usually offer. There were enough things I did like about my experience to come back so that I will!

I like the Monte Carlo. It's usually cheaper than the surrounding hotels and the staff have always been super friendly.

Now, it's not the Bellagio- but it's definitely not the Circus Circus. You can get a good Vegas experience in the heart of the strip without breaking the bank. I also like that it's walking distance from the other hotels, so hopping from place to place isn't an issue.

The rooms are clean, but again, no-frills. For us, we don't spend too much time in the room, we usually wander around, shop, gamble and eat. We're not the club type, so having one in the hotel is definitely not a priority.

The casino has the usual slots and tables- but it's not my favorite place to gamble. I prefer heading to the old Vegas where minimums are between $2 and $5. If you go during the week here, they have them, but you're usually playing by yourself. I prefer playing with a crowded table- I think it makes it more exciting (for Blackjack at least...)

Valet is sometimes a little bit of a pain- especially around check-out time for hotel guests. We've waited 45-minutes for our car. After being hungover and tired, that is the last thing you want to do. Yes, it's free. But it's much quicker to just park in the structure and do a quick little hike to get out faster.

Now, I haven't tried the restaurants on property- however, it looks like they aren't favored by a lot of Yelpers. I usually stick to the binging of buffets to fulfill my hunger.

Tip: Check the website and Vegas.com frequently as rates can change drastically from one day to the next.

This is more of a rebuttal and a little update to Bautista's K (the owner?) review since I was mentioned in it.
 
----"As for Shirley B. - was very surprised to find this review redundant. As if it was to sabotage a business and give a review only on the 3rd day of "soft opening" -"----

Am I understanding this right? I am being accused of sabotage? I sure hope not.
 I cant take this unwarranted accusation lightly and feel the need to address it.
 
I normally do write ups after a first visit to new places but my review was based after a second visit (2/10) to this place a week and a half later, not on the 3rd day of soft opening (Jan 30) that Bautista K comprehended. .  Go over and reread my review again, 4th paragraph where I mention my 2nd visit.
  
As for redundancy, I cant help that since both visits when I ate there, temperature wise, the food was not hot enough. Which by the way is fact since it was reflected in SNHD inspection a day later coincidentally after my review was written. Update:  I'm happy Bautista's  took proactive steps and corrected it and now rockin the A grade.

For the most part my review was positive as I mention food tasted good, prices reasonable and friendly staff. Some people think I'm way too nice and too generous with the ratings I dish out. Sorry you take the overall review as sabotaging your business but I still stand by my original review.
 
I sure hope the accusation is just a misunderstanding. All who know me know I am a big advocate and supporter for businesses in our community and only want to see everyone succeed.  Even your business here in Vegas Bautista K!  Happy to hear you are doing great with all the new dishes I see you are now offering  and possibly look forward to trying them one of these days.

You're kidding right.  As close to authentic Italian as I am (I'm Asian).  

RANT:  Even in the black chip world of Las Vegas, charging twice as much as anyone else does not mean the food is twice as good.  $22 for a personal Margherita pizza?  $22???  The best example I had in Italy, from a widely acknowledged top pizzeria rated by professional food reviewers, 7 ($9).  And yes, it was more than twice as good.

The menu reads well with dishes from Toscana, Lazio, and Campania.  Ordering done.  Anticipation builds, then WTF, bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar,  Italians would never commit such a culinary faux pas.  The producers of either great ingredient would sooner see it run down the street then mix them together.  Not a good sign.

The springtime Roman classic, fried artichokes.  They should be well trimmed, fried golden brown.  The contrast between the bitter, crispy leaves and sweet tender heart makes the mouth all kinds of happy.  NOT HERE.  Half cooked, inedible leaves around an undercooked heart.  Bitter and vegetal in all the wrong ways.

The pizzas hailing from Nappoli, decent ingredients, properly blistered, crust well seasoned with a decent chew.  So what's wrong?   Rustic is one thing, plain sloppy is another.  Margherita had 90 percent of the cheese on one side of the pizza.  The desiccated, burnt basil on the other.  The prosciutto with asparagus had all of it's ingredients centered in the middle with a two inch wide crust all around.

Finally, the wines.  This is an enotecca right?  So Roman food, no wines from Lazio.  Limited selections from Campania (Nappoli), Tuscany well represented. Vegas resort prices.

Euro contemporary ambiance.  Servers lack energy.  Italy, still half a world away.

This place gets 5 stars for the excellent bar staff. I've been here a few times since opening. My friend absolutely loves this place  like ranting & raving about them... Until this visit I thought they were ok, about 3-4 stars.... But they just secured that final star and I'm so glad I waited to review. 

First my only real complaint from the first few visits was that it was really difficult to find out what kind of meat I was getting on my tacos. I'm allergic to pork, I know, I know The Horror! Anyway, my pork allergy puts me on edge when I don't feel confident the cooks understand what I mean by "I do not want any pork!" 

I had been complaining to my bf that if only they could update the signs to show what kind of meat.... And low and behold they did! Yay! It is was less stressful for me to order and try new things now. 

We decided to sit at the bar, and what a treat! The bar is small so if you ever get the opportunity, I say grab it! The bartender (completely forgot his name - cute young, hipsterish kinda guy) is awesome. He's fun, friendly and very funny. He made me this delicious pumpkin pie shot... Yum! Consider me converted.

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

I've never been to a spa before. I'll do a quick review of the place itself first and then explain my experience for anyone who cares.

All I have to say is that I don't really understand the concept of a spa like this lol but it was still enjoyable.

So basically the place has different rooms to relax in with varying heat levels.

It's $20 for all day admission.

It's all about relaxing and distressing your body in a clean and calm area.

There is a restaurant, a few different Sauna rooms, place to watch tv, and even a place to exercise. There is a fully stocked hygiene type area with shampoo, lotion, and hair products, for getting ready. 

Aside from those amenities you can get massages at an additional cost.

Overall it's super clean. The staff is super nice. And the place is large. 


So if you want a place to go to to just lounge around and relax for a few hours then I'd say to check this place out. 

Okay so here's how it works! I feel like saying this because I had no idea "what to do here" so hopefully this helps those first timers.

There are two floors. The bottom is gender specific and the upstairs is for both.

After you pay you are given a wrist band. This is used to open your locker and also to charge your food or drinks since you pay when you leave.

You enter through a a male or female side, put your shoes away in the shoe locker, then you are at a locker room area. There are TV's and chairs to watch TV away from the women and is where you out your stuff. 

In the men's side there are a bunch of showers. Sitting showers, standing, cold or hot. Then a big "hot tub" type pool and a cold one, and then 4 saunas. There's a dry sauna, two steam saunas, and another dry heat type sauna room. I don't dig saunas so I don't really have an opinion on these.

Oh yea! Everyone is basically nude down here so don't be bashful. I was a bit apprehensive at first but you really have to get over it to enjoy yourself.

Basically the only time you HAVE TO be fully nude is to enter the pools. It's all about hygiene so you shower nude and then get in the poop nude. This was really actually one of the more relaxing things.

Can't say much about the saunas.

Anyways upstairs!

Then upstairs you must wear the little outfit they provide which include shirt, shorts, and sandals.

There's two TV areas, a restaurant that also serves smoothies and teas, an exercise room, the private Massage rooms, a yoga area, and the "saunas. 

The restaurant seems expensive but hey if the food is good who cares. 

The rooms are all different in what material they are made out of and how hot they are. I honestly hate being hot so my favorite parts weren't related to the saunas so much.

The stand out rooms were the ice room and the red clay room.

The red clay room has these small red clay balls that you lay in and also these clear rocks that you can lay in. I preferred the balls and this was our favorite room. The balls felt very therapeutic when you lay on them or stepped on them

The idea is to just lay there and relax but the whole process of getting into a pit with tiny clay balls is really loud.

The second favorite room for me was the ice room. It's a freezing cold room. My cup of tea for the hangover I was having.

You use these sauna rooms for 3-7 minutes, drink some water, and relax for 30 minutes and try out the other rooms. I'm not sure the purpose of each room but basically whatever floats your boat then go to the room!

That's basically it. Idk if I'd go again but it was cool to experience. Maybe if there were different explanations to the rooms and their therapeutic benefits then I'd have been more into it but sitting in hot rooms isn't my thing. 

If you do it the right way there are about 5 of those dry sauna rooms so in 45 minute cycles you could easily spend a few hours here.

Mon Ami Gabi is the kind of French Bistro friend we all wish we knew back in our own hometowns.

For me, the number one draw was the View ... not the view of the Paris Hotel & Casino, but the view from the outdoor patio of the Bellagio Fountains across the Las Vegas Strip. There are two dining options at Mon Ami Gabi: Indoor or Patio. Indoors is going to be a "finer dining experience" and much shorter wait. Even though we had reservations, it took about 20 minutes to get seated on the patio. The wait was worth it. We lucked into a table right in the middle directly across from the Bellagio. If you come after 6:00 p.m. the fountain show is every 15 minutes, so, plan accordingly.

Our meal was $195 for my wife and me. It was a bit over-priced, but still a rewarding couple steaks, drinks, and sides. And did I mention the view? Olivia had the 22 oz Bone-In Rib Eye Steak with Bearnaise Sauce ($40) while I got the Filet Mignon Merlot with Butter & Wine Reduction Sauce ($35). Both steaks were 4-star cuts of meat with the filet tender and the rib eye juicy. They came with the house Frites and we added sides of Asparagus (3-stars) and Mushrooms (3-stars).

I stuck with the house Pinot Noir (Mon Ami Gabi 09 $8 each) before/during dinner while she went with 3 rounds of the Le Fleur cocktail ($13)  which was super sweet thanks to St. Germain and Bacardi Limon. For dessert, we split a Creme Brulee ($8 - 4 stars) and had a Latte. We were in no rush to leave thanks to the Fountains of Bellagio view and relaxed pace of our meal.

Our server was especially bland. I'm sure his job must suck serving tourists all day, every day, but a little enthusiasm or acting like you cared about our experience would of been nice. Oh, who cares. Just bring us another round of drinks.

Anyhoo, come for the view. Enjoy some steaks. Dream of being in Paris. You're on vacation at Mon Ami Gabi.

5 Stars for the intimate Study Bar Alone... the best craft cocktails in Vegas!...yes that's a bold statement...Still, the rest of RRL is on point as well!

rose. rabbit. lie. is the latest happening at The Cosmopolitan.

It is billed as a "rebirth of the social club" and a "grand social experiment."  so, there you go...I'm sure that explains it perfectly.  Essentially what they have done is broken down the walls (some of them anyway) between typically separate venues like a restaurant, club, cocktail bar, and a live entertainment theater and brought them together in one spot.  The club doesn't start until after the last show, the restaurant is semipermeably divided from the entertainment, but the interplay creates a unique experience for sure.  There are several bars in the space as well--including one sensational place for quintessential cocktails...The Study...

The Study...  This niche bar is a small secluded treasure inside of rose. rabbit. lie.  They offer well-crafted, often boozy, but always balanced cocktails.  The Study serves up many classically inspired drinks as well as offering several modern variations.  The staff is staff here is elite and will work off the menu to delightful results as well.  The drinks start around $16 and are worth the price.

Nocturne is the show at RRL.  It is a whimsical interplay of circus acts...wait...or is it side show acts?...you'll have to find your way into the Cloak Room to know for show.  The shows are different at each time slot, but similar in concept.  I found the 8pm & 10pm shows to playfully fun and amusingly cheesy.  The individual acts range from tap dancers to contortionist; tight wire to burlesque; balance acts to aerial ropes.  In the same way that Coldplay is Radiohead Light, Nocturne is Absinthe Light.  Great in it's own right, but falling short to purists of the original.

Let me start by saying I'm not a fan and I doubt I will ever be back to Echo & Rig.  We came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  We were brought our iced tea quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.

I had looked at the menu online and I took some time to decide once there.  For a starter, we ordered their portobello fries which were served with an herb aioli.  This was the first I noticed that anything that stated garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  The herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.

My wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though I suggested she get medium rare and I ordered the hanger steak blue.  She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  Garlic fail number 2.  All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.

The portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  Then we waited.  We saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  Approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  He took our small plates and silver away.  About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  About 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  This time, he was right.

When the steaks arrived, I noticed that both had been cut in slices and I just cringed.  I absolutely hate it when this is done.  Maybe that's why so FEW places do it.  I asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  When he came back he told us that the chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  My steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than I would do it at home.  My wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew that you wouldn't expect.  She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  But above all, I'd say, please don't cut my steak.  I'm not a two year old and I'm not infirm.  I Googled this when I got home and found that the only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.

We each had a sundae for dessert.  They were OK.

I left Echo & Rig very disappointed.  The length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  It was a Tuesday afternoon--not date night USA at 8 PM.

Pho.  I've missed it since moving to Arizona.  Tragic, I know.  Recently I became fixated on it.  Had to have it.  For a week it was pretty much the only meal I could think about.  Where, oh where to get it in Phoenix?  Lucky for me, I know people.  People who know where to go to feed my need for Pho.  Da Vang!

Right when we walked into Da Vang, I knew it was going to be good.  It just looked, well, like it was supposed to.  A little worn, and more utilitarian than attractive - you know that everyone comes for the food, not the decor.

The menu is pretty extensive - almost overwhelming, and conveniently numbered for people like me who would butcher the pronunciation of the dishes.  I should have taken more time to review, but I was on a mission.  A Pho-king mission and I wasn't leaving without it.

To start, we enjoyed deliciously fresh spring rolls - one type with shrimp (#48) and the other with BBQ pork (#49).  Both were prepared with crisp refreshing mint leaves and went oh so well with the peanut dipping sauce.  Heaven!

The beautiful big bowl of seafood pho (#12) that was placed before me was well worth waiting for.  Oh!  Shrimp, crab, squid and more!  Bathed in a succulent broth and surrounded by a hearty portion of rice-stick (thin) noodles.  Love these!  Seeing my friend's noodle envy, I surrendered a portion to add to his Pho, which came with thicker noodles (and looked awesome, too).  I like the burn, so I heated up my broth with chili sauce, sriracha, lime juice and even a couple jalapeno slices.  After a few bites my lips were on fire - perfect!

My only regret is that there was no way that I could even consider dessert.  Physically impossible after all of the amazing food I had consumed.  I am sure they would have been good.  Well, I just have a reason to go back!

Well worth the drive.  Da Vang, I know where to find you now, and plan on seeing you often!

Buying a Westgate timeshare was the biggest mistake I've ever made. Every other bad choice in my life has at least ended up leading me somewhere better or helped me to become a better person down the road, but not the timeshare. This bad decision sucked a ton of money out of me and continues to do so for maintenance and taxes every year, and I haven't gotten ANYTHING out of it except for years worth of scam artists cold-calling me to get MORE money out of me to supposedly sell it - a scam that probably works a lot with Westgate owners because having this $#@! timeshare is such a MISERABLE experience. EVERY time I have tried to use my timeshare, there has been something new pop out of the woodwork. "Oh sorry, that resort will be an extra $1000 fee because it's ski season." "Oh sorry, that resort, and that one, and that one, and yes, those other ones, are all full." "Oh sorry, there's a new rule at Planet Hollywood now where you have to bank your week by September 30th of the previous year or it's gone until 2014. Yes, we know that Westgate used to allow you to use it in off-years, but we're Hilton now. Tough luck." 

We were promised easy booking, plenty of availability, lots of choices for resorts, a big grand opening party when PH opened... nothing. I've had none of that. The timeshare presentation was smoke and mirrors, and now I own a worthless so-called "vacation" package I have not been able to actually use ONCE in 4 years. And I've been paying over $650 in taxes every year for the privilege of NOT actually going on vacation.

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT let these scam artists suck you in. If only I had read reviews before signing that paper. If only.

Oyster Bar is a no doubt a hidden gem in Las Vegas, from what I heard there's an another location in Harrah's but price is higher and probably more crowded since is in the strip.  One thing I really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location. The casino cigarette smell is very strong and almost unbearable.

Our group came here in a weeknight, there is only two group before us but the waiting was over 30 minutes long.  There are maybe around 20 seating at top of that the cooking expect to take another 20 or 30 minutes.  The bar setting is a kitchen like those in a ramen shop except you can see the whole kitchen.  Food was careful prepare and you see they not rushing make your food and really take their time and not to avoid short cuts.

Pan Roast and some other dish there is a charge of $5 extra per person if the food is been shared, and you cannot do takeout either.  However, you can take back the food if can't finish it.  They gave you dining roll, which are warm and soft.  We only order two item, one is the full serving of Oyster and the second one is the Combo Pan Roast.

The oyster was fresh and mouthwatering, juicy and you can really tasted the flavor.  It was day and night quality compare to the oyster found in Bacchanal Buffet. The Pan Roast was delicious and was well balance in term of the soup; it wasn't heavily tomato flavor, the soup come with lobster, crab, and shrimp.  There was little bit of lobster meat, and decent amount of crab, but the shrimp won me over, it was good quality.  

The price is far cheaper than the Harrah location but with more limited selection.  What it matter is the quality of food is not compromise here.  So if you are tired of eating of buffet, this would gave you a totally different taste bud.  Just aware expect a wait and the atmosphere is not as pleasant.

***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs, making the show feel dramatic, exciting and unique***

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).

Don't really have a lot of experience in courthouses but have to say I'm a fan of Clark County

Per the advice of our wedding chapel, we had pre-filled the Marriage Certificate form online b/c we wanted to avoid potentially huge lines & save our time for wedding day preparations

BEST TIP:  be sure there are no special characters in your entries or you'll get an error message that won't tell you why it won't process.... I tried entering # and a comma or two, for example & it didn't like that.....remember letters or numbers only & you'll be fine

But other than that - probably took all of 5 min to fill out & had I not been held up w/ the special character issue, would have been less

ALSO:  Bring your $60 CASH b/c who wants to pay a pesky credit card usage fee??

We got there right at 8am when they opened & there were already people ahead of us but we only waited like 5 min - and there were about 4 more couples who entered right after we did

It was fun seeing each of the couples & imagining them together for life & the very reason they were there was the same reason as we were there

The people who processed us were all business but hey - it's a government job just like any other & we were happy & joking around enough for the group of us

So a huge 5 stars for speeding up the process by offering online options, for the quick turnaround in the office & for making the ordering process a breeze.  And the final icing on the wedding cake was that we got our Certified Marriage License well before their 10 day turnaround expectation.....so THANKS for exceeding my expectations!

The air is thick in this hotel.  I'm not talking about smoke.
You walk in and the warm, rich wood everywhere make you feel comfortable right away, but there is a feeling in the air.
It is a familiar feeling, even though you may have never been here before.
It's the feeling of nostalgia. 
It's the feeling of class.
It's the feeling of old Vegas.
...and it's really my style of place.

The building has been here since before just about anything else in Vegas -- 1906, so the strange familiarity and comfort start a creative soul to fantasize of sordid misadventures held here in a past life, perhaps a roaring 20's soiree or a post-WWII survival celebration.

The rooms themselves, although remodeled with modern conveniences like LG LCD tv and iPod doc alarm clock, are still thick enough with that ether-substance of the psyche of more than a century of guests that one can forget about the present time and get swank with the ghosts in the room.  (Sadly, I never saw any real ghosts)

Crank open the lock on the windows and actually open them up to let the 'fresh' downtonwn air into your room!

Check out the hand-tiled bathroom and instantly transport yourself to your gramma's tourqoise powder room to draw yourself a bath from separate hot and cold cross-handled faucet turns.

As long as you're coming alone or as a couple, and not trying to share a room with 3-4+ people, the only real drawback I can see is that if you're a person of large mass or width, there may be a tight squeeze in that bathtub or even on the toilet, with your arm pressing up against the wall.

There was a bit of the Freemont Music coming in the room, but that doesn't go forever, and wasn't an issue at all.  A request for a room on the opposite side of the building helps a lot.

For a ton of class, nostalgia, convenience, and value, Golden Gate in downtown Vegas is going to be tough to beat, and I'm surely going back again.  Maybe someday if I'm ever a homeless ghost, this would be my ideal place to squat.  I could make sure no one else was disappointed by not seeing ghosts here!

Just happened to stumble into this place for one of their lunch buffets. There seemed to be a buzz about a new name and menu and the inside looked different than before.

Arrived right when they opened and did a head dive straight for the buffet. They had a nice medium sized selection of items with several options for those who do not eat meat. Really liked the freshly cooked Garlic Naan bread that they brought to the table. It was delicious and a great way to sop up the sauces.

The best part of the buffet is that you can eat as much as you want. I went up a few times and was completely full by plate number three. The Tandoori Chicken was very good and ended up eating an equivalency of a buckets worth at KFC.

Everything else was very tasty and with just the right amount of heat for the common folk. I doctored mine up with some of the spicy peppers and hot sauces to get it that extra kick in the pants.

Service was very pleasant and the place was comfortable and clean. Just make sure that you are watching your feet as you approach and leave the buffet table. The level of the floor changes quickly in one spot and can create a party foul.

Bring the family and the kids. The value of food per square inch makes this a great deal. Plus it is pretty fast to get into and out of in a hurry and back to work. ALL YOU CAN EAT HAPPY!

How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?

I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?

And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.

Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.

The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Why don't they allow us to give negative star reviews?

My 5 YO loves this place.  It's close to home and the price is very decent.

Today, he had no school so my parents (his grandparents) took him to Jambo and spent most of the day there.  At one point, my son was thirsty and had gone to the counter to ask for a cup for water.  The person at the counter was very kind and got a water cup for him, put ice in it and for whatever reason, put orange soda in there for him instead of water.  That was nice.   

My son went to sit down in the sitting area and proceeded to drink out of his cup.  A man (who claims is the manager) stormed up to my son, GRABBED his arm and demanded to know why there was soda in there since those cups were specific for water only.  He continued to snatch the cup out of my sons hand and threw it in the trash can and huffed and puffed away.  My mother, upon seeing this went straight to him and asked him what was going on.  The "manager" exclaimed that those cups were specifically for water and why would my mom try to sneak in soda for free?  My mother tried to explain to him that it wasn't her and that it was one of the employees that did it.  He demanded that my mom tell him who it was because he was going to fire him on the spot for doing that.  My mom refused to tell him because she didn't want him to get fired over pouring a measly ounce of soda in to a cup. The "manager" continued to berate my mom for "stealing" soda and told her to go to McDonald's next time because their soda was cheaper there.  

I am absolutely FLOORED by this and could not believe that someone is THAT miserable with their job that they would man-handle my son and throw a drink cup away and claim to fire someone over giving an innocent 5 YO a small plastic cup with soda.  You can bet I will NEVER come here again and you can believe that this story will be on REPEAT to ANYONE and EVERYONE that I know.  I'll also be making a trip to Jambo to confront this alleged manager.

This Vietnamese restaurant is one of my frequent stops in the area. I first discovered this place on Yelp, and since then have tried a variety of items on the menu. The squared-shaped interior is largely dependent on natural lighting. The horizontal layout includes TVs, rows of tables, and a small kitchen in the back. 

For appetizers, I recommend the Goi Guon ($3.95). The spring rolls come with grilled pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli, and peanut sauce. The ingredients were fresh, ranging from the rice wrapper to the contrasting tastes and textures embedded in the middle. For this dish, I often ask for fish sauce on the side. It's a good opener for those who wanted something to hold them over until the main entree. 

The menu consists of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, but I come here largely for their signature item: Banh Cuon. To me, this is one of the best Banh Cuon I've tasted so far due to the stuffed minced pork and soft fluffy rice crepes. Among the options, I recommend the Banh Cuon Cha Lua ($8.95) that comes with slices of Vietnamese ham, chopped red leaf lettuce, basil, herbs, pickles and fish sauce. I also suggest the Banh Cuon Chao Tom ($9.25) that comes with soft golden fried fish cakes. The combination of fresh and fluffy textures, perfect thickness on the rice crepe, delicious toppings, and fish sauce made this particular menu item a must try for first time goers. 

Their Pho ranges from $7.95-$8.95 per bowl. The lack of depth in the mild-flavored broth was a consistent pattern from each of my visits. Even though the broth couldn't stand on its own, I find ordering those that come with more than one meat item such as Pho Tai Nam Gan ($7.95) and Pho Tai Sach Bo Vien ($7.95) an effective method to circumvent the problem. Their pho also comes cilantro, yellow onions, scallions, bean sprouts, basil jalapeno and lime. The side of veggies is always fresh. I only wished the broth could offer more depth and complexity, especially given the high price they charge on these dishes.

The Bun Thit Gio thit Nuong ($8.95) came with great textures ranging from the grilled pork, bouncy noodles, and fresh veggies. I really enjoyed this dish, but again the prices are simply too high for me to rate this place higher.

Lastly, their Thai Tea with Boba ($3.50) was too sweet with boba that was old and staled. I don't recommend it.

Service was prompt but limited to the extent of taking your order, bringing food to the table, and the bill at the end. Given the strengths and limitations of this place, I'd be very strategic in ordering items that are associated with rice noodle crepes, vermicelli, and quite possibly, the noodle sticks. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Banh Hoi items.

Came in on a Wednesday night and sat inside, part eatery and Sports bar. I liked how each booth had a flat screen but there were flat screens and sofas if you just wanted to relax as if you're at home!

I opted for a booth but had great views of the entire place for decent people watching. I started off with a cold green tea which was flavorless. My waitress who was there physically but mentally absent took my order for BBQ wings , onion rings and the  B.U.B burger. I specifically requested the wings first and others to follow later but within minutes after the wings arrived the other two items appeared. When the waitress returned and I advised her what happened and her reply was the kitchen was caught up!  The food was decent but I was pleased mostly with the wings. The onion rings were too large, under cooked and a few had too much batter. The burger which contained two large slices of beef, bacon bits and contained another slice of bread which I removed. The burger was overcooked and on the dry side. I was ready to order peanut butter ice cream but the absent minded waitress didn't even bother asking if I wanted dessert and just left me my tab. It's ashame an establishment put this much time and money into this business and yet they have such a sad and unmotivated employee interacting directly with clients. I made sure I tipped accordingly which I thought was still generous.

Compared to my first experience outside at the Umami Beer Garden, this was a horrible experience. Such a disappointing dining experience. If I ever returned here, I will make sure and request not to be seated in the area of this waitress!

I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a "Heart Shaped Pizza" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added "Cheesy Bread" and "Cookie Dough" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.

I've stayed downtown in Vegas a few times, trying out different hotels each time. And each time I'm left feeling like I probably caught a head full of lice from the bedding that hasn't changed since 1986. The Golden Nugget was so fantastically different though. 

I'd always avoided it before, because I figured if I was going to pay $200 for a room I may as well stay on the strip. But they've since lowered their prices to $99, and I must say, it's quite a bargain.

You know those Westin Heavenly beds? These beds went above and beyond those, so much so that I ended up having the most boring Saturday night ever in Vegas. At midnight I cuddled up with the super soft & fresh bedding and the perfect mattress. Pathetic, I know, but Friday night made up for it.

The casino is pretty much the same as any casino to me, just with slightly higher limits than the rest of the casinos downtown. The pool, however really surprised me. I had no idea something like that existed in this part of Vegas. You can even swim with the fishes (so to speak) in Mandalay Bay.

Thumbs Up:
-Freakin' awesome pool area.
-The beds. We were actually trying to devise a way to bring one home with us.

Thumbs Down:
-No vending machines on the floors. What's that all about? I need my M&M's and Mountain Dew when I'm drunkenly stumbling back to my room!

While in the area, hubby and I decided to stop here for lunch. They have a drive-thru and chairs/tables outside. Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. 

The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with "Fried Mozzarella" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the "Garlic Romano Fries" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of "The L.A. Pastrami" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!

I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.

Kuro ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.

Shoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.

Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. 

Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!
Nose ~ Smells good!.
Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!
Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!
Tummy ~ Satisfied.

***Many Las Vegas restaurants let their quality standards slip once they have been around for a while and that is the case with Hubert Keller's Burger Bar; Burger Bar is still a decent value compared to the many overpriced high-end restaurants on The Strip, but there are several new gourmet burger spots in Vegas (like Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood) that are probably more exciting***

There are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.

This Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.

In addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.

I went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.

I also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).

Service was good--pleasant and quick.

Prices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.

I remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.

Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking.

They've been sending out coupons in the mail for a couple of weeks now so I got a takeout order.  The deal was BOGO meat platter with the purchase of 2 large drinks.  

The place was pretty dead on a Wednesday night as I only saw 2 customers dining at 7pm.  I got a rib plate and a 3 meat combo.  Both came with 2 sides each, a roll and pickles and onions.

My 3 meats were pulled pork, beef brisket and turkey.  All of them were good with the brisket being best.  There have been a lot of complaints about the brisket in several reviews being cold or dry.  The lady in front of me ordered a pound of brisket but let it be known she worked for a well known publication in town and spoke with the manager on duty as well.  I think they brought out the most recently cooked brisket because of this.  Maybe everyone should do this to ensure the best quality meat?

The ribs sucked big time.  I am not sure if it was the quality of the meat, the preparation or all of the above but they were very disappointing.  I won't be ordering these again.  They advertise them as "fall off the bone" and it was anything but that.  Stay on the bone ribs?  

I also saw that Nadine K just posted a picture of her ribs from this location and mine did NOT look like that at all.  Her ribs look much better.  Maybe she works for Time magazine?  I would also avoid the green beans with bacon side since that was a watery mess with not so fresh beans.  

I know I'll be back from time to time as long as they keep sending coupons but it's only because it's quick and near my home.

Found out through Shannon E. The Fractured Prune's Grand Opening was today, and wasted no time hustling over on my break! 

Apparently, some other guy didn't either: "I drove all the way out here from Apache Junction for a dozen!" 

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by Marilyn. She talked me through their custom donut process: Selecting a custom glaze and toppings before handing off your card to a doughnut designer.

Think combinations like Dreamsicle, Chocolate Covered Cherry, Maple Bacon. 

Decided on two Mint Chocolate Chip doughnuts: One for me to scarf down at work, one for Andrew C for later. 

Because he might murder me later for going alone. 

And I'm not a self-centered, lameface lady friend. Doing "Nice things" goes both ways, ladies. 

These donuts aren't sitting around in a case, either. Custom means made when you order. 

Got back to work and took a bite. Still piping hot, minty, chocolatey, practically melting in my mouth as I ate it. 

This is really a four star review masquerading as a five star: I love the custom concept; however, I'm more of a "classic doughnut" gal: Think Old Fashioned Kruller with some chocolate on it. 

The customer service is what bumped the rating up to five stars! 

Now go, take a doughnut break. Meanwhile, I'll resist inhaling Dude's while waiting for him to pick it up!

That was too easy! I've only lived in Vegas for about a day now but I feel like I've already found the best grooming place in town thanks to Yelp. Not to mention, the best groomer I've had in any of the amazing cities I've lived in. I'm so impressed with how clean and fluffy they got my beloved Blondie. I'm not gonna lie... she was looking a bit rough around the edges. We both were actually. None of us had the time for our usual girlie maintenance like we normally do because we were both smack dab in the middle of moving. I'm sure you know how that goes. However, there are neighbors to meet, places to go, things to do. We needed to get it together. So I looked on Yelp to find a good place and I made an appointment for both of us to go get beautified. Myself at Spa Mio, Blondie at Yuppie Puppies.

I'm pleased to say that Yuppie Puppies transformed my disheveled Maltese into straight "Show Dog" status. Blondie has horrible tear stains and I was having trouble finding groomers in NYC locally that were able to clean that area up and do a really good job consistently. I'm thrilled that Yuppie Puppies was able to get Blondie cleaner than I've seen her in a long time. I was blown away! As you can see from all of the photos I've uploaded, her tear stains have improved under Brooke's grooming. I'm very appreciative of the quality of service I received there and they have more than earned my regular business. Their 5 star reviews are indeed reflective of the excellent job that they do. I shall return.

Did you know the north central Phoenix community of Sunnyslope includes the first subdivision built in the Phoenix area and has existed since before Arizona was a state?

Originally settled by poor tuberculants who spent their last dime traveling to a drier climate, Sunnyslope was filled with tents and cottages with porches. In 1911, retired architect W.R. Norton (who had already been living in the area for four years) planned a subdivision and named it "Sunnyslope" inspired by his daughter's remark, "What a pretty sunny slope!" after seeing the morning sun on North Mountain.  

By the 1920s, Sunnyslope had grown into a small yet diverse community of prospectors, homesteaders, writers and musicians, among others. Today, the population tops 51,000 and is still very diverse, representing various gifts, ethnicities and socio-economic groups.

Perhaps the most notable quality about Sunnyslope is the community's strong sense of independence, characteristic of its unique sense of place. Residents tried several times to incorporate, finally relenting in 1959 and allowing the community to be annexed by the City of Phoenix. Still, despite being located in the middle of a large metropolitan area, Sunnyslope maintains a unique, small town atmosphere with an active and engaged resident base.

Besides its cool history, other unique elements of Sunnyslope include:
* One of the few places in Phoenix where in-fill development opportunities exist.
* Diverse housing stock and elevation - from living room windows you can see downtown.
* Lots of outdoor amenities: Murphy's Bridle Path, the canal, North Mountain preserve and more than five city parks.
* 9 public art installations.
* Easy access to downtown Phoenix.
* John C. Lincoln Hospital, the community's largest employer, acts as convener for community meetings and events such as a community policing meeting, the Sunnyslope Fall Festival and the Sunnyslope Art Walk.
* Sunnyslope Village Alliance hosts regular meetings with elected officials representing the community. All are open to the public and there is no cost to attend.
* Sunnyslope Historical Society is housed in what was once the People's Pharmacy building. This building's claim to fame is that is was the first drive-thru window west of the Mississippi.
* Authentic Mexican food representing regions including: Oaxaca, Mexico City and Sonora.
* The best patio in Phoenix (Bomberos Caf & Wine Bar). 
* A free neighborhood circulator where you just wave down a shuttle and it will stop (plus there's a transit station for the city bus). Light rail plans to stretch to 19th Ave. & Dunlap which will be a bonus!

While Sunnyslope did experience a period of decline, a result of older housing stock and poorly maintained rental properties, people who have called this place home have remained vigilant in advocating for their neighborhood and care about their neighbors.  Sunnyslope is experiencing a renaissance and is getting more attention for its best qualities; but, truly, if you ask anyone who lives here they'll probably tell you the very best thing about Sunnyslope is the people!

I finally had dinner here after staying at the Venetian several times.  My friend and I ordered the escargots a la bourguignonne ($17.50 - red wine braised Burgundy snails w/ garlic butter & Bouchon pastry puff pastry);  petite plateau ($65 - a seafood tower w/ a 1/2 lobster, 8 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams and 8 mussels; gigot d'Agneau ($33.95 - roasted leg of lamb w/ wilted cavolo nero, garden rhubarb, nicoise olives, crispy panisse and lamb jus); and saumon poele ($36.50 - sauteed Scottish salmon ministra w/ manila clams, salsify, oyster mushrooms and young artichokes - not pictured).

The escargots were the best ones I have ever had.  In most restaurants the garlic and butter overpower the snails.  Not in this case.  The snails were large, uber fresh, super tender and their was just enough sauce to flavor the snails:  5 Stars.  The seafood tower was also excellent.  The seafood was uber fresh and the star of the tower was the oysters and clams.  The brininess of the ocean where each oyster came from stood out:  5 Stars.  Our entrees were very good.  The gigot d'Agneau was very well thought out by chef Thomas Keller.  The lamb was medium rare and the combination of sweetness of the cavolo nero (an Italian kale), and the tartness of the olives went well w/ the strong flavor of the lamb.  The crispness of the panisse (a chickpea flourcake) also contrasted nicely.  I did not snap a pic of my friend's salmon but he said it was very good also.

To accompany the meal we ordered a 1/2 bottle of Louis Jadot Beaune Theurons Pinot Noir ($50).  My friend is a wine connoisseur and he never steers us wrong.  The wine was excellent and the winery is one of the renowned ones in this region in France that produces light, fruity wines that go well w/ meat, seafood and cheese:  5 Stars.

The only downside to the meal was the service was spotty.  We arrived early and we went to have drinks in the bar.  We didn't see a waiter so I went to the bar.  There were two bartenders and one managerial type.  It took a while for one of the two bartenders to notice me.  In addition, when I asked to charge it to my room, the bartender said I had to fill out some slip - WTF?!?!?!  When I checked in the person said I could use my keycard to pay for meals, et al.  I ended up using my credit card.  Secondarily, when we were seated the hostess tried to put us in a table for two next to a post.  The seat next to the post did not have much hip room.  My friend and I are both 6'2" and 225+.  We asked to be seated at a table for four and the hostess displayed a bit of displeasure.  Come on girl!!!  It was not that busy and we were going to drop $300 - We deserved a large enough table to hold our Petite Plateau!!!  Lastly, the shrimp were not peeled and the lobster was not cracked.  We understood the foregoing because the chef wants to demonstrate the freshness of the seafood.  However, when we mentioned it to the waiter, all he did was apologize vs offering a solution.  I said OK, and ate the lobster head like a "Hombre de Cavernas", much to the chagrin of some clients.  F*ck em!!!  I wanted to get all the meat out:  2 Stars on service.

The ambiance is excellent.  There is a fresh seafood bar on your left when you walk in.  The bar is also very nice with a large clock in background.  Lastly, the restaurant reminds you of Bistro in Paris:  5 Stars.

I will definitely come back to Bouchon when I am in Vegas.  I always stay at the V, so Bouchon is easy to find on the 10th floor.

WHO: To all of you Korean food wrapped in tortilla goodness lovers!

WHEN: I'm not too sure when they open, but I do know they close at 9pm.

WHERE: North Decatur, sooooo far but soooo good! =/

WHAT: It all began one night at about 8pm. My friend and I were thinking of a new food place to try. This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lol

When we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...

-The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good
-Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!

We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP. Like NOW!!

I stopped here over a week ago but it was before the business was open for the day so I knew where to go and what time.

I stopped in yesterday and bought two chicken pot pies--one with cheddar crust and one with habanero cheddar crust.  They were in individual boxes and the boxes were not marked so we had to guess which was which.  I din't learn this until I got home.  

They gave me a sheet with baking instructions that were very accurate.  I baked mine a little longer than they suggested but I wanted a nicely browned crust. 

After baking, I turned the pot pies over onto plates and a bit stuck to the bottom which is what I expected.  I have made my own and I know this happens.

The filling of the pot pies was good.  You can tell the freshness by the carrots alone.  When I bit into the carrot slices, I could taste the fresh taste of carrot that hasn't been frozen but is a fresh produce item.

A couple of things about my experience.  I wish I had noticed the lack of marking crust flavors on the box before I got home.  That being said, my wife and I found almost no difference in taste between the two.  The habanero just was not evident.  I also find that chicken is the only option and your flavors are determined by the crust, the chance for different tastes is very limited.  What I'd really like is a curry chicken pot pie.  That you could taste and it wouldn't be that much extra to do.

The pot pies were OK.  I know I'm paying for fresh ingredients and they roast their own chickens, but the cost for the size of the pie is high and maybe it has to be.  I won't need their buyers' card for getting a free one after the correct number of purchases.

Tip:  If you're going to Pie Me Over, look on the east side of Rainbow for the Firehouse Subs.  Pie Me Over is in back behind the buildings in the front of 6070 South Rainbow.

The Salt River is awesome, but only if you go prepared.

Yes, there are drunk people there, that's why people float down a river in the desert on a 110 day, so if you can't handle the drunk and rowdies, don't go. 

I don't really understand the dirty water thing people are talking about. It's a flowing river, yes there's some trash here and there, but the water is fine.

This is what you need to know to TUBE LIKE A BOSS. 

Do not bring jewelry/cell phones/money/anything you don't want to lose. Leave that shit in the car. I lost my wedding band the first time I went, the wife cried the whole ride home, and that's just plain annoying...

Bring ONE car key and wear it around your neck, or tie it to the strings on your shorts. double knot that shit.

1) Bring an old bed sheet, wrap it around your tube and tie it tight underneath. It turns your tube from an ordinary piece of rubber, to a luxurious floating la-z-boy.

2) straps or rope. you're going to want to get your tubes tied (hehe) together so you can hang with your people. There's nothing lamer than being the random solo floater, and everyone asking you where your friends are, you'll look like a jackass. Also, your gonna want to tie your cooler tube to your tube, so you can have food/water/beer close by.

3) get a tube for your cooler, because it's smart.

4) for every beer/alcoholic beverage you bring, bring the equivalent in water. You don't want to be that drunk asshole passed out face down on the beach, with your drunk friends standing around you not knowing what to do. Or maybe you WANT to be that drunk asshole, if so, just bring your 2 liter of Coke and that bottle of Captain's... and let me know how that turns out for you!

5) Wear an old pair of sneakers that you don't mind ruining. The river is swift and the rocks can be sharp, don't mess with flip-flops, wear goddamn sneakers. you'll thank me.

6) Wear a shit ton of sunscreen, especially on your knees/shins, cuz that's what'll be in direct sunlight the whole time. I wear a long sleeve shirt when I go, because i'm old. 

7) hat and sunglasses, again, something you won't mind losing, cuz when you and Sally decide to get rowdy and splash each other, it's gonna turn into a full on "pull everyone off their tubes, it's so funny!" party, and shit's gonna fall off your body.

8) bring pre-packaged food that won't get gross and soggy if water get's in your cooler. I recommend beef-jerky and cheetos, let your white-trash junkfood flag fly!

9) A crappy little radio, because music.

10) Ladies, show your boobs, because it makes the world a better place, and if you run out of beer, you can replenish your supply with this generous act. The river is wild, you must barter to survive.

11) Bonus points if you bring a big bag of marshmallows to throw at people, it's kinda sorta littering, but i'm sure the fish and/or drunk college kids will eat them eventually.

12) To counteract your flinging of marshmallows, if you see trash floating in the water, PLEASE PICK IT UP, and leave the river better that you found it. 

If you follow these easy Salt River Tubing Fun Time steps, you will be on your way to tubing like a BOSS, it's all about comfort people, comfort and boobies. and beer. and boobies. and comfort.

The original plan was to grab a drink since we had dinner reservations later at a place that rhymed with "Sonny Halt".  But the wine and atmosphere was so cool and unVegas plus the menu looked so damn tempting and inviting that we just said screw it and settled in for dinner here. The live music trio they had performing was great and really enhanced the dining.

My favorite dish by far was the lamb shoulder.  It was slow cooked, very tender and the yogurt sauce that accompanied it was perfect.  The risotto was decent.  We weren't that into the grilled cheese.  Even though it was quite different than the average grilled cheese with brie, honey and walnuts, I didn't feel it justified the $7 price.  The 5 onion soup was above average.  Our bartender strongly recommended the cobbler for dessert and it was great.  

There are a lot of other things we definitely want to try that sounded scrumptious like chicken pot pie nuggets and the pork belly flatbread.  The menu they have posted online is dated as there's more to choose from than what's posted.  

I didn't really like how the dining tables were set up.  Neighboring tables were very, very close to one another.  It's as if you were dining with them.  They have the space to open it up a little more.  We chose the bar which was definitely better for couples.  So come as 2 at the bar or 5+ so you can take up a whole table section.  

They also have a happy hour at their wine and cheese bar from 5pm-8pm which includes $2 glasses of wine among other things.  I actually have a reason to go to Tivoli Village now!  Wow!  That only took a year and a half :)

The reason I stay at the MGM Grand is that I'm familiar with it. 
Things I like
Housekeeping is friendly and efficient
Great view of the strip from most rooms 
The Studio Caf for breakfast- Best Lox ever! 
Many really good restaurants 
Maintenance crew responds well.
Photos of yesteryears stars hanging on the walls-Wow did they know how to dress. 

Things I don't like
Horrible water pressure- unfixable
Nasty looking couches in our room
Broken shower handle, so no hot water- until I called for maintenance
Broken hair dryer
Broken lock on our door- until I called for maintenance
No Internet until I called for maintenance 
Requested a King bed, got two queen beds 
Room service doesn't pick up in a timely manner. Wine glasses in hall for 3 days. 
Poor hotel maintenance- Ice cream drips on the beautiful brass elevator doors, never cleaned in the 5 days we were there 
Robot staff at front desk.  
Real Lions on display in a glass enclosure -I get the connection, just don't approve
The rainforest area with all its dusty plastic plants.  
I don't expect cheesiness at a hotel of this caliber 
I also expect to be pampered in a Hotel like the MGM. 
Things seem to be going downhill at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 

But all in all, I had my family with me and that makes everything perfect 
We had a blast playing together. Happy 21ST Birthday Grandaughter 

Now please excuse me I need another nap.  

This one is for you Lydia

(^o^) "Best Free Show In Vegas Hands Down" (^o^)

Bellagio Fountain Show is easily the best free attraction in Las Vegas Strip.  The fountain is a whopping 8-acres manmade lake.  It cost as much as 40 million to build; the fountain created by WET.  I think the fountain has something to do with the cost of the Bellagio high room rate.  The fountain had help Bellagio putting itself above most other 5 stars hotel in the strip.  Vehicles and pedestrians pass by the strip will notice the huge fountain plus its famous water show.

Other the size, the water blast is also remarkable.  It shoots as high as 460 feet, which is over 40 stories high!  At top of that, it got great lighting and music to make a perfect harmony. People of all age would enjoy this fountain, at first it appear this would be a great for romantic setting.  But kids would love this since the water blast is so cool.  

You can great view from the Paris Hotel, few of the outdoor restaurant in Bellagio, and of course the room in the Bellagio themselves. A Las Vegas trip is not completed without a visit to the Fountain Show in Bellagio; I think if they added more recent music would be a nice refresh or color led.  The show run every 15 minutes from 3pm or earlier depend if weekend or holiday is. Which is a good crowd control.

Vegas. Two girls. Hungover. We had a long drive ahead but needed time to collect ourselves. In our dysfunctional state of mind, we decided we wanted brunch.

Off to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper! 

Chicken Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! 

Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.

Banana Nut Muffin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!

Eggs Florentine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!

Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. 

Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =D

CES, the largest convention in the world, features the latest and greatest electronics at the World Trade Center Las Vegas (formerly the Las Vegas Convention Center).....some of the items featured here have not hit the stores yet.  It's one of my favorite conventions to attend here in Vegas.

With over 130,000 people expected at this year's CES I was prepared to battle crowds.  It wasn't too bad though.  I parked at the Las Vegas Hilton, which charges $30 a day to park there, but it's convenient to get in/out, so it's worth it in my opinion.

The registration process was very easy.  There was no line, perfect!

*TIP* - CES has a registration booth at the Las Vegas Hilton and it's not nearly as crowded as the main booth at the World Trade Center.....so come here to register.

I then headed over to the North Hall of the World Trade Center which is where all of the marquee companies are located.  I walked through the automobile electronics section, which was pretty cool.....think high-end and cool car stereo and entertainment stuff.  Then I went into the main hall where companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and other giants are located.  This year 3D TV's and 3D Entertainment seem to be the dominant theme on the main floor.  This really isn't groundbreaking as 3D has been around for a while.....I guess this is the year for the big push for it.  Lack of 3D Content is the big issue for these gadgets.  I also think wearing 3D glasses is ridiculous.....there's technology already out there that doesn't require them....it seems like it's already outdated, but companies are pushing it anyway.  I predict it will be a short term solution.

In the main hall, I also saw the new Samsung tablet...a potential competitor for the iPad.  I wasn't really impressed.  It worked well and looked nice, but not a game changer in my opinion.

After screwing around the main hall for a while, I headed over to the South Hall....I wanted to see the new Blackberry tablet, which is going to be launched soon to compete with the iPad.  I found it on the 2nd floor of the South Hall with a large crowd around the display.  After a short wait, I muscled my way to the front to get a demo of the tablet.....I was pleasantly surprised with the functionality, navigation, speed, and lightweight of the tablet.  The integration with the Blackberry phone is also impressive.  The tablet also has true multi-tasking capabilities....just like a computer, you can watch a video, surf the web, and launch another application with no hiccup in performance.  That was amazing!  In my opinion, it's not a big game-changer, but it puts Blackberry back on the map to compete with Apple and Android.  I like this product and will anxiously wait for it to come out.  I was told Sprint would be the 1st cell carrier to have it.  Can't wait! (see pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ks43LokM7OWst3BJTtt-6g?select=b5ZtjUFv738j0I0Nki8ZQw )

After this, I was tired and wanted to head back to the Hilton to attend the CES Tweetup (different review).

Overall, it was a good show.....well organized and always impressive.

Will I return?  No doubt about it!

Some Tips:

- Wear comfortable shoes.  It's a huge convention and you will do a ton of walking.

- Bring a camera with a lot of memory.  There's a ton of gadgets and things to take photos of.  Don't miss out!

- Be prepared to pay for parking, up to $30 a day.

There is a reason Bobby Flay is an Iron Chef and owner of Mesa Grill and other restaurants... he makes simple food decadently delicious!

We had made brunch reservations one month in advance, as we knew they get booked quickly.

We arrived a little early and were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The decor was inviting and the ambience stylish and warm (see our picture).

Having gotten to know Bobby Flay's personality through watching him on the Food Network, it was pleasantly surprising to see that his staff embodies this warm personality too. 

Our waitress reviewed the menu with us and explained some of Bobby's signature dishes as well as making some recommendations.

While we perused the menu, the flavorful basket of mini cornbreads and assorted small pastries was brought out to our table as were our drinks (Cactus pear iced tea, cofee and Margarita).

Appetizers our party of 4 shared:
*Goat cheese "Queso Fundido" with blue corn tortilla chips - the flavor of the goat cheese dip topped with roasted peppers so full of robust rustic flavor - a solid 5 Stars! 
*Shrimp and sweet corn tamale -Bobby Flay's signature dish. Well balanced flavors, shrimp was cooked to perfection - another 5 star dish. Though the dish comes with 4 large tiger shrimp it would serve as a good appetizer for 2 instead of 4.

Entrees - our waitress let us know how these were going to be cooked and at what temperature to expect them so we wouldn't have any surprises.
*Spicy Scrambled Eggs - served with Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese, Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham and Buttermilk Biscuits - very good flavors.
*Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash served with Poached Eggs & Green Chile Hollandaise - this flavor profile was very delicious 
*Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce
Caramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa & Creamy Green Chile Rice - perfect balance of bright flavors and texture. The Cascabel chile sauce was so good I used the little cornbreads to dip and polish it off my plate!
*New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise & Southwestern Fries - fantastic flavor and the southwestern fries were warm and crispy- not oily at all.

The portions were perfectly sized for brunch but we all agreed we could have eaten more of every dish that we had ordered as every bite was a burst of delicious flavor that tantalized our taste buds.

The service was attentive without being obtrusive. The waitress was knowledgeable and made good recommendations. They have an extensive Margarita menu and the one I had was fantastic.

We added pictures of the food we ordered and I made everyone wait to eat so that I could take some good pictures so make sure to check them out.
 
We will be definitely coming back here to try their other dishes.

The thing about clubs is that they can be hit or miss, depending on what night you go, and what the crowd is like. Fortunately for me and my girls, we went on Sunday night when they place was popping off and we met some really cool people.

First off, the staff is incredibly nice. As we walked up the corridor toward The Bank, we were approached by a promoter who got us to the front of the line (like I've mentioned before, it helps to know the promoters), and then we were greeted by the manager, who was very welcoming. The security guards are some of the sweetest I've ever encountered anywhere. I'm talking about the guys who provide security for the VIP tables on the floor. PRESTON IS THE MAN! Not only did he escort us to the women's restroom and back through the crowd, but he also made sure to scare away any shady looking dudes. We totally felt safe. And it wasn't even our VIP table!

The DJ was spinning hip hop beats - EVERYONE in the club was dancing. The space is not very big, and in fact, you feel pretty boxed in because of the rectangular multi-level layout. But that just forces you to get cozy with everyone, and for the most part, the people we encountered were pretty cool.

Every now and then they'll do a special birthday shout out that includes hot dancers and huge sparklers, and blast foam snowflakes from the ceiling. 

It was the perfect spot to end our last night in Vegas. Will definitely be back on a Sunday night!

So hard including this name "Mon Ami Gabi" in our conversation
Frustrated friend: "Augh I don' t know, the Gabi thing in front!!"

Came here because
1) Right in front of our hotel
2) They specialize in slabs of cow :)***

I was very set on ordering the filet mignon with merlot butter once I skimmed the Yelp reviews and was told by our waitress that it was Mon Ami Gabi's house special.

By the way, we had the most thorough and humble waitress. She didn't constantly check on us, but made sure that the our food was delivered as ordered. 
She noticed that my girlfriend's cesar salad was dressed when she clearly said "dressing on the side," but my friend insisted it was okay. At the end, the waitress apologized as we got a free ice cream profiterole with hazelnut chocolate sauce. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=DVi5g-v4i81TzV_X5owU2g ..APOLOGY ACCEPTED!!

I would say the filet mignon was too legit (to quit), I know why they're known for it. It seemed to be cooked medium at first upon the sides, but later realized that toward the center it was medium rare as I requested. I expected the size to be "petit" but it was big enough for me to feel guilty for leaving some behind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=zxQGjORGM_oGCDJZX0IYNg

I wish they had better sides than the frites, they reminded me of chips. I prefer something creamier, less oily & fried things for my steak sides (heh).

Everyone else enjoyed their meal, and everyone was entertained/distracted by our friend trying to slice our table's loaf of house bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Z6_9c7qeqRbbY2VQX3im4g 

Gabi est mon ami!

Dearest FnB,

I realize we have just met and I am putting a lot of weight on our first evening together...but I love you.  I have been infatuated before and I know this is so much more than that.

Last night, even as I sat staring into your local produce, the sweetness of your grilled butternut squash still upon my lips, this poem was forming in my mind.  I know it is not original but a take off from the great Elizabeth Barrett Browning of the Romantic Movement.  To me it feels right and fitting that a great sonnet taken from among the best the world has to offer is an appropriate way to enumerate your intoxicating virtues:

FnB, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height of your menu
My palate can reach, when tasting out of sight
For the local produce being prepared in grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's meal

Ok, that's enough romance.  When can I get with you again, FnB?  I must have you from the top of your delicate appetizers all the way through to your sweet and tender desserts.  You plied me with your cranberry infused vodka and zest of lemon, your spiced roasted nuts bursting with flavor again and again.

Your crispy rock shrimp, flash-fried to tender perfection in their light and revealing cornmeal covering are etched upon my mind.  And the jalapeno tartar...you can be a spicy vixen indeed!  Your lovely salad of apple, celery root, walnuts and blue cheese was sublime in it's awakening flavors brought on by the simple vinegary coating, awakening in me the abiding desire to plough through your menu and consume you to your core.

Yes, from there it rolled inexorably on to grilled butternut squash with pear and bacon, each bright flavor building on the next.  The fried green tomatoes were a revelation to us both (yes you had us both, you saucy wench) with their tart and delicate interiors exploding through the complimenting dressing and feta cheese with which you plied them.

Oh yes!  And your flatiron steak...I don't often play with the red meat team but your presentation, your flavor...purple and cheddar cauliflower, caper and golden raisin salsa verde...enough I say, you overwhelm me with your generosity, you just give and give until...

And your desserts!  I tremble at the thought of your chocolate bread pudding, macerated cherries all over with nary a care of what others may think!  Outstanding!

As if all of this were not enough your service throughout the meal was warm and comforting.  To a member, I felt your staff was there to please me and me alone.

But, Fnb, as in all healthy relationships, open and honest communication is tantamount to a wonderful and enduring relationship.  With that understanding I have the following constructive criticism.  I had to look deep within to find even the hint of a fault...your fried green tomatoes.  When my mother used to make them they were sliced more thinly and fried in a skillet...this made them delightfully crunchy on the outside.

Oh my God, have I compared you to my mother?!  Freud be damned! Just forget that, and forgive me FnB.  I'll be back soon.

In heartfelt adoration,

Jim W

For my 600th review, it seemed appropriate to write about the place that brought me to the scenic wonderland of the Midwest, The University of Illinois here in delightful Urbana-Champaign.

For a Southern California pseudo-hipster and person of color raised in Los Angeles and educated in San Diego, the U of I is a bit of a disorienting shock.  It's gigantic, yet full of personality and character.  It's also on some levels every stock stereotype about the 'college experience', from the pretentious architecture (that screams "we look like an East Coast college!!!  Bricks!!  Yay!!!") to the terrifying/amazing/astounding/bizarrely huge percentage of students involved in a Greek life that resembles in almost creepy detail the stereotypical movie depictions of said groups, to the absolute obsession Illini sports engenders.

I love a lot of it, with the fantastic resources, first class scholarship and immense potential.  I turned down Stanford and a few other 'name' schools as I was amazed and remain constantly impressed by their history doctoral program, and I'm thankful to be here for the education.  However, the location is a bit remote (although sometimes corn can be charming, I swear!), and there are some considerable issues here at U of I that have to be mentioned.

While the U of I is definitely a brilliant academic institution and a great place for meaningful exchanges of ideas, diversity is weak here, and cultural understanding/communication is particularly weak.  The issues surrounding the infamous mascot linger on years after its supposed resolution, and to be a person of color in central Illinois is occasionally a difficult and daunting prospect indeed.  I've been called the 'n' word already, and it's a hard place to process when there are screaming groups of students that have been known to have 'tacos and tequila' parties and still openly ask for the return of a racial caricature as a mascot.  It's daunting, but not insurmountable.

Most of the students I've met here are friendly, engaging, and generally cheerful.  They mean well, although it is *hard* to sometimes deal with racism either explicit or less intentional, honestly, and incidences like this year's vandalism of the Native American art exhibit outside the culture houses are emblematic of that.

That said, the school's trying.  The people of color are vibrant that are here, there is a good community, and it's growing.  I'm thankful for that.  There's a strong organizing tradition here.  People *care* about things, and it's nice to see.

A year after accepting their decision to come here, I don't regret it one bit, but Illinois is far from perfect or ideal.  It's a fantastic and wonderfully intellectually rigorous place, but it's also a daily challenge, particularly for us people of color who often have to fight to make our own spaces.  But I love it enough here to keep trying, and I certainly won't stop any time soon.

Besides, I've got at least another four years to go 'til I get to be Dr. Teej.

Another fun staycation. I'm just glad it was free! The room was clean and spacious enough for us. We let them know ahead of time that we would need to use the sofa bed and they assured us that it would have a blanket, sheets and pillows, but it didn't. The sofa bed was not comfortable and flimsy. The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare. I didn't plan on cooking a meal anyway so found it useless. There is a small stove-top yet no coffee maker? I didn't get that. At least at a "motel" I would have had a coffee maker and coffee/tea packets complimentary. The fridge was stocked, but I didn't get anything from it since it is overpriced. Be careful when opening these fridges because if you even pick something up to look at, the sensor will know and charge your room for it. 

There is a cafe, bar, starbucks and of course room service for food options, but nothing else as far as I could see for dining. At least there are other hotels within City Center to check out dining options at and of course shopping. I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone but if you get the chance to stay here for free, do it!

Whooooo boy!!

This is a doosey.

I got a call today from Anne Gregory. The man on the phone ( Brian?) asked if I posted a review online. I say yes.

He responds "Well, I really wish you hadn't done that."

wait. huh?

This guy then proceeds to berate me for giving them an unfavorable review. He brought up my complaint that they never called me back once they got the sample dress in, by saying that the reason for that was that the dress was far above my price range.  (I'm positive that this is true. While my budget wasn't modest, some of the dresses here can run well over 10k, so the fact that the dress wasn't feasible for me financially doesn't surprise me.)

Unfortunately, I had asked and they had promised me that they would call whenever the dress came in. Had they phoned me and simply said that the dress was in, but it was far above my budget, that would have been fine and the fact that they followed up with me would have been reflected in my original review. Instead, they provided me with bad customer service by ignoring me because they guessed that they probably wouldn't be making any money anyway, so why bother with a 60 second task?

And then this phone call....

I'm not exaggerating at all, berate is absolutely the word to describe this. I didn't get much of a chance at all to respond to his explanation, and then this guys says 

"I don't know what else to say except that I'm sorry that you feel that way. I just really hope that some day, people like you aren't able to do things like this."

Hoooo!

 If someone posts a negative review, unless that review is completely unfounded or is attacking someone personally unrelated to the job being performed, the business should either let it go, try to make sure the same problem doesn't occur again with a future customer, or do something to rectify the present situation. 

Calling the reviewer and attacking them personally for an honest and not really all that inflammatory assessment is just classless and immature. Even a pitch perfect business will get a negative review every now and then. 

Its such a shame too, because the conversation easily could have gone a different way had this guy truly cared about the store's reputation or understood good customer care. Though apologizing and explaining what happened probably wouldn't have changed my personal opinion of Anne Gregory, it would at least show that they care about their customer's experience and opinion of them. Clearly that's not the case. 

Suffice to say, the actions of at least one Anne Gregory employee have changed my original review from "I didn't have a good experience, I would not do business with them" to SERIOUSLY.
HOLY SHIT, DO NOT GO HERE.

LIVING PARASITE IN OUR FOOD - Manager did not care! - PICS INCLUDED

I signed up to yelp just so I could write this single review about Donovan's chop house in Phoenix AZ.

My fiance and I went out for a night of celebrating. 
A $250 meal is not uncommon for us, but usually with that type of price tag comes a certain level of service. Not at Donovan's Chop house in Phoenix.

It started when my fiance finished her oysters and noticed that something was in the oyster shell that she just ate from.
"Is that moving?" she said?
"yes, yes it is" I replied.

Not only was it moving, but it was alive.

Turns out that a 'pea crab' was living inside of the oyster that my fiance just ate. We looked it up right then and there. According to google pea crabs are parasites that feed off of the oysters food supply.
When I showed the server, she was stunned. She told me she would shot h chef.
I asked her to show the manager too, and she said "No, the chef will know what to do", as if I wanted the thing steamed and served with a side of butter.

Our meal came, and when I asked about the pea crab, neither the expediter nor the bus boy, knew about our situation. It was only after I asked the server about what the chef said that the situation was acknowledged at all. 
It was actually a full hour after finding the crab before the manager came over to drop off our check.

She never apologized and never once said that they would make changes and actually look for crabs in their oysters. She approached the entire situation with as much care as a short order cook that put mayonnaise on a burger by mistake.
 
When I showed her the pics of the creature on my phone, she laughed and said these exact words "Well, at least you have a fun story to tell".
And she is absolutely correct. I tell everyone the story and it goes something like this:

We went to Donovan's Chop House in Phoenix and found a living parasite inside one of the oysters we just ate.  The manager waited a full hour before coming to our table and laughed off our experience as a "fun story".  After being freaked out by finding a living creature in our food, the most she did for us was to knock $12 off of our $250 bill and did the bare minimum to make the situation right.

Great story huh Donovan's?

Here are the pics:

The rest of the food was good, but not amazing.
The special of the day was a $68 pasta which was the best part of the meal.

Update: We've returned several times now and tried more of their menu. 

The Taro Mung Bean Slush and also the Matcha Milk were both great! Thick, rich in flavor, high quality ingredients, and not at all too icy or watery. Lots of flavor! 

Their Taro Milk Tea w/ honey boba is also rich and deep in taro flavor (they don't use artificial tasting ingredients)  It's not a bad choice, but also not my personal favorite - my boyfriend loves it (I'll sneak a sip here and there.)

Honey Black Tea with honey boba has a robust steeped black tea flavor and the honey boba sweetens it up nicely. It's a great choice if you're feeling something lighter and refreshing.

Taro and Red Bean Slush is crazy BOMB as well! It's thick and has bold taro and red bean flavor. They use all quality ingredients. You won't taste powder here! If you can't handle (seriously delicious) flavor, I wouldn't recommend it. ;) 

WOW Green Milk with added Red Bean is another a great choice. It's not actually a milk tea- it's lactose free milk with red bean, mung bean, and honey boba toppings. Give this one a whirl if you're feeling adventurous. You'll enjoy the chewy textures of the beans and boba.

My personal favorite has to be the Golden Oolong Milk Tea w/ honey boba. I can't stop drinking it. If you enjoy flavorful milk tea that's not too thick, this is the perfect choice! It's refreshing and the honey boba sweetens it up nicely.

Also, we always make sure to communicate to them that we want it sweet, but not a sugar bomb and they always hook us right up! Just tell them the percentage of sugar you want them to add: 

Less sugar: 70%
Half Sugar: 50%
Little sugar: 30%
No sugar: 0% duh :p

Thanks KFT crew!

Pro tip: the honey in the boba dissolves into the drink if you drink it very slowly (like we do.) So at first it might not seem too sweet, but in due time it will become sweeter. Just FYI for the non sweets peeps! Just add more ice and you're back in business baby!

Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community. 

RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino. 

The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.  

The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history. 

They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio. 

I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains true to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to "Americanize" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business. 

Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films

Wow I expected much more from one of the Venetian's flagship eateries.
  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=I4InWGszg4yUFN2ReYq_Ig&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

I stepped up to the plate as I was debating between the Grand Lux & the new burger joint Rattlecan. I opted for the tried and true and struck out several times. 

I had no wait to be seated and as I was guided to my table I almost wiped out as I slipped on the greasy floor in front of one of the kitchen door. STRIKE ONE!.

After studying hard to read the menu in the very dimly lit back of the resturant I decided on several items for dinner.

FOOD ORDERED:
Salisbury Chopped Kobe Steak 
House Green Salad 

A guy (manager?) came to me about 10 min after I ordered and told me that the chef did not like the look of the kobe beef, and would not serve it customers. This tells me that they didn't have any kobe beef. Regaudless, I had to pick another choice now almost 20 min into the trip.  STRIKE TWO!

FOOD Re-ORDERED:
Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi
House Green Salad 

WHAT I GOT:
House Green Salad ...  my salad and it was very good the blue cheese dressing was exceptional (although they charged me extra for it)  4****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VRVeFAfNVQtqdjvAZ23rQQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi ... I was pretty suprised by the entree it had lightly breaded shrimp in a citrius tasting cream sauce, masted potatoes grilled green beans and a thin piece of fried chicken with scallions. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tvJj23joNXjio7SdhYC5QA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
This was not like any scampi I'd ever eaten nor was the chicken although tender very "royal".  Both tasted ok but I was not thrilled with what I got. The Mashed potatoes wer good as were the beans even though they were cold.

I finished my meal, the buss lady took away my plates and I waited for my check. And waited, and waited until I finally flagged down another waitress who said she'd inform my waitress, and I waited some more. Finally after 15 min I got a check then had to wait 5 more min for her to run my card. STRIKE THREE! 

Grand Lux Cafe YOU're OUT!

The Grand Lux Cafe is is a very nice place with great atmosphere, maybe a tad too dark but it needs to really work on the service.

I will not return to Grand Lux Cafe.

After my third trip to Tien Wong, I thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves, even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol!

Hot Pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese. It is an absolutely amazing concept and is a great group or date event. It is a blast to go through and pick different veggies and tofu (they have meat and fish as well) and try new things you never would have tried under normal circumstances.

I have really grown to love the greens, Tang O, taro root, the five spice tofu, and the iced tofu. They have probably 5-6 kinds of mushrooms, bock choy, spinach, four or five types of noodles, dumplings, and somehow like 4-5 different types of tofu! It is amazing! You also get a peanut and a soy dipping sauce, but I think the flavor of the vegetables drenched in miso is amazing without any sauce!

I saw someone complain about the price here on Yelp, but we had dinner last night for 4 with a hot tea and a dessert for $50.00 total. We had 4 different dishes of tofu and 7 different kinds of vegetables in our huge pot of miso broth so that we could try our a variety. Every single one of us was stuffed and remained full throughout the rest of the night. I think it is a great value. 

People who don't normally eat vegetables or Asian enjoy the fun experience, and enjoy being able to try something they normally wouldn't. Also a great place to take a group of people so that you can all try something a little different.

After seeing so many of my friends check in to this place and proceeded to give it no less than 4 stars, I knew it had to be good. Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!

So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entre comes out. 

So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place "Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sauted veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it. 

As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.

So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!

***Le Cirque's lobster risotto was excellent and the prices were not completely unreasonable given that it was Vegas; still, the old-fashioned style (while pleasant enough) will probably keep me from returning***

Le Cirque is a very small fine dining spot located in The Bellagio.  The atmosphere is circus-like with a multicolored tent ceiling and many nice circus murals throughout the room.  The circus decor is even evident in the striped chairs.

Le Cirque is a French restaurant (that had a Michelin Star when they still did Michelin Stars in Las Vegas) and the menu features two options--a tasting menu or a 3 course menu where you pick a starter, an entree and a dessert.

They started us off with a few complimentary items like some okay French bread and a good butternut squash soup that was finished with cream.

We elected for the 3 course pre fixe and I started with the lobster risotto.  The lobster risotto was good.  I felt the rice was a little overcooked (I think it needed a little more bite), but the flavor of the dish was good and it was nice and creamy.  The lobster was very soft and fresh.

I would not put Le Cirque's lobster risotto up there with Sona's offering because the lobster at Sona was a higher quality and Sona utilized bigger chunks of lobster, which resulted in a more memorable experience.  Still, the lobster risotto at Le Cirque was very good.

I then had the duck for my entree.  The plate included some nicely cooked duck breast that was moist and tender.  While the duck was good, the sides were just okay.  The sides included some pommes souffle, a cassis reduction (which had solidified), some roasted chestnuts, and fried grapes.  The plate could have used some vibrance.  While the duck was good, the plate felt a little old-fashioned.

The entree also came with a little container of duck confit in kind of a stew.  This was savory, sweet and very good.

For dessert, I had the chocolate souffle, which came with some vanilla ice cream and a creme anglais.  The chocolate souffle had a good chocolate flavor though it was not prepared appropriately.  It was a tad dry.  While I am not a fan of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, their chocolate souffle is better than the one at Le Cirque.

I also had a banana ice cream on the side and it was decent--nice and creamy but maybe a tad too soft.

The meal ended with some good petit fours including chocolates and macarons.

Service was good, but it was not as polished as service I have had at other fine dining spots in Vegas.  The food still came out at a quick pace and the staff was pleasant.

Prices were high, but it was probably not much more expensive than the nearby Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Le Cirque is significantly better.

There were parts of Le Cirque that I liked very much (such as the lobster risotto and the little stew of duck confit), but I did not end up loving the restaurant.  There were some good things about it and in some ways Le Cirque succeeds where so many overpriced Vegas restaurants fail.  Still, the food felt a little old-fashioned.  And even though I did like Le Cirque more than some other old-fashioned fine dining spots I've tried (like LA's Valentino), I still did not like it enough to want to return.

The Bellagio features complimentary valet and self parking.

*This review is for the salon*

While staying with friends at The Venetian for yet another free staycation, my friend and I decided to get manicures at the salon here. Too bad the manicures weren't free too! First, the walk getting to this place is ridiculous. I did like the colorful walls and decor, but it was too loud for a spa. I got dizzy every time I turned a corner and it was another long and colorful hallway. I kept wondering if this place was hidden in a deep dark tunnel. When we got to the front desk of the salon I noticed two employees laughing away and chit chatting. I wasn't sure if they noticed us standing there or not, but after the long walk it took to get to the salon and then standing there for 15 minutes waiting I wasn't feeling too good about this experience. Finally, these two employees noticed us and said "oh I'm so sorry, how can I help you". Grrrr. 

The salon was packed and looked like a zoo. The hallways leading into this place were so quiet and the front of the salon the same, then you get inside the salon and the noise level escalates. I had a "Spa Manicure" that cost $50 and I got a locals discount. The woman who did the manicure was nice, but seemed rushed. The couch style seat was comfy, but this place was just too crowded and loud to even hear the person next to you well. My manicure looked good, but average. For the price I would hope for a bit more space with maybe less people at once inside, the manicurist to take her time and the noise brought down a couple notches. The manicurist was nice and didn't control the appointments so I felt sorry for her. This wont be a regular stop for me, but with the right locals deal I would come back to try out their spa services.

Grimaldi's was initially not part of my itinerary during my last Vegas trip but since I was at the Palazzo Shoppes at around lunch, I unexpectedly found the spot and decided to give it a try.  I've heard a great deal about Grimaldi's from Travel Channel and Food Network so I figured it would be worth a try.

By my waiter's recommendation, I ordered my personal sized pizza with Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushrooms.  And here's my work of art:
http://bit.ly/115EmrX
It's gonna sound very cliche but here it goes:  This was one damn good pizza!  Probably one of the best I've ever eaten!  From the moment my waiter brought it to my table, I seriously got giddy.  The aroma coming from the fresh cut meats and cheese was very amazing!  The crust, while crispy, still had a nice soft chew to it and had a nice rustic flavor to it.  But we all know in the end it's all about the toppings.  You can tell by the pic that everything was cut fresh and handmade.  And when I took that first bite, I was in pizza bliss =)  Very delicious!!  It was really handcrafted with a lot of love.

I'm glad that I decided to deviate from my itinerary and stop over to Grimaldi's.  Now I understand what all the hype was all about!  One of the best pizzas ever!  I'm definitely coming back again for another delicious pizza pie!  Fuhgeddaboudit!!

Three words:  Fuck this place.  If it wasn't for the fact they carry gluten-free/dairy-free coconut milk Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, Tamari Wheat-Free Soy Sauce, Hemp Milk, Boston  Baked Beans, Brown rice in bulk, Blueberry gluten-free waffles, and a variety of bulk spices and flours, I would never shop here.  With the exception of the checkout clerks, the rest of the staff is not only completely worthless, they are, for the most part, grumpy ass holes.  ESPECIALLY the managers.

I tried doing a special order one time to purchase a case of large bottles of Tamari soy sauce.  Haha, oh what a fail.  They never called me, like they said they would when it arrived, so I finally called to inquire.  "We've got it in", the manager said, "come on down.".  Sweet.  I get in my car, drive down there and what do you know, they don't have it.  Wtf?  The guy looked everywhere and 35mins later, we agreed it was lost and I ordered another case.  Well, 2 weeks later, again, no phone call on their part, I called and they said it was in.  When I got there I asked to open the box to check my order, and what do you know, they ordered the wrong product.  They ordered the low-sodium (which needs to be cooled) instead of the regular.  Fuck it, I took it anyway.

We have had to return four (4) packages of beef that went sour before the sell-by date.  FOUR!  Each time greeted by an unapologetic, seemingly annoyed manager.  We were never offered anything in exchange for our troubles.  The third time I told the guy that not only was he going to refund my $$, he would also be comping my package of fresh beef, which he did, but after a bit of an argument.

A few days ago I was in the store and asked the manager if he had any chocolate syrup other than "Fat-free / Sugar-free" syrup (loaded with Splenda!) and he sort of chuckled and said, "No, we're a health-food store", like a pompous cock.  I said to him, "well, real sugar is certainly better for you than fake chemical sweeter" to which he again chuckled and said, "whatever, I'll make sure to let our people know" in an extremely condescending manner.  I just laughed.  First, this guy can only be described as the opposite of healthy.  Second, their store is FULL of sugar candies, IN BULK!!  Third, Splenda is hardly "healthy" for you.  Fucking idiot.

So yeah, avoid this store, if you can.  Unfortunately, it would be more of a major inconvenience for me to avoid it, so I suffer the pain.  Oh, and don't bother asking a floor guy anything, they're COMPLETELY worthless as well.

I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.

They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. 

I saw on the menu they offer catering. 

The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!

OK, I've decreed that Crust is my favorite pizza and wine restaurant!  (That is, until a few friends prove to me otherwise that there are better NY-style/thin-crust pizza joints in the valley.)  Not only does Crust offer up super-crispy and flavorful Rustica pizzas ("hand-stretched"), but their 20" thin-crust round pies (I've tried the Little Nicky- white pie w/ fresh spinach and tomatoes) and pasta dishes (crusted mac 'n cheese is delicious both fresh and re-heated) are good, too!

I am IN LOVE w/ Crust's filet mignon sliders w/ horseradish cream sauce.  This time the au jus reduction was SUBLIME, and oh so garlicky!  I was told that the "regular" chef was working that day.  To the unnamed chef, I salute you!  :)  The table bread, which you will have to specially request or you won't get any, was great w/ either butter or dunked into the au jus.  MMmm!

As if the steak sliders and the decadent cream sauce ($4.50 for 3 pcs, HH menu) weren't enough- I've got to find out where I can get my hands on those buns these sliders are served on!- I went ahead and ordered a pot of brownie sundae ($9.50).  This was my first time ordering the brownie sundae and had not realized it came served in a mini-caulderon-style pot.  Should you decide to order this sweet, make sure you have at least two other tablemates w/ you to share the wealth!  The walnut brownie came w/ sliced bananas, fudge sauce, and a scoop of ice cream and then topped w/ homemade whip cream and a maraschino cherry!  If you're a sundae fan, you'll love this delectable sweet pot!

Addendum 10/30:
So why not 5 stars?  The atmosphere here isn't as inviting as it could be.  I never minded much about this quality until I spent happy hour with three friends at Cork last night.  (What a beautiful and cozy space Cork has!  Cork review coming soon!)  I'm assuming it's intentional- this being a pizza and wine cafe, the owners want quick turnovers.  Am I right?  Hmm...

You know...  They really shouldn't give us a lot of time between flights to allow people to write reviews after their flights get canceled or rescheduled or what ever.   As I am writing this, I honestly do not know what the heck is going on, other than they are telling me that the plane designated to go to Long Beach.... will not.

Ok.  I don't want to go on a plane that is going to crash.  That would suck worse.  Current departure somewhere is almost 2 hours delay, due to aircraft maintenance.  Then, a quarter of the passengers got booted off and sent to much later flights or to other locations. My flight got sent to another gate and another plane.

There is a reason why there is a predominance of 1 and 2 star reviews; and I question anything 3 stars or higher. Either it was a ridiculously good day for the airline or they are somehow being charitable.  Regardles, I pity the staff and the passengers. 

As I am sitting in the plane now, I am thankful for the accommodation, but it doesn't change my review. Let's just hope this bugger doesn't crash.....

Wish me luck.

Continuation....  Now we are going back to the gate because the windshield heaters are not working.   Well, neither is the AC.

I like a sauna.  Should I up my review?  2 hours in the terminal and another undefined amount of time on the plane.

At least we haven't crashed (yet).

Continuation #2....  Now de - planed in Phoenix.  These are types of flights that you can't believe.  Still no information on a reschedule over 3 hours after we were supposed to take off.  Maintenence is working in heat over 100 degrees to fix the issue with some sort of sensor.

I think I'm going to keep on updating as I go.  Wow.....

Continuation #3...  Back on the plane 20 minutes ago.    Door closed and ready to move.  It's only 4 hours and 30 minutes late (so far). There are only 12 airplanes in front of us, according to the flight attendant.

Go US Airways!!!  Will see if they offer anything to make up for it.   But, I doubt it.

Continuation #4 and last.   Finally arrived in Long Beach 4 and a half hours after I was supposed to.  And, of course, US Airways did nothing to compensate.   Not even a free drink on board.

Hope you enjoyed the read....

This place has a great bakery for Asian bread type items or Banh Mi as my friend Jando insists upon :) 

Plus they do very good sandwiches at good prices. The sandwiches are mainly Asian style but also has just standard turkey, ham etc. on fresh rolls and croissants.

All types of drinks, juices, boba teas and smoothies.

My favorite thing is the fresh squeezed sugar cane juice. On this visit it was perfect. I got a hollow donut it was hot and fresh. Not really a donut but more like a lightly sweetened bread exterior with almost no bread inside. Whatever

Staff was friendly as usual and it came out pretty quick. I love the automated voice telling you your order number is ready. It's cool and creepy cuz it's almost movie voice and you're being called in. kinda weird but go get something and wait for your order and you'll think...hmmm this is weird but it's all really good.

The only knock was the seating and table area wasn't clean as it normally is. It was in rough shape.

Takes this 5 star trip at Lees today to 4 star. 

Of course I'll be back cuz I like the consistency of the food, people and free wifi.

In honor of my YFF being today's ROTD holder, I declare an end to my review hiatus.

Thailicious has sat motionless in my bookmarks for months, ever since mon ami Kristin J first alerted me to its existence.  The name alone evokes images of "superlicious delish", as the superlicious Mary A states.

The characters in this screenplay are as follows...
Joyce W - my YFF and international essay contest winner, who I shall refer to as J-WoW.  If you want to read an actual well written review, check hers out.
Linh L - one of today's top talents in beat-boxing, who I shall refer to as Mr Peanut.  If you want to read an actual amusing review, check his out.
Brett B - the author of this autobiography, who I shall also refer to as Mr Peanut
The Waitress - who I shall refer to as Flo

As an author, whose responsibility it is to convey an experience to you, the reader, I hope you'll be able to take away this... I arrived AND checked in prior to either J-WoW or Mr Peanut!

After 'handshakes & hugs', we gangsta strolled up into that beyaaaa...ah.  What a sight it must have been.  Two of us could have passed for cast members from the Asian version of Melrose Place, while the third closely resembled Zippy the pinhead.

We were promptly ushered to a booth with what appeared to be vinyl seats, and I make this distinction to inform the reader that as I scootched myself across the bench, an inopportune vibration was simulcast from the vicinity of my pants bottom.  Not wanting to appear like a wind-talker in front of my co-diners, I made an effort to replicate the sound by continuing my side-glide until successive audible vinyl rubs were rendered.  But no such vindication was attained...

My companions were a true delight.  Dear reader, may you be blessed with your own J-WoWs and Mr Peanuts.  Lunch doesn't always have to just be about binging on 1800 calorie entrees.  Open your heart, and your heart may just open you back.

I ordered the Pad See Ew, vegetarian style as a nod to my girl Cici F.  Now, I'm down with PSE, yeah, you know me.  It's my jam.  The dish gets my merkin a twerkin... however this one didn't have the je ne sais quoi of Thai Spices or Thai Rama, but that didn't dissuade me from a raucous display in which no less than half of the deadly sins were involved.

After putting in our dessert order, I asked Flo if she would be so kind as to provide me with a spoon, say... eighteen or nineteen inches in length.  Now here's the kicker.  She looked at me like I was a damned fool.

That delightful Thai Tea Creme Brulee dessert proved to be the meal's Swan Song. It boasted a sun kissed glow that could have passed for San Diego's own TM, a consistency smoother than my girl MC J, and was reminiscent of everything that's right about pumpkin pie without the benefits of high protein or dietary fiber.  How is no one singing its praises?

[Chorus - Nicki Minaj, J-Wow & Mr Peanut:]
Flo, I got this short-azz spoon in my hand
Beating like a drum on a treat that's all tanned
Can't you taste that creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee?
You got that creme brulee
creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee
Yeah, that's the creme brulee
(Creme) [x15]

Side Note: If you enjoy leering at beautiful women from the shadows, as they make selections from a salad bar, then boy are you in luck!

Tonight we found our new little hole in the wall joint. Brand new at this location ( the owner has another in the camelback swapmart)  this is one sweet little find. Housed in a small restaurant that just opened in the beginning of January . 

Clean and neat as you enter this place ,  it seems ready to meet all your soul food needs. The menu offers such standards as fried chicken , fried catfish , ribs,  waffles and my new favorite  fried shrimp. We we first entered the service was a bit off , with many people coming in for take out and us sitting down we kind of got lost in the crowd. But soon our waiter got back to us with apologies and we were ready to start the meal.   For tonight's meal we had Catfish , cornbread , yams , fried shrimp, cabbage , beans and rice and sweet potatoe pie.   From the first taster we were happy with our choice to stop in. With tons of pepper and soul this food made us feel homestyle good. We were impressed with each item with exception to the macaroni and cheese , which  was a bit bland in comparison to bursts of flavor in everything else.  Big favorite were  the cabbage -wow what a tasty surprise great home seasoning and velvety taste. 
We also really liked the sweet potato pie , it was in a light crust and had a delicate flavor not overly sweeten and very smooth. 

The owner is a big sweetheart of a guy and offered us a taste of his new macaroni salad which tasted like dear old moms.  Yum! 

If you go give a call and ask if they are serving your favorite because with the great tastes they are serving they go quick!   Can't wait to go back and try the ribs!

Here's a note: if you decide not to head our reviews and go anyways, make sure you don't have your boyfriend with you. Who knows, maybe he'll leave you at the 2nd floor to go down to the first floor to "drop off" that girl you weren't too sure about and end up "losing" him the rest of the evening only to find out that he made a move on her after "convincing" you that oh, no, she's "just a friend" and "I'm sooo not attracted to her" because she looks like "a cheap skank" (ok those last words were mine, but she really did look like a cheap skank).

I might not have paid the extraordinary amount (100 bones) to get in, but who the hell cares. It took forever. I stood outside wondering...ok, not wondering, more like stumbling...when the hell they were going to "take care of it" and let us in the VIP! Oh yeah-there is something you should know about this club. It has two floors of VIP, so you can be awesome sauce for one and smelly shit for the other. They also don't let you give lapdances on the couches downstairs (so what the HELL are they doing there?!), and that killed even the buzz I had which is weird because I was pretty fucking hammered.

One of their "waitresses" looked like an even cheaper version of Tila Tequila. Ew. (I'll love you Dani!!!)

There was NO dance floor...so again, why can't I give a lapdance to my NOW EX boyfriend?!?! 

At least the party I was with had money to buy the bottle service. Also, they had full length mirrors I couldn't stop looking at myself in.

Summary: You want to get cheated on? Totally take your boyfriend here. Just make sure you don't go to bed at 3am, wake up at 7, spend 18 dollars on a pack of cigarettes and a lighter and proceed to tell your journal that maybe you really are in love with him and its totally something you can get passed until you crawl back into bed with him and ask him to talk to you and suddenly next thing you know he told you to pack up get out and you're flights delayed while he trys to find a computer with internet to take you off his myspace page.

No, I'm not bitter--why do you ask?

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

In between a 4 and 4.5

The last time I was in Vegas was several years ago when they were BUILDING the Wynn, so it I suppose it's only fitting that my first visit after a 4+ year hiatus be at the hotel that wasn't even open when I was here last.  It's almost as if they had built the hotel for me and my first visit was long overdue.  But that's just wishful thinking.

The Wynn being one of Vegas' more recent hotels, there are a few aspects of the hotel that follow an architectural pattern with some of the other newer hotels.  Take the parking garage for example.  Instead of parking garages where you go round and round as you ascend multiple levels of parking, the ramp to climb each level is on the exterior of the structure so the interior resembles more that of a supermarket parking lot.  Why I'm spending so much time talking about the parking structure I have no idea.

Walking into the casino.... Oh look, slot machines!  Poker tables!  Scantily clad cocktail waitresses!  All these (and more) you will find in just about any casino, old or new, in Las Vegas.  *sigh* What a life....

My friend was able to score an upgrade up to the 52nd floor.  Yes, you heard me... FIFTY TWO.  All 3 of our rooms had great views.  The room I was in specifically had a view of the strip, and while the other 2 rooms were on the other side of the hotel, their room were overlooking a golf course.  The rooms were standard: bed, sofa and ottoman, wall-mounted flat screen TV, desk with a video phone and fax machine, and books and booklets detailing the room and resort amenities.  The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub, dual sinks with a vanity in between, a small wall TV, and a segregated toilet with a phone.  Hey, it solves the problem of answering the phone call while you're seated on the throne.  I'm just saying.

I don't have to tell you that the hotel overall is just gorgeous.  The theme of the brown and gold exterior of the hotel seamlessly transports itself to the color scheme inside.  The layout of the casino and surrounding areas is not complicated to navigate and makes everything seem easily accessible.  All of the dealers I dealt with were nice, patient and courteous, except for maybe the late late hours when they're not as talkative and would probably prefer being in bed instead of handing out winnings at the craps tables.  Yes, I found my new poison of choice at the casino: craps.  I never understood the game up until this trip when a couple of my friends explained a few basics and I experienced some beginner's luck.  One session I had started with $30 and within an hour, I had quadrupled my money.

We did have a chance to experience any of the fine restaurants here at the Wynn, which include Mario Batali's Bartolotta or Daniel Boulud Brasserie.  We did however eat at their buffet for brunch for one of our meals (review to come).

Would I stay here again?  Well, not unless I scored some sort of deal or promo (which my friend did) or we were in a larger group, like we were, bringing down the room cost for everybody.

I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood dcor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.

The Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. 

The server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.

I then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, "We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink." Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.

The owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, "I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro."

I have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.

I would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same.

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

I have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. 

3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!

It was a Saturday night, my LV partner-in-crime and I were in the Aria Hotel, and decided to dine at Julian Serrano after reviewing the menu. Truth be told, since this resto name somewhat resembles mine (as people have mispronounced and called me by this name along with others- ask me about if you're interested), dining here was really a no-brainer. hah! With no reservations, we chanced it and apparently lady luck was on our side, as there was no wait. 

The warm colors of the restaurant looked so inviting. Here's a pic of the bar area, taken with my iPhone http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=0OlrsQnQXZSPeD5NFJMvmA
From our table, here's a shot of the entire restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GblIBlQF3t_da6M1L-zYbw

Everything on the menu looked so delicious, so we ordered (and pics credit go to my girl, Li):
- Beet Salad: Roasted and oh so beetalicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=758bzflJcsXww0Lrl4dYeA

- Beef with Brie: Tender pieces, with brie, (one of my fav cheeses). Oh Mylanta, such a digalicious combo, and with walnuts on top, and the savory sauce was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=ILrElkjFRWwhzXsjWWQ8xA

- Striped bass: Fresh fish, cooked to perfection. Delish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=z4xiwtEsBVbf-jFhDgX7AA

- Creamy Risotto with Mushrooms and Manchego: Mouth watering deliciousness, and so rich, creamy, and cheesey goodness!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=bJAq88XYZOcUhvlGSTUkuA

- Pan Manchego: Spanish Toast with roasted tomato and garlic paste with melted Manchego cheese. All I have to say is mas pan, mas pan! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=HLxPDvdXAqwLErnnHtCVdw

-Chocolate Cake: Chocolate molten cake, which rivals my favorite chocolate souffle at Roy's Hawaiian restaurant. Combined with mango sorbet, and I was in dessert heaven with these two loves of mine.
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=Igp440NlqPIVtgwWajkFfw

While we feasted so well, our beverages were refreshing white sangria (para mi) and red sangria (para mi amiga), and later had very 'brave' coffee. We needed the caffeine jolt, as it was only the beginning of a very fun and memorable night out.

Que bueno, Julian Serrano! Beautiful interior, efficient service, reasonable prices, and wonderful food. This is a great restaurant for a date, a small or big group of friends, and perfect for getting the night started off right in Sin City! Viva Las Vegas!!

What a monumental shithole Treasures.

Cover charge at 4:30 in the afternoon was $33.00. Almost immediately upon entering you're besieged with hustling bitches trying to shake you down for table dances at twenty bucks a pop. Should you decline, they'll step up their marketing skills by offering you a package of five dances for only one-hundred dollars. 
God, they're clever. I think that works out to, oh wait, twenty dollars a dance.
As I said, clever.

When servers ask for your drink order, they'll immediately ask how you're going to pay for it, suggesting perhaps you may be homeless and without funds for such a wondrous event. 
The look on your face suggests you're experiencing a wtf moment. 

          " Cash or credit card?" she annoyingly barks while you're still in disbelief.

Shaken down at the door, now insulted, as if you were going to swill down a beer and beeline it for an awaiting cab without paying, you begin to reassess if any of this was worth it.

Whether your response is cash or credit, they'll demand payment up front prior to taking the order. I believe this is because, and this is only conjecture mind you, their default statement is to not trust anyone who graces their shit hole establishment for fear they're part shit hole too. It's a projection thing I guess.

Don't get suckered into a VIP dance in the back room by one of the many fleeting nubiles promenading about.. They're there for one reason. To take you to the 'back room'.
If you do get suckered into a back room dance, the fee starts at $100 with a $32 two-drink minimum, again, all paid up front of course. And god help you if you happen to get caught up in the moment, losing count of your five song 'deal'. The sixth song just shot the price up to $250 along with a now $50 two-drink minimum. 
It's like being penalized for getting caught up in the music and whirling tits!

You're now knee-deep in the shit, having unwittingly purchased the multi-dance package and guess what? This time, the dancer doesn't shake you down for loot, she waltzes you over to some guy bigger than all outdoors, whose tone of voice is lower than a 30" subwoofer and whose countenance is that of a guard at Buckingham Palace.

   "Two hundred fifty bucks pal, how you gonna pay?" 

I panic.
The eighth song just began playing and I don't know what the rules are. The seventh shot the price from twenty to thirty-five. After everything I've seen thus far, I'm thinking they're going to ask me to pony up a nut when song number eight begins playing.
I cut my losses and head for the door.

When you've had enough of their bullshit and want to take a cab back to the hotel, guess what, no cabs. 
Oh there are cabs, a cab line and a valet, but you're not going anywhere...not just yet. 
That's because you'll need to grease the valet, this or else wait in a terminally long line of losers who didn't have money to line the valet's pockets.

Here's what I did.
I saw an off-duty cab about 100 yards from their driveway entrance and started toward it.

   "HE'S OFF DUTY!" the valet shouts. 

    "FUCK YOU," I respond politely. 

I offered the taxi driver a fifty to take me anywhere as fast as he could. This so I could begin erasing the entire shitty experience out of my memory. 
He declines, saying he'll get in trouble with va-ray. (Asian)
I make it a Franklin.

  " Hop in" he says.

Everything about Treasures smells to high heaven, including the plethora of Russian whores in cheap perfume and glitter. You'll know who they are immediately.
They speak with the same dialect as that ugly bitch from Rocky & Bullwinkle.

I would only come back here if I won the lottery.

It has been a really LONG time since i've been really wowed by sushi. I came to a point in my life where I really questioned whether or not sushi, in general, has become perpetually trite. After visiting Daisho, my opinion of sushi has changed. This is now my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, and what they are doing here is surprisingly wonderful. Here's why:

First, after walking in the door and being seated by the server at the bar, we were given our menu's. They had the expected items you would see on any sushi menu, but after looking at the appetizer menu, you can tell that these guys are trying to do things distinctive. We had the AYCE menu for 25 bucks, and Tony T. and I started our voyage through this unique menu.

Note: We tried a great volume of items, so I would probably max out the 5000 character limit on Yelp reviews by describing only 1/4 of what we had. There was zilch that I didn't like on menu, but there some dishes that are especially noteworthy.

: Salmon Collar/Yellowtail Collar - This was unbelievable. I was totally blown away, especially by the salmon. The first time I had collar of a fish was at Yonaka, and it was wonderful. On the other hand, the collar at Daisho completely blows Yonaka's out of the water!!! Wonderfully tender, with the natural fat sustaining the moistness of the fish, personally (especially with the salmon), I thought I was eating foie gras. It was prepared with an expert hand, and cooked with precision.  It absolutely melted in the mouth. I'm still thinking about it.

: Uni and Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - Freshest and highest quality uni and salmon roe i've ever had, EVER. The uni had a delicate, but firm texture, and had a clean taste. The same goes for Ikura as well. 

I FINALLY found a place that makes sushi rice correctly!!!! A great deal of people think that it's effortless to create great sushi rice. What folks don't realize is, that in world-class sushi restaurants, sushi apprentices and beginner trainees spend 3-4  (or more) YEARS learning just how to make rice, before they are given the permission to touch a piece of fish. Making sushi rice in itself, is an art form. And these guys nailed it.

A small footnote: This locale is great for low-carbers. There are more than 5 rice less rolls and plenty of apps that do not contain starch or rice, including collar, poke, oysters, yaki-tori and more!!

Talk about some hearty healthy food but with flair since my first impression walked in was is this ultra lounge for body builders or workout fanatics. Really not often you walk into health conscious restaurant see lounge area that can sit down got just about every fitness magazine laid out for reading pleasure (from muscle & fitness, just about every one can think of) but yet still have bar stools and tables relax have meal. One more thought with different. If ever lost in the world of fitness or IFBB need too know who current just walk into the bathrooms. Think kind of weird but too each his own. 

Now what really matters the food. It was my first time so really had no idea direction too go. It decent size menu so had just about every healthy option can think of. I like  the way the menu is structured from bowls, salads, burgers, and drinks. Each list typical healthy options comes too if want switch around protein, carb, add, or build your own healthy creation. I stuck with standard since was my first time. I went with the Southwest Bowl and Berry Jubilee for my drink. The Southwest Bowl was AAAwesome! I went with whole wheat pasta for my carb choice between brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta. I loved the fact that it was HEARTY healthy bowl. I always associate healthy with bare minimum of portion. At Protein House not cheating you out of your protein/carb! The top sirloin was cooked too my exact temp and combine the avacado, roasted tomatoe, roasted red pepper, cheese, and black bean salsa. Nice light sauce neither oily, greasy, and just light/refreshing pasta bowl. I could eat healthy everyday. It between pricey and cheap so not sure if could eat Protein House style healthy everyday. But without doubt you get the most bang for your buck hands down compare too other health restaurants. Look forward too trying more of the menu.

The service was fabulous. One that make point not too go at the last second. Really wanted too try Protein House. 30 minutes is broader line. The whole staff never rushed us although my guilty conscious made me eat faster... Even when I apologize when we first walked in asked if ok they greeted us with smile and walked us through the menu for newbies.

I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.

But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?

Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. 

I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one.

Well well well... I'm the first to review the new Dick's location. Of course I am. I can already hear this review screaming ROTD and I haven't even written it yet... 

1. I'm not gay. This is probably the fourth Yelp in which I've disclosed this. It's not important because you should care what my orientation is but so that you can get a sense of this place from the hetero-perspective.   

2. Many people think I'm in the closet. So if you're rolling your eyes at number one, you're not alone. 

3. Granted, my speech patterns and flamboyant style are confusing, especially if you're from the midwest.* 

4. People are gonna think what they want and life is just really, really good anyway. 

5. I was DD one night and we were driving from E. McDowell to Cenpho. Someone, who shall remain nameless, screams from the back seat, "DICKS!" 

6. We go.

7. The two ladies I "brought" loved it. 

8. One of the dancers is "huge." I want one of those. 

9. I can appreciate male beauty. There were maybe one or two pretty dudes but the rest were just ridiculously fit. Six packs and the like... 

10. Apparently, three more minutes of the grind and my lady friend was gonna not be not actively orgasming. She was with the "huge" dude. 

11. She went back the next night. 

12. My other friend's personal dancer said, "I think I'm enjoying this more than you are." I hang with some sexy ladies. I'm very lucky. 

13. It's fully nude if I haven't made that clear. 

14. There is a no cell phone use policy, which I had no idea they would enforce. 

15. Punishment for using cell phone: The most twinkish dancer among them came over and started grinding in my crotch with his ass. Like........ yeah. If that wasn't bad enough, he kept screaming "Pull my hair!" Dude. "Don't call me dude!" Sorry, Dude. "Don't call me dude!!!" "Smack my ass!" 

16. They make straight dudes pay to get in. Remedy that immediately, please. If I'm there with 2 or 7 women, and your gaydar doesn't go off, hook a brother up. 

*Just kidding middle America.

Saturday night, no reservation, my choice was to wait 45 minutes for a table or take a table in the bar.  I opted for the bar.  I should have waited or went somewhere else.

I had eaten at Roy's in Philadelphia, which was an awesome experience.  I expected that same in Scottsdale.  Didn't happen.

I started out with my favorite drink, an Original Hawaiian Martini.  They are not cheap with the alcohol in the drink, it's very potent.  For dinner, I opted for choices on the Prix Fix menu.  My starter was a Hawaiian Crunch Winter roll.  It was great, made with shrimp tempura and avocado.  For my entree, I selected the Panang-style tiger shrimp with vegetable coconut curry and jasmine rice.  Very good combination of flavors, but could have been served a little warmer.  Dessert was the always awesome "Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle".  This dessert is always to die for.  It's the best  dessert I have ever had anywhere!!

Other than the slightly cold entree, the thing that amazed me about this restaurant was the fact that the staff didn't intercede when a nearby customer managed to annoy me all evening long.  This guy was in the restaurant bar, supposedly waiting for his brother.  Well, I was there for over an hour and the brother never showed up.  Go figure.  But, in the meantime, this guy managed to annoy me, tell me strange stories, sit at my table (until I asked him to leave), go back to this table, remove papers from his bag, bring them back to my table and spread them out, (until I asked him to leave again), used my cell phone to call his brother, mother, sister, god knows who else.  But at least while he was on my cell phone, he wasn't bothering me.  He even begged me for a ride and helped himself to some of my food.  You get the picture.  I can not believe that the staff allowed this to happen.  It's outrageous.  Other customers noticed, I guess I should have demanded to speak to a manager to have situation resolved, but I didn't want to make a scene.  I couldn't believe it was happening or that is was allowed to happen!!!  I even had to sneak out a side door when this nut wasn't looking, so he wouldn't follow me.  Completely nuts.  I think a restaurant of this caliber has an obligation to protect it's customers.

John Mull's Meats also does BBQ catering under Road KIll Grill. 2008 Taste & Sounds of Soul Winner.

I ventured downtown to the Taste & Sounds of Soul Friday & Saturday to indulge in some good bbq and soul food.

Friday night was a packed house with long lines and a huge crowd enjoying the entertainment on the main stage at Fitzgerald's.

I walked up & down the tent area of vendors and there was about 8-10 food vendors serving bbw,asian,seafood gumbo,turkey legs,giant cajun shrimp,fried catfish,shrimp and hushpuppies,funnel cakes and lots of pies and cakes.

The lines were outrageous. H&H Bar-B-Q with a big red smoker trailer had a line of 50+ people about 75 yards long the longest by far.

Phat Katz BBQ had 30-40 people waiting. Usually long lines and full parking lots are a sign of excellent food, service,etc.

This would not be the case here.

Road Kill Grill was the 1st stand in the food court and the line was short because it moved rapidly.
I had the 5-bonz/w tips rib dinner w/2 sides for $10-I had mac n cheese and macaroni salad. I also ordered 2 sandwiches-a pulled pork and a beef brisket. SOdas were $1.

The ribs were rub no sauce. Nice smoky taste very tender and very meaty. the tips were the best. juicy and oh so yummy.

The mac n cheese was better than I've found at any storefront BBq and the macaroni salad was great too.

The pork sandwich was great, sauce had a little zip and the bread was very fresh and quite remarkable.

The beef brisket was some of the best I've had could've used a little crust & rub but very juicy & tender. Sauce on the side.

I wish they had a stand at Lowe's or Home Depot or something because this guy knows his BBQ.

Originally I was just gonna get some chips and soda from the 76 convenience store when I just happened to notice this Burger Brothers sign to the right of the entrance. Didn't think much of it until the aroma of sizzling beef, onions, and french fries took a hold of my nose and started pulling me towards it just like in the cartoons.

First of all, the place itself is really tiny, but my nose and my stomach did not care at that moment. The fact that it was part of a gas station didn't bother me either. 

After seeing the menu, it's not hard to decide what to get. You can order a basic burger for about 5 bucks which comes with a quarter pound patty, lettuce, tomato, onions (grilled, regular or both), pickles, and your choice of either mayo or spicy chipotle mayo. For an extra charge you each you can add a fried egg, bacon, cheese, or sauted mushrooms.

For 2.25 you can get a basket of fries which are big enough for 2 people. Just so you know these fries are fresh cut with the skin on and it goes straight to the fryer. You receive it sprinkled with a special kind of salt seasoning which kind of reminds me of the seasoning they use at Red Robin on their steak fries. Once you start eating them, you will know right away that it was a whole potato just minutes ago.

What I ended up getting was the #1 combo which was just your basic burger with both kinds of onions and the spicy chipotle mayo. It comes with fries and a drink which I paid a total of 7.88 with tax. Now some places, like Five Guys or Fat Burger, you are looking at about 10 bucks easy. If you are just gonna get the burger with fries, you might as well get the combo because its about the same price but the only difference is you get a drink so that's a good deal.

Honestly, I can probably eat two of those burgers just to fill me up but the fries themselves helped take care of that. I could only eat half of it and ended up taking it with me in the car. Ironically, when I was at a stoplight going towards my next destination, there was a homeless man on the corner holding up a hungry sign. So I gave him the fries. I guarantee you he was more than happy to accept it. It was a win-win for both of us.

Besides their namesake, they also have other items there like Philly Cheesesteaks, Hotwings, Chicken Sandwiches, and Onion Rings. Did I mention their ranch sauce is like liquid crack? Once you taste it, you just might start twitching due to withdrawals from not having it since you will be coming more often to this place. Im not really a ranch person so im not worried about it. *right shoulder starts twitching. 

Hours are Sunday through Thursday 11 am to 10 pm. Friday through Saturday 11 am to 11 pm. They take cards and I don't remember if there was a minimum or an extra charge for convenience.

So overall, Burger Brothers will be a normal rotation in my lunch schedule any time im in the area.

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

I was recently introduced to Scottsdale BBQ Co by fellow Yelpers who Know Their Food.  As I enjoyed my juicy burger that day, I knew two things to be true: 1) this place would make a great lunch spot for my perpetually hungry co-workers (guys like BBQ, what can I say?), and 2) I could not die happy without trying the tri tip sirloin sandwich.  So, back at the office I warned everyone to break out their "big stretchy pants" and get ready for a field trip to Fantastic BBQ Land.

We piled in on a Friday ready to EAT.  Right off, everyone appreciated the down-home, no-frills feel, complete with a loud screen door, gingham tablecloths and the specials listed out on a chalkboard.  After chatting with the owner (who is super cool, by the way) we all ended up with either tri-tip sirloin or pulled pork sandwiches, all with the most amazing spicy BBQ sauce you will ever taste.

I had the sirloin tri-tip I had been thinking about since my last visit.  So worth waiting for!  Huge - I couldn't finish it (and I really, really tried).  My side, of course, was mac n cheese which I promptly decorated with Tabasco.  Mac n cheese o' fire!  Others had baked beans, potato salad, mac n cheese sans tabasco (silly boys, afraid of the burn...), and caesar salad.  The caesar looked especially good, with nice slivers of parmesan gracing the top.  I stole a few.  Ok, more than a few... 

All in all, everyone walked out happy (and ready for a nap!).  It was a messy, good, 6-napkin per person experience.

***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***

Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.

In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).

I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:

(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).

(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.

(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.

The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.

(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.

(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.

(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.

The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.

(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).

The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).

(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.

There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.

In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).

For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.

Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.

Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).

I'm jumping on the Yonaka bandwagon. I have been dying to try the place since before they even opened. Driving past the restaurant for months, I never got the chance to eat here. Finally, I dragged my mom along for Happy Hour and I'm absolutely sold. 

Every bite I had was absolute heaven. We started with a cucumber amuse that was very refreshing. Every description sounded great but we narrowed it down to a few choices that we shared. 

Beet Fries - Great flavor and texture. I'm not typically a fan of beets, but these were really delicious. 

Brussel Sprouts - An absolute must for me whenever they're offered on a menu and these did not disappoint. I see myself ordering these every time I come.

Avocado Nigiri - My mom's favorite of the evening. The flavors were amazing and all the sauces complemented and enhanced the flavor of the avocado superbly and it was beatifully presented with an edible flower. 

Kaki-age - Not a showstopper dish, but once you dip the tempura into the sauce they provide, it was quite flavorful.

Sake orenji - The salmon was great. The subtle flavor or orange and roe really made the dish sing. 

Watermelon salad - Absolutely amazing. The little bites of watermelon exploded with flavor and definitely pack a punch. One of my favorite flavors of the evening. I could eat this all day long. 

Karaage - Different than any other version I've had. Probably my least favorite dish. Just a little too sweet for me, but the chicken was perfectly cooked and had great flavor. 

Overall, I have to say this place surpassed my very high expectations. The menu is inventive and takes lots of risks and most of them pay off. Not to mention the prices are fantastic and service was attentive and friendly. We left full and satisfied for a very low price. I am already planning my return and expect to be a regular for Happy Hour.

***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.

Mi Comida was the place picked for the International Supper Club UYE for September and I for one was excited to try them out!

As others have stated this place is small, and if you are in a hurry, then skip it all together.  With that being said, we all arrived around the same time, and Carlos, who I guess is the owner, waited on us, and I have to say Carlos was amazing, gave us all personal attention, took each person's order one at a time and yes the dishes came out that way as well. But I have to say this was one of the best dinning experiences I have had in a very long time. I enjoyed the fact that we were not rushed and that we all were able to carry on a conversation and enjoy some great food! So if you are not in a hurry and are looking for great personal service, this is your place!

I knew before I got there I wanted tamales! I have been craving tamales, but I didn't want the normal run of the mill tamales!  I ordered Tamale de papa, which on the menu said its made in the highlands of Ecuador, it was made with a potato cheese dough (hello this Irish girl loves potatoes!!) and it was filled with chicken, veggies and a slice of chorizo wrapped in a banana leaf, it was pretty darn tasty! Really enjoyed it!

I also ordered the Pastel Crillo De Pollo - chicken, veggies and aji chilli wrapped inside a pastry puff, this too was delish!!    I crave/love spicy foods, and Carlos brought out some aji sauce and said that it was spicy, for me, it was lacking the heat, but made up for the amazing flavor it had. That stuff is delish! 

Impeccable service, excellent food, amazing company, hope to be back soon!

Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

Trust..

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

Sprinkles is at The Linq (between the Flamingo and the Quad). Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. 

I just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a "Doggie Cupcake" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a "Lemon Meringue" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. 

There is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. 

Hours:
Sunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am
Thursday - Saturday 10 am to 1 am

I haven't been back in months.  The last time I went, the man next to me dripped so much sweat, the droplets invaded my space-- I couldn't do my own moves for fear of getting his perspiration on me.  Hey, if the guy was a hottie, I may have not minded half as much... ;)  The room stank like used gym socks and wet leather, and sour anti-perspirant, as well- ugh! 

I asked Beth, the owner, if she would ask the male patrons to wear a shirt and not go topless.  She replied that she really couldn't tell people what to wear.  I said it's not telling people what kinds of clothing to wear (i.e. styles), but that men should at least WEAR a shirt, something to catch their perspiration and keep it from splashing all over.  (Something to keep their scraggly hair in place would keep perspiration from the head from spraying onto someone else's space, as well.)  I see the women wearing all sorts of shirts (tees, racerbacks, yoga tops, midriffs, etc) that allow them to feel most comfortable in such heated space, and the result is that I don't see any of their sweat invading the spaces of their neighbors.  Beth said she'd post something in the next newsletter suggesting that the men wear shirts, but after reading about four consecutive newsletters and seeing nothing written regarding my request, I gave up.  

I guess my observations/suggestions didn't matter anymore since I'd signed up and paid for the next 25 passes.  It's been four months since my last conversation with Beth (I searched for my last Yelp check-in), and I still have 21 unused passes set to expire on July 24, 2012.
---
7/9/12

Beth Beary contacted me via Yelp email to let me know that she's extended the expiration date of my passes and asked me to not let one experience take my yoga practice away.  It was a good point, and I wrote her a note thanking her for the extension.  She's since posted a message (read below) reiterating what she told me, with the addition of her reason of not telling her patrons what to wear-- that due to the nature of the practice, she did not want people to overheat.  Are we women therefore S.O.L. because we cannot go topless, because that would be public indecency?  Have you seen many of the women who come to practice (most are lean and fit)?  Have you seen some of the men who come to your clinic??  Hmm...  As I've noted before, the female yogis show up wearing different styles, and the clothing helps to keep perspiration from splashing all over the place.  If you would just discontinue allowing the men to go topless, I guarantee you will find more practitioners staying on.  (I know of a former Floo-id practitioner who stopped going bec. of similar reasons I mentioned, and if she and I felt this way, then we can't be the only ones.)

Technically, you may fit 60 people in that room, but in a heated space and many bodies (of all shapes and sizes) present, people like their spaces and want to leave some room to allow themselves to be able to move their arms freely without hitting their neighbors.  Furthermore, once a class is underway, it usually is quite disruptive for someone to stop, pick up their mat, towel/s, and water bottle to find another space elsewhere.  Most of the classes I've attended here became very full and allowed just enough space for movement-- some of us have had to stagger our mats so as to allow limbs to move around without someone getting poked in the eye!  I find it ridiculous and somewhat condescending to say that the option of moving is available...

Country Diner alert!!  All your breakfast  and lunch diner favorites !  We have passed this place literally a million times and kept wondering what the food is like.  Well we wonder no more.  For lunch today we stepped into a bit of what reminds me of an Oklahoma Diner , I could almost see my  country country cousins stopping by this place.  The menu is full of classic sandwiches like French Dip, Monte Cristo, Hamburgers and other American Sandwich Staples.  The menu is big on Breakfast and has lots of Omelettes to chose from .They even mark all the low carb items so you for those South Beachers it's a little easier. 

For starters Linda our server was instantly like family, she was sweet and kind . I love the way she talked to my daughter like she already knew her , "So Sammy what are we having today?" Linda was extra helpful and made great recommendations  .She even warned us about the size of portions and boy she wasn't kidding. Linda did a great job keeping glasses full and prompt service. We noticed in this small establishment  there  were four servers , whoa that's rare these days. 

I had the avocado Omelette which is big , with super nice chunks of avocado , no salsa  but I never asked for any either. The hash browns were not my favorite style  more mashed than chunky but you decide. You can chose yummy fresh made daily biscuits or toast. 

Plus One( husband) had the  Prime rib and eggs breakfast which he couldn't finish. The prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good, considering we are in a diner.  This is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it's perfect. This also comes with hash browns, eggs, and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy. If I wasn't low carbing it that would have been lunch! 

The decor is cute and quaint. The care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.They talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were. When you are passing thru No Pho   give them a try.  They are open for  lunch and breakfast  only.

Let me preface this with the crucial fact that I have not yet been to Hakkasan. But let me follow with two words that explain this 1 star rating: customer service. 

Everyone working in this industry should know and value the importance of customer service, especially in Las Vegas. People travel from all parts of the world to enjoy an extravagant weekend in the one&only Sin City. So to be mistreated, disrespected, and borderline harassed before even starting a vacation is unacceptable. 

Let me explain. 

I go to Vegas a lot. And I know a wonderful promoter who always hooks it up. She doesn't work for Hakkasan, so we went through a different promoter that my friend got the number for. Dan. He told us that our guys would have to pay - and that's fine. We understood, but didn't want to go to Hakkasan and pay over going to XS for free. 

The text my friend sent was incredibly polite: 

"hi sorry I think we're gonna pass cause we can get the guys into the other clubs for free. thanks anyway tho! I'll text you in the future :)"

Among other things, he responded with this:

"Ur gonna favor free & have an experience prob bad because we dominate sundays vs. having time of your life which is ur coming to Vegas." 

"whoever u talking to is miss leading you" because XS charging is "commonly known"

and repeatedly said that Hakkasan was the #1 club in the country. 

1) No need to put down other clubs or the fact that our guys don't want to pay
2) Don't tell us we won't have fun unless we come to your club
3) It's not all about being voted number 1 by a magazine, it's about customer service and relations and in the few months that Hakkasan has been open, they can't even beat a subpar tier 3 Vegas club on Yelp - that's probably due to poor customer service.

If this club expects to compete with XS, Marquee, & Surrender once the hype has died down, they should reevaluate how they treat potential guests at their club. 

I still plan on going to Hakkasan and I do look forward to seeing what all the hype is about. I believe that the owner of the club and those working have put a lot of hard work into making a new and exciting atmosphere for EDM lovers. But until I see for myself, my only impression of the club is through our interactions with the club's promoter - whose role is to represent and "promote" the club. Instead, his aggressive assertion of Hakkasan's superiority to all other clubs in Vegas and condescending response at our polite refusal of his offer left a bad taste in my mouth.

A chip collector?   Are you a gambler?  A semi pro Vegas historian?

Then Spinettis is the shop for you.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WCyD3030jgcUJSpCJ-jgig&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

I have a friend who is an avid chip collector, he has cases of them, really cool display. He asked me to call him from Spinettis and let him talk to the guy there. Happy to help a friend in need.  I watched the guy started pulling a bunch of old $5 chips from the case and handed me back the phone. "Are there 17of them" my friend asked? I counted..1.2.3.4... Yup. " OK pay him $425 for the lot". WTF I thought for less than $100 wort of chips! My friend is a nut!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinettis-home-gaming-supplies-las-vegas-2#TeeFv031vYLnN7cmjtNqDA

But as I looked at the chips and the hundreds of others I could see the appeal. These were some pretty unique chips with some cool artwork. I liked an Elvis one the best.

The guy working the chips was very nice and must really know his stuff, I certainly got a education on the chip collection game. He told me there are people with thousands of them and some go for mega bucks (thousands!). Sorry I left camera in the store. Borrowed these.

They got other stuff for collectors from ash trays to dice to cards from various LV casinos. 

They also have anything you may need to transform your house into a mini casino. Tables, chips, cards, dice, shufflers even bingo supplies, so rush on over there and get yourself in on some of the lucrative casino bucks. Why should Italians and Indians have all the fun?

So if collecting stuff like this floats your boat give this place a try, I'm sure you can find something for your collection too.

Holy my Moly. This is another restaurant that gets me hard.

District One is a hidden gem. I typically visit this establishment at least once for all my trips to vegas. In fact, its the first place that I stop by when I drive to Vegas from Cali. Food/Eating taking priority over Partying/Drinking...what is going on?? Yah its that guud! Its known as the "new Go-To spot" for all people of Las Vegas. I love PHO. I REALLY DO LOVE PHO. Simple, light, and delicious. What originally caught my attention about this restaurant was that they had OXTAIL pho and BONE MARROW pho. WHAT?? Yes...an oxtail where the meat falls right off the bone like butter and a delicious bone marrow with TONS and TONS of tendon. The sight of the bone marrow and oxtail makes all foodies say the 3 magic letters: O, M, G.  The protein and meats were absolutely delicious. The noodles were perfect and weren't too soggy and the basil and leaves were fresh to perfection.

(Fun Fact: Tendon is high in protein and low in fat)

Anywho...

When Im intoxicated beyond belief, or when I have any sort of alcohol in my system, the number 1 thing I crave is Soup and Noodles, in particular: PHO. And when Im hungover as hell the next morning, my number 1 cure is PHO. Being drunk in Las Vegas is fun, but being drunk w/o any delicious food to be consumed sucks. I wish there was a 24/7 buffet. Tacos El Gordos isn't as great as the original location in SD. Steak and Eggs for some cheap price just doesn't cut it. Earl of Sandwich gets boring. And who wants to pay for overpriced room service?? 

PHO is my answer! Another cool thing about this place is that its open till 3 AM. And another cool thing about this location is that they serve lots and lots of craft Beers. I had a Soba Ale created by Chef Morimoto...this is an ABSOLUTE MUST TRY!

If your drunk, or if your looking for a place with great Vietnamese food, come out to District One. This place has a 4.5 star rating for a reason! This is a must-visit for all foodies, especially those people (*cough asians) who love to take pictures of their own food. This Bone Marrow is a must-see-in-person type of deal! This place gets me hard, and I love everything about this restaurant, everything from the customer service, to meeting the managers, to the decor, and the plating.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^

Seven adult Yelpers and two young ones got together yesterday to give the new restaurant a go.  Opened just a week, the place has a winning combination of choices and flavors.

The Radar O'Reilly of our group (that's meant in the kindest way) had emailed the restaurant and arranged our tasting session picking from the most common dishes selected by the group.  It was a great idea in theory and execution.  Just as Radar procured things the 4077th needed, our Radar arranged our brunch perfectly.

We ordered:  bacon cheddar biscuits with honey salt butter; country house pt with pickles, fruit mostarda, and grilled bread; Cheesy garlic toast made with four cheeses; pimento cheese with Saltines, pretzel chips,and  breakfast radishes; smokey bleu cheese fondue with salt and pepper chips; black mission figs with goat cheese, pistachios, pomegranate seeds, and arugula; baked artichoke with Freekeh stuffing; dirty mac and cheese with burnt pork ends, four cheeses and Ritz cracker crust; butcher style chicken wings the menu describes as hot smoked, flash fried, salt & vinegar, sriracha. Buffalo or BBQ; bacon and eggs with thick bacon, deviled eggs, red onion jam and multi grain toast; breakfast poutine with two poached eggs on top of fries with turkey gravy and cheese curds; doughnut holes with dusted with cinnamon and served with a berry dip; load S'mores nachos made with graham crackers, torched marshmallows, toasted walnuts, Oreo cookie crumbs, chocolate sauce, and fluff cream; and last, banana pudding with Nilla wafers, salted caramel, and whipped cream.

The foods were all good.  My favorites would be the bleu cheese fondue, the pt, the bacon and eggs, breakfast poutine, and the cheddar bacon biscuits.  I'd go back alone and have just the bleu cheese fondue and the poutine.  If the skillet with the leftover bleu cheese had fit in my pocket without spilling, it would be sitting in my kitchen, empty and clean.  I thought if I walked through Tivoli Village just holding it upright, people might think I was panhandling--literally and figuratively.  The poutine was excellent and now I know why might Canadian friends rave!  The desserts were excellent, too, but of the three, get the S'mores nachos.

Service was superb throughout!  Chef Canteenwalla came to our table and spent a good amount of time with us explaining the restaurant and the concepts behind it.  We had a group photo taken with him and he was very outgoing!

This is a wonderful new restaurant on the West side and they have their good game on even though they've been open for just a week.  I can't wait to go back.  Fondue, you're mine!

Eight of us came to this Ethiopian restaurant for dinner during Restaurant Week. Among all participating restaurants, we made the decision on Lalibela based on the strength of the prix fixe menu, availability of vegetarian and gluten-free options, and price.

We were seated immediately upon arrival and the interior was well lit, spacious, and clean. The seating arrangement started with a score of smaller tables that led to ours in the back. The vibe was casual and appropriate for groups of all sizes. 

My choice of appetizer, the Beet and Potato Salad, was a wonderful starter. The mix of chunky beet and potato came with great texture underscored by a light lemon vinaigrette flavor. This is one item I haven't had at Ethiopian restaurants, but it's something I would order again.

The main entre came with two forms of beef stews; pan-fried beef, chicken stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, salad, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. They were served on a bed of fluffy injera with just the right amount of sourness. I was addicted to the softness of the injera, and they were generous to replenish them whenever it was needed. 

The beef items were cut too small, but the spiciness was on point with purpose. The chicken needed to come with an egg, but the vegetarian platter was truly delicious. All the flavors were discernible, unlike some of the Ethiopian restaurants where the seasoning began to taste in uniform after a while. I particularly loved the spicy beef stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. My dinner companions really enjoyed their food as well.

For dessert, my choice of Mango Mousse Cake was a hit. Plating was not particularly striking but everyone raved about it once I passed around the table. It came with an intense mango flavor, soft custard-like texture, and a smooth refined finish. 

The restaurant became extremely busy by the time we left. And, for $15, the meal was a fantastic deal. I still think the execution was not as sophisticated as Awash, Meskerem, or Abyssinia, but when price and value are considered, this place can certainly go toe to toe with some of the better places around the country. Service was slow, but knowledgeable, responsive, and friendly. Interested diners should expect a good level of authenticity when it comes to the seasoning. Those interested should also be aware of their large portions--so be ready to take some of the food home. I'd be very interested in coming back for another feast.

4.5 stars 

Oh Tottie's. I think I love you because our names are similar... Beyond that, you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service! 

The first time I went to Tottie's it was for my Favorite Bear's birthday party. I arrived before Happy Hour ended and scored a Sake Bomber (or two?) before we were seated for dinner. I let the birthday boy handle all of the ordering. He knows what I like! I don't remember exactly what all we had but I do know that I want an IV drip of her curry sauce in my arm at all times. I also enjoyed her pork belly lettuce cups. Yep, PORK BELLY. It was so good! 

The second visit I had, I ordered a duck with creamy curry noodle dish. It was not on the menu, and you're lucky if you can get it, but if you do, I wouldn't mind if you named your next child after me. You're welcome. The duck was tender and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the most delicious creamy, spicy curry sauce. I could eat it every day. Seriously. During our meal, our server was friendly but a little absentminded. She also seemed like she was new because she wasn't terribly knowledgeable on the menu. At the end of my meal, Tottie asked me about my food and thanked me for coming in. 

I am looking forward to my next visit to Tottie's The food is great, the servings are huge, the prices are reasonable. I know 5 stars from me is in their future!

Oh, the balls!!! Those sauerkraut balls! Why not start off by talking about those delicious fried, cheesy, homemade sauerkraut filled balls! I could start a whole Schweaty Balls type commentary on them, they were that good.

It's no surprise, considering Butterjoint is connected with Legume, the equally as amazing restaurant next door. The bar is pretty much the same as it was before. Still dark, romantic and cozy, but with an expanded drink and appetizer menu. Brilliant move on their part because they'll attract people to the bar casually, then suck them in for the promise of delicious food next door!

For my drink I went with my old favorite, the Papa Dob, which had Mt. Gay Eclipse Rum, Maraschino Liqueur, grapefruit and lime. I just can't get away from a drink with grapefruit. It's so refreshing, and this certainly did the trick. I also enjoy these well made cocktails because, although it's quite small, it's strong and meant to be sipped. Rather than a mixed drink thrown together at an average run of the mill bar that you suck down in five seconds because there's no liquor in it. No thanks.

We also ordered up the pierogie appetizer. Also, accompanied by homemade sauerkraut, which is the perfect blend of sweet and sour. The pierogies are made in house as well, and were crispy, but not burnt, filled with a potato and cheese blend that combined the best of two fine ingredients.

See, they hook you in. Because it made me think... "Rachel, you must head back to Legume, stat!" It did the trick simple as that, all it took were some tasty balls!

Me and the wifey met up with Bethany E and her hubby Mike for lunch on a Sunday just right after they opened which was 12 pm. Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.

We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.

What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). 

As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!

What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.

Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. 

Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!

If you are thinking of trying Mundo for the first time, please read
this. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.
Unfortunately we weren't able to try the food because we were verbally
attacked by the owner, Mingo Collaso, so this review is for the
experience only. Here's what happened.

My husband and I (we are locals) called the restaurant at 3 pm, asking
if they were still serving lunch. The host was very sweet and polite
and said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had a
baby in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.

We arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I had
called, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHER
PERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. We
sat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered a
cocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. The
baby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food on
its way- so far so good.

Then a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, "I
want you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but children
are not allowed in the restaurant." I looked at him with a confused look,
since we had been seated there by the host, and said, "Well, I called
ahead and asked--" and he interrupted me and said, "I don't care. Like
I said, there's nothing I can do about it now." I said, "are you
asking us to leave?" and he responded again, "I don't care."

I asked him, "Why are you treating us this way? Why are you being so
rude?" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and I
pointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant and
we had called and asked. He repeated, "I don't care," and turned on
his heels and stormed OUT of the restaurant.

We were shocked. I have never been treated this badly in a restaurant
in my life. I worked in the service industry for ten years and have
never seen anyone treated like this. We had called ahead about the
baby, arrived when not a single person was there, ordered drinks and
food, and were suddenly attacked by the owner. I felt like I got
punched in the face.

He was obviously mad at his staff for allowing us in and behaved like
a child by taking it out on us. I will strongly advise anyone who
wants a positive service experience to not go to Mundo. The owner is
unprofessional, unkind, and rude. I literally left in tears thanks to him.

Pawn Shop or Tourist Attraction?

As someone who frequently seeks out cultural memorabilia in pawn shops and thrift stores, I have always found Las Vegas to be a treasure trove.  In fact, before the show Pawn Stars (of which I am a fan) premiered, I went into Gold and Silver Pawn several times and even purchased a few items from them.

But, the success of the show, as can be expected, has changed Gold and Silver Pawn quite dramatically. Now, if you go to the shop, as so many do, expect to wait in line for quite a long time to get inside. If you're lucky, and you drive by the shop at just the right time, you may be able to get in without waiting in line. But, that is very rare. 

Also, once inside, don't expect to see only a few customers as is depicted on T.V.  It is pretty much always filled with a line of tourists walking their way through the shop, asking to see items that were purchased on the show. Which they never seem to have...

Some people comment about the lack of congenial service. The people who say this have, most likely, never been into an actual pawn shop. The employees are not there to be friendly, they are there to make money.  And, I can imagine it gets pretty annoying to constantly be asked, "Where's the Old Man or where's Chumlee?" 

The thing about Gold and Silver Pawn is you must understand what you're getting into before you go there. Number one, expect a line -- both inside and out. Number two, you may, but you probably won't, see any of the show's cast members. Finally, (no disrespect intended), but if you actually want to buy or sell something at a pawn shop in Las Vegas, it is probably best to go to one of the other pawn shops in the area that are not dominated by the tourist trade.

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.

***We had a large party menu (fixed) at Tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a PF Chang's***

Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.

Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.

Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.

Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.

As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.

Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.

Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking.

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

Pre-fixe single menu + 12 seats. I'm not uber head over heals in love but Omae serves some pretty good stuff. Plus, it's so affordable it's worth at least 1 visit, maybe 2, or 3--really it depends on the menu. Speaking of menus... Omae, please. I generally don't carry a magnifying glass with me. USE NON-SCRIPT FONT LARGER THAN 4pt. My personal suggestion, Helvetica. A classic.

I've been here twice on two different menus. Each had a chilled soup, a vegetable course + an entree. The chilled soups here are phenomenal. If you've never had a soup cold, this would be an excellent place to start and acclimate yourself. They're vegetable based, creamy, and amazing. One had an egg custard on the bottom which was phenomenal.

The 2nd course always leaves something to be desired. Not bad just not special. Visit #1 consisted of a deconstructed shrimp salad. It was a miniature vegetable plate with a prawn for substance. Visit #2 was a half of a carmelized onion w/ miso paste. Tasty but just eh. 

Here's where your meal is either worth it, or not. If you're ordering Omurice as your entree, you just got ripped off--badly. If you order something more substantial, i.e. Ramen. It's 100% worth it to eat here. Omurice = Fried rice wrapped in egg. I've had many a fried rice(s) and Omae does not make the best. If you need fried rice in your life, holla and I'll steer you in the right direction. There was also a Wagyu burger on the menu which, while tasty, was not all that special. Personally, I''ve found that the ramen is a guaranteed delicious time as well as the only way to get your money's worth. I've had chicken and pork based ramen here and they were both excellent. Don't let a chicken-based broth frighten you. It's much richer than it sounds. They also have thicker, chewier noodles. woo.

Call and make a rez.

If your reading this your already missing out!!

Bookmarking Vila a few weeks back I finally got here to an empty restaurant! I thought it was a little strange, that was until we met the Lubka!!! That's where our experience took off!!! After being sat and shown the menus we decided to go with all recommendations from the waitress and owner.

Starting off with some great house made sangria we ordered the Portuguese Chorizo and Snails! Wow..... These 2 starters we're simply brilliant, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!!!

For our mains we ordered Portuguese Steak and Paella Portuguese style. Both were great, my favorite  had to be the Paella. It seemed a little like a southern style dish I've had before just with out the spice.

Now this is where Vila Algarve shines from the menu Desert: Mascarpone and Home Make Cake.... I don't know how to explain these 2, other than Epic!!!! I'm dead serious Epic!!! Texture, flavor and simply outstanding!! 

I would also like to say Vila is a very kid friendly restaurant with High chairs and a small menu for kids. The staff were fantastic with my one year old. Also they said they encourage people to bring along there little ones.

Also after 8pm they have some nice love music. I did say at the start of this review it was empty, once 7p came around the place started filling up quick.

This restaurant is going to take off!!! Having a very international staff and grounding in what it takes to make genuine European food, Vila Algarve is high end food with group and family like atmosphere...

The Better Half and I visited this place for the 1st time last week.  I am a huge fan!  Here's why:

- Easy access off of Harmon Ave, which is off the Strip.

- The property has two entrances on the Strip.  You can sit at a bar or slot machine and have an awesome view of the street level of the Strip.  I bet this will be a great spot on NYE!

- I love the design and decor of the property (see pics).  Chandeliers, various designs in different areas of the casino floor are very impressive.  The artwork here is great too and all over the place.....you have to see it for yourself!

- Jason the Jeweler (designer of the Lakers' 2010 Championship Ring) has a store here.

- Although we didn't eat here, the food options look great.  We want to come back and try Holsteins & STK.

- The employees are very friendly and have a great attitude.  I know they just opened and you should expect that, but believe me it's hard to find that attitude here in Vegas.

- Parking was easy.  The self-parking garage is underground and has the meters that show you how many spaces are available on each level, bonus.

- The bars & lounges here are very cool.  We had drinks at Bond and the Chandelier Lounge.  Both places were comfortable and provided great people watching seats.

Overall, we enjoyed the place and have a bunch of places we want to come back and try out.  I hope they make it in this economy.

Will I return?  Are you crazy?  Of course I will!

The Trump Hotel is a great crash pad when you're in Vegas. It being a holiday weekend, most resort/casinos on the strip were priced pretty high. However, I was able to find a great deal at Trump on Expedia for $109/night. 

We got a great room on the 57th floor facing the strip. The rooms are nicely appointed. All rooms have two doors to get through so you are away from the hallway and it's extremely quiet. There is a kitchenette that is fully stocked with a stove, microwave, fridge, toaster, blender, utensils, pots, pans, plates, pasta strainer, martini shaker and more. You can cook all your meals right inside your room, but there really isn't a grocery store nearby, so it's pretty unlikely that you will. Each room has a comfy king bed and a sofa bed so you can sleep up to 4. The bathroom has a huge jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and a tv right in the mirror. There is plenty of closet space. And there's also free wi-fi.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and you'll receive top notch service as you would expect from a luxury hotel. And that's all it really is. It is NOT a resort/casino. There are only two restaurants, one bar, a pool, spa and gift shop. Which means you'll be spending most of your time being entertained at other places. While it's located across the street from Encore/Wynn and next to the mall, it is set back from the strip, and you will end up taking taxis everywhere you go. So, on one hand, it's nice that you don't have to walk 20 minutes through a casino to get to your room, but if you're there to gamble, this is not the hotel for you.

4 stars for the value and the great customer service. Plus, they allowed early check-in and late check-out. But if you want to go all out, I'd suggest Palazzo or Encore.

Best Foot Spa really is the BEST FOOT SPA in VEGAS!
And Get your mind out of the gutter, this ain't "THAT" kinda foot spa!

After so many 5-star 100% positive reviews, I was itching for a massage. All the tension in my neck and back became so much more apparent and I was counting the seconds till I had a day off. I haven't had a massage in a year!

MASSAGE: They hit all areas of the body. Start with the shoulders, move to the head & scalp, and arms while your feet are soaking. Then off to the legs & feet. You'll flip over face down and then they'll go to town on the reverse side--neck, back, legs, the whole nine-yards. I had Song Lee (sp?) and boy did he really work my aching muscles. The rest of my body prefers a medium-firm handle. But when it comes to all the knots in my neck, shoulders, and back I really need someone to relentlessly work those puppies out. And he didn't disappoint!

OUCH: Not gonna lie, he de-knotted every muscle in my back. In the following days, the skin there is still a tad tender. But no pain, no gain. All that tension back there is gone. One thing though, the towels are kind've rough. They really need to use more fabric softener or fluffier towels. When he's using that much muscle, the towel tends to rub my sensitive skin--and not in a good way. 

CLOTHING: You'll be fully clothed. For women, I recommend wearing some type of tank top and lounging pants of a thin cotton material. The pants should be able to roll up to your knees so they can work on your feet and legs. Also, when you're covered by towels and being rubbed down, it can get a little hot. You're not taking your clothes off so wear lightweight breathable materials. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: Song Lee chimed in to make sure my comfort level was ok. I was uncomfortable during all the digging into my back but I knew I needed it--I didn't want him to let up! Next time, I'll probably ask for more neck/shoulders a little less foot. But I can't stress enough how polite and respectful he was. Rex checked me out and again, what a kind and polite person. 

PRICES: Mention Yelp, and you'll get a 10% discount.
               $34 = 60 mins (Org $38) ---I did this. Paid Credit Card. Tipped $10 cash. 
               $43 = 75 mins (Org $48)
               $52 = 90 mins (Org $58)

After such a wonderful experience, I'll be back once a month for my monthly rub-down.

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

When I was a little kid my dad would take me to Cowboy Mel's on Main and 2nd Street in downtown Anoka, MN (population 15,000). Me and Dad bonded. Mel smoked a cigar. I learned of Guns and Ammo magazine. Soon a swanky salon, called Barbie Baker Design opened on Main Street and my mom started going there. Well, I was a young, fresh, bursting at the seams, pre puberty, pre knowing I was a homo young man. One day mom asked if I wanted to get a "style cut" (WHAT IS THAT?) at Barbie Baker? I said yes. Mel was stinky and the magazine selection sucked ass. 

When we walked through the doors of Barbie Baker Design (not Salon, not Shop, but Design), the heavens opened up and the choir sang. I was in my element. Cool straight chicks and a gay receptionist named Bruce. Well. I bonded with the salon community. And ever since then enjoyed the salon experience. From Beverly Hills to Manhattan, I've had some fabulous follicle indulgences. 

Here, in Phoenix, I'm lucky enough to receive the BEST cuts from Amina at Ide Mania. Well. Today. I.Snapped. I just need a quick cut. It's July in AZ. It's like a freakin' sauna. Anything to make things cooler. 

Cut to Great Clips in a glamorous strip mall on 7th Ave and Osborn. Me entering. Nervous. Sweating. Embarrassed perhaps. 

Less than 30 minutes I left with a PERFECT summer cut. An enjoyable time with my "stylist"...I mean really there was no shampooing and she never used a scissor. But. I looked good. I mean hot even. I blew kisses at the mirror. Paid my $13 tab and threw a Lincoln her way. Yea. That's how I roll.

I love the salon experience. But I have to holla at Great Clips and the staff. Clean space. Friendly and efficient staff. And Rickie can't stop complimenting me. That is worth $13 times a hundred!

Sorry Korina.

I've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.

I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. 

All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as "Cinnamon Toast Crunch", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. 

To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.

I planned a 40th birthday Vegas trip for a friend of mine and we planned on going to see Calvin Harris at Hakkasan on Sat. night. I worked with a VIP host to get a reservation for a table for 10 people (5 couples).  He told me to arrive early, we did, he said to speak with one of his fellow hosts to get in, we did.  What ensued, was the worst experience I have ever endured at a club.

The area outside the club was a veritable zoo.  No clear lines, no clear signage of where to check in if you only had tickets, if you had nothing, and if you had a table.  I went to the side to speak with someone and he said he could not help me, but I needed to speak to the host.  It took me at least 45 min to get his attention (Greg I think). We spoke VERY briefly and I mentioned that we have a reservation for a table for 10 and he asked what our spend was. I told him it was $2k and he said to give him a minute.  He waled away for at least 30 minutes.  I grabbed him once again and asked what we need to do to get in. He said get in the other "line" which was more like an ocean of people. I asked if there was any other way and he hinted that it would take some greasing of his palm.  I collected what I thought was acceptable ($80) and offered it to him.  He looked down and asked, "what's that?" I said it was $80, he walked away.

From there, I finally decided to bite the bullet and get in the "line".  After another hour or so of madness and watching others get in randomly, we decided to leave and go to XS.  What I learned from this experience, makes me pretty sick.  First, nothing is guaranteed, no matter how much money you are planning on spending. Two, if you plan on going to this club, be prepared to pay an extra $300-$500 to bribe the host to get you in.  Now, I am all for tipping, but when you are about to spend thousands of dollars at a table to have fun for a night, there should be no need to add a bribe to that.  

I don't care if I sound naive or cheap, but that is complete BS.  People come to Vegas from all over the country and the world to experience Vegas nightlife.  If this is the norm, someone should at least tell the future guests that the only way to get in is to grease some palms with multiple Benjamins.

Lastly, to clear up any questions, they were not even letting in groups of smoking hot women.  I am at a loss.

The restaurant is now just "Fleur".... no longer Fleur de Lys, located inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel.   Fleur means flower in French, but the decor seems to be reminiscent of rustic modern, something you can find in Colorado or Minnesota.  the only "flower" i see at the entire place is the cut orchids placed in a glass container.

Instead of indulging in a huge steak dinner, H and i decided to give this place a try for their sampling menu.  As crazy as it sounds, but they offer a tasting menu called the "feast" that's meant to serve min of 6 people for $450, but large parties of 10 people have proclaimed that they cannot finish this on their own.  

MINI BITES:
the AHI TACOS ($14) were amazing!  the jalapeno on top gives it a spicy kick and the ahi was seasoned perfectly.

SHORT RIBS ($26)
ah, the price tag was a bit steep considering the size, but well worth it.  braised for many hours, it was so soft and juicy and oozing with flavor.  my fav dish of the night.

NAMPOL'S WINGS ($9)
not too novel in taste or presentation, but tasty indeed.

CEVICHE ($14)
not your typical shrimp ceviche.  i tasted oysters sitting atop a bed of guacamole.  the chips were fried perfectly and had a crunchy crisp.

MIXED GREEN SALAD ($10)  of course you need to fulfill that recommended serving of veggies for the day.

ALMOND PANNA COTTA dessert ($10)
almond cake with blackberry kalamansi sorbet.  this dish was not too sweet for a dessert.  it actually was a bit tart, which was a perfect complement to my sweet cocktails.

LIBATIONS:
FLEUR RED SANGRIA (carafe is $35)
wow, really one of the best sangria H and I ever had.  made from Malbec and Brandy infused with fresh fruits and spice.   it really creeps up on you, too.

DECADENT FLIGHT ($18 for trio of 3 cocktails)
white chocolate, chocolate coconut, and expresso martini.  
Really tastes like a dessert, a little bit sweet, but the presentation was gorgeous.  my fav of the 3 was the white chocolate.  however, i would order this again just bc i love the diversity of flavors.  after all, this is a "tasting menu" type of establishment, isn't it?

SERVICE:
was questionable at first, but when we requested a new server, the night turned out ten times better!   

one of the best dining experiences of our entire trip.  highly recommend!

**Review #600: The single best meal I've ever experienced**

To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my wife and I ate a feast fit for  royalty at Chef Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. 

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house. 

The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.  Ready?? Here we go;

Course 1- The Warm UP:
Warm Bread Topped W/ Sea Salt http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=znEnAclXg1MNjKCJeOx-pQ
Hand-Cut Wagyu Tartare W/ Crostini's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=fj1hBPNx1ThYjbERN_oP1A
Italian Buffalo Mozzarella W/ Hazelnuts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=ez6IfEHvTLkw_ZHbnPA7bw
Warm Frise Salad W/ Farm Egg & Smoked Bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=Pqk4fkL90wXkwCOPKoH98g
Persian Cucumber Salad W/ Watercress & Ginger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=nUPJ-jjn7ut8ZIHqvkJH9Q

Course 2- MEAT & Sides:
Wagyu Ribeye http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=RNZ8C5u8kPgAgfK1WNoGQg OR http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=SCt7Wm5KPQ3nUoYY8ff3bw
Wagyu Filet http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=UcUtMUma-abAEqeJJF7YsA OR http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=0W_eD2OMgIgIy6D0WPrlLA
Yukon Gold Potato Puree W/ Chives http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=HM1EcDG60PgkrUeCMoDxow
Brussels Sprouts W/ Smoked Bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=Zgjpe4i2DSMbof64EhjJqA
Butternut Squash W/ A Maple Bourbon Glaze http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=WoM4UglD5nnYyT144_IW5A

Course 3- My Favorite Stuff:
Cinnamon Monkey Bread W/ Brown Sugar Sour Cream Ice Cream & Pecan Toffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=12a18ImEp5GMU4k417Nt0Q 
Guava Sorbet & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=_vXAXf8OBLrJBrVgAS_02A 
Flourless Chocolate Cake W/ Blood Orange Sorbet & Tangerines http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=c0AWtBt9_3y1-WoR_BXkAA
Farmers Market Fruit Plate  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=iPcZn31A-sZQZdAPIT5Yzw

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING we ate was phenomenal. Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. 
My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frise salad.
My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). 
My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.

The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.  

The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. 

If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.

I love social media. 

Not.

I've been coming here for over six years and found Mike who manages this Leslie's location to be the best. He knew all his customers, knew their likes and dislikes and always went the extra mile to make them happy. 

Well, along comes a new customer who tries to return something that has been opened without a receipt.  Now Mike doesn't make the rules at Leslie's, he just follows them and says, sorry but without a receipt the best he can do is an exchange. 

Well this customer isn't happy about that and takes to social media and writes a very long One Star review, about how terrible he has been treated. Btw, I see now it's been abridged to a few sentences

Guess what, after nearly twenty years, Leslie fires Mike. Now, I don't know Mike personally, I don't have his cell. But I read the review and decided to come in to tell him not worry about it. He was only doing his job. Well, no Mike. I'm told he was let go because of the incident 

Well Congratulations new Yelp'er, you got someone fired. Nice!

Now here's my story. I came in three weeks ago for some sand for my pool filter. The new Manager Peggy says Leslie's is running a 20% off special and they'll replace and install my sand for $180. Well it sounded too good, so I tell her I'm going to think about it and may I get back to her? No problem, the offer is good until Labor Day. 

Guess what?  I come back last weekend and Peggy is gone, been replaced by a really nice, sharp new Manager Bru-Lynn. Seems Peggy er, is no longer with the company. 

So I tell Bru-Lynn I've decided to take the  Leslie's special and replace my sand. Guess what? Apparently there isn't a Leslie's special going on and Bru-Lynn needs to check with her Regional Supervisor to find out what to do. 

Let me be clear, Bru-Lynn is great! Love her! Think she's the best! And yes, I still wish Mike was here. 

So she checks with her Regional Supervisor and I'm told, they're really very sorry -- did I get anything in writing?

Ok, Ok, Ok another strip mall restaurant in Phoenix. I get it. We can be a fab place in a drab space. Wow, how cool, I just came up with a new motto. But let me just say, PCG, as the regs call it, is a FAB place. Voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot, PCG actually shines on many levels. Yes, the space itself is not inventive or trendy. But why do we go out to eat? Mostly for some killer ass food. Well, you got it here sister. Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija....yowzaaa yowzaa Potsie. Yummy! The tenderloin rivals Ruth's Chris and any other high end steak place. The corn cakes are, well, let's just say I'd raffle off a limb for these babies. Pot roast is right off my Momma Jo's dining room table. The pork  tenderloin entree makes Miss Piggy cry and me, well I'm weeping already. Juicy, firm white meat with amazing sides. Services runs always a Bplus to and Aplus. Waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management. I LOVE it here. Now, the space. Yes, it's a mini mall. But they've made it iintimate and not sports bar like. The gang here has made a home run on  every level. It's like coming home everytime I eat here. EAT AT PCG people. It'll give strip malls a new meaning!

Great Casino Buffet Restaurant & FREAKIN LIONS

SITREP

Every time I pop into the MGM Grand Hotel, it's a fun casual experience.

THE SETUP

I love their dining buffets because they are quick & efficient.  Lunch runs $19.99.  Dinner runs $29.99.  (I never do both on the same day since I eat like it's my only meal of the day!)

LIONS! 

The LIONS in their large area are fun to watch interact with one another and the people.  They bring a LOT of spectators who are fascinated by being so close to observe them.  But part of me feels this is not kind to them.  So I am conflicted about this to be honest.  [Update:  see note at bottom of this review about the Lions new whereabouts]  :D

SHUTTLE PICK-UP

MGM Grand is also one of the major drop-off and get-on locations for catching shuttles back and forth from Mc Carran airport.  Great place to know.

THE LOWDOWN

My casual hotel run-in / grab a bite / run-out and hit the strip place.

ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Owner Response within 24 HRS

Here is one of two messages I just received in less than 24 hours from the MGM Owners Group.  You can't see this personal message below since it's in my Yelp inbox.  However, there is a 2nd message that shows up on the Business profile attached to my review (though these messages are not viewable from one's personal Yelp profile page).  A great response below to the Lion Issue.  Now that was unlooked for!  Message begins:

March 10, 2014

Social M.
Owner

Dear Michelangelo:

Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the MGM Grand Lion Habitat. 

The MGM Grand Lion Habitat closed as part of a property wide renovation project. Head trainer Keith Evans will continue to care for the lions at his large desert compound here in Southern Nevada, where the animals have actually spent the majority of their lives. Several years ago, MGM Grand and Mr. Evans established means to ensure that the lions will receive proper care for the rest of their lives.

The lion will remain an icon and logo forever associated with the MGM Grand brand.  We truly value your comments and patronage, and look forward to serving you again in the future.

Sincerely,

I finally know the irony behind "Phoenix's most romantic restaurant." If you've ever had the pleasure of asking Yelp Talkers for a suggestion on where to take a first date, second date, anniversary date, valentines date, or date of any type where romance is foremost on your list - you may have incidentally ended up here dressed in your best duds. I fortunately, didn't fall into that particular trap, I did however, show up here cause a friend had some family in town and invited us all out to dine with her.

What fun, I thought, I'll finally get to see what all the hubbaloo is about, I finally get to experience romance at it's finest. Secretly, I never really checked the place out at all, I didn't read about it, I had no real clue as to what this place was. I always just assumed it was some weird mixture of pizza joint, strip club, and themed in hospital recovery room and left it at that. 

Boy was I wrong, and not necessarily in a good way. I will say that this is certainly an experience, one that you'll not have anywhere else, in town or out of town, except maybe unless there's another organ stop pizza somewhere. Touting the worlds largest Wurlitzer pipe organ, the name finally makes sense. Organ has nothing to do with the male organ, nothing to do with greasy pizza stopping your organs as you eat it, nothing to do with stripping, boy was I wrong, but I'm still not sure if I was wrong in a good way or bad.

Either way you 'slice' it, the pizza here is less than mediocre, but the ambiance! The ambiance less than makes up for the mediocre pizza. The thrill of pipe organs lasts only so long, and I think I clocked it at about 3 minutes and 47 seconds, but the kids all seemed to love it. I guess if you've got kids, feel like seeing the worlds largest Wurlitzer in action and in all it's glory, then you know where to go this Friday.

So Phoenix Yelpers, I hope I left you with some insight into Organ Stop Pizza and hopefully you don't get trapped in the age old Phoenix Yelp Talk question of "Where's the most romantic place to take your girl?" because unwittingly, you'll be sent here.

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I love the Swingers Club in Las Vegas. Due to the name, you'd think there was some kinky stuff going on here. But do not come here expecting your wife to get her Latin fetish out of her system, while you experience your first interracial experience since that black sock in high school.

The Swingers Club is just pure silly fun in the heart of Old Las Vegas. Come here with some friends, grab a table, order a round, and see where the night takes you. It was great way to spend the final night of my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas.

The Swingers Club has a pretty cool layout. It has a long central bar, large open dance floor, and an elevated stage. The staff is awesome. They are hardworking,  friendly, and keep your "spirits" up, in more ways than one. Due to the golf and sex theme, the men wear kilts and the girls wear school girl outfits. Please free to read that line again.

For entertainment throughout the week, they have flip cup tournaments, comedians, dueling pianos, and indoor mini golf. But I went on a Thursday, so it was karaoke night. And well, karaoke is the best way to get the party started. Well, besides cocaine. Duh.

I rocked the stage pretty damn hard. Eventually, some locals models wanted to hang out with us. And since we weren't creepy (mostly older married men and a young nerd in myself), they were willing to buy us a round or two. Not sure. I lost count. I should paid more attention to Sesame Street.

Anyway, the rest of the review I have to omit. I do not want to be part of any divorce proceedings. I guess some of my coworkers took the name of the joint literally. 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Unless I want to use the videos on my iPhone for job security.

It's a sad story that you hear every once in a while, a grand opening kick off party setting low expectations. I'm guessing they will learn to iron out the kinks here though.

With a weekend packed full of stuff scheduled through the Yelp events page, I was excited to cap off Saturday Night with a grand opening party at Gypsy Bar. We heard that theres an adult's only arcade in there, and skee ball is the wifes fave! I liked what Gypsy Bar is doing with the arcade, bar, dance club atmosphere. Apparently, so does half of sun city's most eligible bachelors; the dance floor seemed to ooze ben gay. I wasn't so excited, waiting about 10+ minutes for the bar staff to notice me standing right in front of them, waiving my arms in hopes that they would grace me with their presence. "Vodka diet, and a diet coke for the DD please" I said without hesitating; I didn't want to miss my opportunity. $10 later, I wouldn't call it a cheap drink, but I certainly am glad they didn't charge $12 to pour some kettle one into my cocktail; it's about what I was expecting.

We spent a few minutes checking everything out and another 45 minutes or so playing air hockey, skee ball, basket ball, and other games of the arcade variety. My best skee ball score was 34,000, in case you were wondering. I could have done better though, given enough time, money, and dedication to achieving the high score.

I considered busting out my uber white guy moves on the dance floor, but I wasn't really into the 80's / 90's remix the DJ was spinning. Sir mix alot isn't on my personal play list and for good reason. 

In need of some personal validation, I was bounced from the girl at the door, to the bar staff (another 10 minute wait by the way), and ultimately the maitre d' desk at Lucky Strike next door to get my CityScape parking ticket stamped. Save yourself some time and skip bouncing from staff member to staff member; go directly to Lucky Strike to get your ticket validated too.

I'll likely check them out again down the line, but I won't be running out the door to make a night of it if there's something better to do on a Friday or Saturday. 

Sorry Gypsy Bar, that's just how I saw it. Happy Yelping Phoenix.

Just got done with "lunch" at Scramble, Sunnyslope's newest breakfast spot! They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:

They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: "breaking news."

My lunchmate and I tried one of their "signature breakfast pizzas" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected. 

That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...

Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).

I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.

Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.

Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.

I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.

I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.

Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.

For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...

OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.

And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.

Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.

All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.

P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

The Outback, until recently is someplace I have never ventured out too, but then comes along this Yelp Elite Event inviting me to go down under!! Who can say no to that!!!

This was an elite only event, and I have to say, though I really like having my plus one with me, I really really appreciate having the Elite only events, it allows me to meet some new Elite members, yes there are still people I don't know, can you believe that!  And gives me time to socialize with fellow elite members I haven't seen in a while!  

Now about this event, when we checked in Lindsey handed us a Yelp Bingo Card, man I sure do love Lindsey's bingos, it is a fun great way to get to learn & know your fellow Yelp Elites! Also apon checking in we got 2 gold coins to redeem for drinks!

 After my walkabout seeing fellow Yelpers & getting my bingo board filled out, I found my way back to my table to try some of the amazing food!

My drink for the night: Aussie Rum Punch, I enjoyed this drink, and I loved the color of it too! So yummy!

Bushman 'shrooms: I love love love these mushrooms! They were so perfect!! Couldn't stop eating them!

Homemade BBQ Chip: the sauce was amazing! YUMMY!!! And if you're a chip person, you will love these homemade spuds!!

Coconut Shrimp:  OMG MY FAVORITE!!! Absolutely loved them!!! Even went scouting to see if other tables had some haha, sadly, no, everyone seemed to love them as well :)

Bloom Petals: these lil devils are so delish!!! 

Chicken Artichoke Flatbread - While the flavor of the chicken and artichoke was great, I found the flatbread to be more of a cracker texture which threw it off for me , but everyone seemed to have enjoyed it because I didn't see a plate with any left!

Thank you Outback for given us luckly Yelp Elites a chance to try out your new bar menu!! Thank you Yelp and Lindsey for another amazing party!!

Oh also Way to Go Yelp!! Right before I checked into this Event,, I noticed a fellow Yelp Elite member, who lives in Austin checked into a Yelp Outback event as well, was all excited to get the chance to say hi to  him, but come to find out he was still in Austin at his Elite event! Way to go Outback & Yelp for having simultaneous events nationwide!

Still hunting for the ultimate donut has led me to Pink Box. After consulting with fellow Yelpers, I was intrigued by this place. Apparently, PB has some of the most unique flavors of donuts in Vegas, including the maple bacon. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to check out this place because, on this day, I had a doctor's appointment that was in close proximity to Pink Box.

Pink Box is located in NW Vegas on Lake Mead Blvd and Buffalo, in the Summerlin Plaza. Since PB is located in a busy shopping center, parking here can be a little hectic.

Inside, there is a small display case where they show their products. It is a small store, but it feels very warm and inviting.

There are 3 types of donuts to choose here: Classics, Specialties, and Gourmet. Classics are your more traditional flavors, glazed, sprinkled, etc. Specialties are donuts that have a interesting, unique flavors. And Gourmets are donuts that have no rules, anything is "up for grabs". I checked out a couple from each category. (I actually chose 4, but the owner was cool enough to throw in some extras ones that I didn't have :)

Classic Vanilla Sugar: My true measuring stick for any donut is either a glazed or sugar raised. The one at PB is good. A little bit on the chewier side IMO, but good nonetheless.

Classic Blueberry Cake: This is where I think PB excels the most. Their cake donuts are Delicious!! Soft, but still had a nice chew, moist interior, and the flavors were well balanced. The blueberry flavor tasted like real ripe blueberries and was present throughout the donut.. Definitely, one of my faves here.

Specialty Sweet Potato Cake: Once again, this cake donut was another home run. It was more dense due to the sweet potatoes present, but, it was still soft and moist, and the sweet  potato flavor was present, and not overpowering.

Gourmet Campfire Smore: I liked the concept. It was a yeasted donut with a chocolate glaze, burnt marshmallows on top, and a cream filling. I thought it tasted good until the filling started overpower my mouth with sugar. I mean, this donut was SWEET!!

Gourmet Fat Elvis: It's a well known fact that Elvis loved deep -fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. PB's version used a bruleed banana on top, and a peanut butter and banana filling. Once again, it tasted good, but the filling was too overwhelmingly sweet, almost as if I stopped chewing midway through and was like, "This was pretty tough to finish..."

Gourmet Date w/ a nutty pig: This is probably the closest thing we have in Vegas to the Maple Bacon Donut that other donut shops use in different states. PB's version uses caramelized bacon, maple glaze, figs, bleu cheese, toasted almonds, and a maple filling. Couldn't really taste the bacon or the fig, but I could taste the bleu cheese and almonds, moderately. Again, the filling sort of killed it for me.

Overall, the yeasted donuts are a 3, and the cake donuts are 4.5, and the service was a 5, the owner was very helpful and generous. If they can figure out how to make their fillings less sweet, I think that the yeast donuts can go up to a 4, if not better. I was happy to try this place, but... off to the next one!!!!

I absolutely despise feeling like I've been judged not worth someone's time due to their assumptions about my financial status based on my outward appearance.
And this time it wasn't even by a girl in a G-String on a pole!

Okay, so anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm not regularly dining high on the hog, but don't the beautiful rich people slum around in workout gear sometimes, too?

So after a recent run down Central Ave, one of my K9's and I decided to partake in a little of the awesome concept Donald S calls RETOXIFYING.  A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.

It was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's "where do I go?" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.

I did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu. 

I sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.

Nothing.

With nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.

My tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.  
If I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.

Bomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.  (It IS all from South America)  Without friendly or at least minimally cordial customer service, they can stuff it up their stuffy butts.

I ended up stopping at a nasty dirty nearby Sonic (limited options due to the dog, remember) where both the order-taking electronic voice and the rollerskate-less carhop both had the decency to ask me how I was doing that day.

After picking up tickets at will-call for Absinthe, we figured "hmmmm, now where to eat?"
We were stranded on the expansive grounds at Caesar's Palace and figured the wisest choice was to check out the restaurants inside the hotel. 

That being said, we headed straight for the forum shops!
A quick stroll lead us to Wolfgang Puck's world famous Spago!

Having dined previously at the iconic Beverly Hills location, I came with an expectation of good quality food and great service. 

We were running late so we wanted a quick but tasty meal. With the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating. Within moments, we were seated and began perusing the menu. 

For appetizers, we enjoyed the oysters on a half shell. Let me tell ya, these lil' guys were fresh, plump and with the addictively tangy cocktail sauce, it was a virtual party in my mouth! Foodgasm guaranteed!

Now onto the entrees:

Spaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - I've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when I had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, I was instantly sold!  There's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! If you haven't had it fresh I strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. It's phenomenal! Each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. The richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.
And the chicken? Tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that I devoured in a flash!

Lamb Chorizo Pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  Now this was my kinda pizza pie! It was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. The lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. The chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! 

Service was prompt and friendly. Our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. We enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!

Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying I'd  definitely come back.  Hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.

Until then,

Happy Eats!

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

It's pretty close to 3.75 stars.  

They offer a few dishes most AYCE sushi joints don't like ribeye Big Wong style, fresh oysters,  and kushiyaki (meat on a stick) options like bacon wrapped scallops.  It's actually a good place to bring that one friend who dislikes sushi.  I also like the all you can drink beer/wine/sake option for $10 more but they said they're going to change it next month.  Ummm....why??  

This location used to be Kaizen and you can definitely tell from the look of the place.  Interesting mix of old and modern and the long tables definitely encourage groups to stay a while.  We sat at the bar to pick the chefs brain on recommendations.  The whole staff was Korean.  Not too much of a big deal for me.  

Sushi standouts were the halibut and super white tuna nigiri.  The chef, Alex, said it was the freshest fish they had and it was great.  There were a ton of great options if you like cream cheese, rolls deep fried or something in unagi sauce.  I am not one of those people but knock yourself out a la Drago vs Creed if you are.  Basic rolls were fine and the freshness was acceptable.    

I was really intrigued that they offered both miso and tonkotsu ramen.  I just HAD to try half a bowl of tonkotsu made by Koreans.  The noodles, broth and 2 big pieces of pork belly were pretty good but it wasn't exactly Japanese ramen.  Koramen?  Alex took pride in the fact he made the broth from scratch as he should..it was tasty but not Japanese by any means.  

Service was definitely on top of things.  There were 3 waiters checking on us throughout the meal and earned their gratuity.

4.5 stars 
Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you? 
Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars! 

I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on. 
Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had! 

The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit. 

My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect! 

I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!

The Sugar Factory is a fun little candy store and restaurant located at the Paris Hotel Casino and Resort on the Las Vegas Strip.  The restaurant is open 24/7 offering American breakfast, lunch and dinner meals along with endless decadent desserts, including specialized candy mixed drinks.  We were fortunate to grab a table by their large picture window facing The Bellagio Hotel where we could watch their water beautiful fountains dance for us every fifteen minutes.  My daughter really enjoyed that.

I ordered a cobb salad, which seemed pretty standard with romaine lettuce, roasted chicken, tomatoes, bacon and egg topped with blue cheese dressing.  It was an average sized salad, but nothing worth the hefty $16.95 price tag.  

My sour apple blow pop martini with Three Olives Bubble Gum Vodka and Apple Pucker Liquer garnished with bubble gum pop rocks complete with a sour apple blow pop originally sounded very fun and interesting on paper, but once I took a sip of it I realized that it was much too sweet (and sour) for my palette.  I would have much rather have ordered my simple, standard dirty martini, but wanted to try a candy drink since it seemed to be one of their specialty drinks.  Along with that drink came another hefty $16.00 price tag.

There were four in our party that evening, so it is safe to say that our tab sky rocketed pretty quickly with our meals and plethora of mixed drinks.

All in all a fun place to experience at least once, but I'm not sure if we'll be coming out of our way to eat here the next time that we're in town.

On a whim, and because I thought it might provide for an amusing experience, I asked my cosmetologist daughter to wax my back.  I don't think she wanted to do it, as I was immediately provided with 3 reasons why it would be more expensive for her to do it than EWC.  Hey, I wouldn't want to wax my dad's back either...

I pulled up the website to perform a little recon, and noticed first-timers get a free waxing*.  Couldn't find what the star referred to, so I gave em a a call.  For guys, the free service could consist of an ear, brow or nose wax.  Booked!

Showed up, checked in, answered a skin questionnaire and awaited my mistress of pain.  Her name was Kayla, she was petite, had striking blue/green eyes, and is a talented artist.  After verifying that she had not yet detached any of her client's epidermal layers, and she didn't plan to make me the first, I let her approach my ears for the freebie.

Totally painless.  And since I had recently shaved, she had to tweeze some of the short hairs the wax couldn't pull.  I thought "this is going to be fun" as I removed my business blue button up long sleeve.

It wasn't until the 5th or 6th strip that I started to question my decision.  Ain't no funny @#$% happening, and it was starting to sting/burn/hurt.  Found out that some guys just get up and leave part-way through a back wax.  Probably because they aren't made to pay if they capitulate to a TKO.

Kayla suggested that I go to my happy place, and continued the depilation.  I winced with each spirited yank, like a captured spy who is continually open-hand slapped while bound to a metal chair.  Kayla, sensing my distress, or maybe noticing my perspiration sopping the protective paper table lining, would place pressure on the newly follicle-free area... and darn it, that helped.

It was rough, but we got through it together.  The $58 was rendered, along with a generous tip (how much should one tip a back waxer?) and I emerged with revealing, beautiful skin... under my dress shirt.  I was strutting, glowing, and feeling fabulous!  I took those 4 steps to gorgeous, and I never looked back.

However, when I fabulously strutted at home in front of the family, I was informed that there was a line of demarcation about two inches under my neckline which stretched from shoulder to shining shoulder.  It looked like a rip-curl of hair-nastys were about to white-cap.  Guess the neck and shoulders were not part of the full-back wax.  Must remember that for next time, or as I like to call it: 4 weeks out.

See you then Kayla, and this time I wont ask you to take pics

How have I not written a review for this yet?!

This monthly food and fundraising event has been a nice treat in the Southwest area of town. In the past couple of years, it has really gotten busy though!

Once a month, usually the last Saturday, Chaiya Mediation Monastery holds this food gathering where you can grab homemade treats for $5 or less. It starts around 9 am and lasts until 12 pm or so. But these days, they run out of the popular food items way before noon. So come early if you want your pick!

You can trade your cash for tokens but it's really unnecessary now since all the vendors take cash directly.

Among my absolute favorites are:

* Burmese Tea Salad - I love Burmese Tea Salad and I have not found one restaurant in Las Vegas that makes it. (If you know otherwise, please let me know!) The only thing is that it's not a regular item there. It's only been available a few times unfortunately. (Which makes me want it even more!)

* Mango Sticky Rice - Okay, who doesn't love this Thai dessert? Sweet rice with ripe mangoes, what's not to love? However, it's a seasonal thing and they run out fast! You need to be there early to score an order.

* Pad Thai - Made to order and a bargain for the amount you get!

* Pork Satay - Made to order and $1/stick. Put your order in and come back to get it later on. Some months it's super tender, other months it's only okay.

Other food items found:

* Hainanese Chicken and Rice
* Papaya Salad (spicy!)
* Curry Puffs (You need to order these a month in advance!)
* Soups
* Chive Pancakes
* Sweet Roti Pancakes
* Desserts

I was spoiled in the beginning because the Husband would head out and pick up the food while I slept in. It was a nice treat finding all these goodies waiting for me in the kitchen. But now it's a much longer wait to get your food because it's so crowded. Nonetheless, I'm glad the monastery is getting so much business and visitors. They could probably extend the amount of food vendors each month to accommodate the demand.

Side note: Cash only. There are tables and chairs in a shaded area, but it's hard to get a spot these days.

FABU-nothing-LOUS-than-five-stars!!

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)

The BF and I were close and needed some snackies. 

We ordered a pork arepa, 2 bean and cheese empanada and mango to drink. 

The mango drink was really good. It was not too sweet, fresh and refreshing. I coulda had a few of those since it was a hot day. 

When our order came it was the wrong order. We got one meat arepa and a bean and cheese arepa so we figured maybe she didn't hear the empanada part and perhaps got us a arepa instead? Oh well, we'll eat it anyways. 

The bean and cheese was yummy with flavorful beans. The meat turned out to be beef (unless my taste buds are wonky) but it was so tender and fantastic. Normally shredded beef is somewhat stringy, but not this. I normally wouldn't order beef but here I would definitely consider it. The arepa was wonderfully crispy on the outside and had some chewiness inside that was addictive. I can eat those alone even. Don't skimp on the mustardy hot sauce and the creamy sauce as both make the arepas even better, I think! 

Eventually I guess they realized it wasn't that they got our order wrong, we got someone elses order! The guy on the grill (I'm assuming is the owner) was apologetic about it and gave us 2 bean and cheese empanadas anyways which was cool of him. It was not what I expected at all. I was thinking more like pastry dough type empanadas, but the consistency was like the breading that is around corn dogs which lead the BF and I trying to figure out how they make it. These were tasty but since I'm a Hot Dog On the Stick fan, I'm definitely ordering just a plain cheese one next time. 

Now that its hot, it's gonna suck to come visit but I definitely enjoyed that meal and want to come back again soon.

Roaring Fork, oh Roaring Fork.  How do I love thee?  Let me counts the ways....

1.....  Okay, I guess I don't really love you.  But I do like you, okay? 

First off, what an interesting location.  I could have been killed getting in the parking lot.  I had a reservation for 8:30.  No, my table wasn't ready at 8:30.  I found that very interesting because there was no one waiting in the lobby.  And wouldn't you know, they seated me by the kitchen.  Okay, folks, I know how long your food was sitting there Friday night and it's not pretty.  Their staff is like a bunch of crazy lunatics, but that's okay.

I opted for the Huckleberry Margarita, nice but nothing to write home about.  Doesn't begin to compare with Roy's signature drink, but that's for another review.

The bread basket was full of unhealthy little taste treats, I especially liked the bacon & cornmeal bombs and the buttermilk, bacon, artery cloggers.  Yum, yum, even better slathered in chipotle honey butter.  My salad was great, I opted for the wild greens disguised as the iceberg wedge.  I'm a red meat girl, so I had the 8 oz. center cut filet mignon.  Eight is too much for any girl, so I was unable to finish.  But I did order it medium and since it was barely medium rare, I did have to send it back.  Luckily, I was close to the kitchen, so the re-cook didn't take long.  The flavor of the meat wasn't really remarkable, but satisfactory.  The green chile Mac 'n' Cheese is a really great idea and something that I will try to duplicate at home.  If any of you yelpers have the recipe, I would be interested in it.  Now, I'm thinking that since I didn't finish my steak, my server deemed me not worthy of a dessert, it wasn't even offered!  But that's okay, I guess I didn't really need it.

All in all, pleasant, but nothing to write home about.

New KoMex location. Same very delicious KoMex food. 

If you haven't tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it's that good. So I'm very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn't do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it's a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It's very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.

Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.

I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I'll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.

Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.

Did I mention that they're pretty cheap in price.

On a recent foray to Sin City with my Gal Pal, Kathryn W. we decided that we were going to relax, read, eat, explore and do some retail damage.  

We zipped over to City Center and of course, with my raging Crumpet Fever, I had to stop and take in the newest boutique of this iconic designer.  

In the last few months, I have picked up several pairs of cufflinks, a wallet, and purchased a new Key Chain from their current Pin Up Girl collection.  Sultry and fun - yay! 

Many thanks to Sales Professional Chris, who was extremely polite, polished and thoughtful, without getting underfoot.   Ask for him by name; he'll take care of you.  I tried on several skirts but they did not have size 38 in stock, so he happily called the SF outpost and put several items on hold for me.  

I will be returning to Vegas at the end of the month for another adventure, so I will be sure to stop by again - there were several other items calling my name, but alas, we had dinner reservations and didn't want to be late!

The aesthetic sensibilities of Paul Smith are so spot on - the devil is in the details, and I am an unrepentant transgressor!  I love wearing my Union Jack Mini Cooper cuff links; when I want to go lean and mean, there's a spot for everything in my cardholder wallet... and the riot of colors manage to be both staid and irreverent.  

I love Paul Smith for being so on point and current without being "trendy".  There is a fantastic sharpness that is always relevant and invigorating about anything Paul Smith, whether it's a more subtle but razor smart accessory, pair of socks, beautifully fitted suit or dress.

Always a fantastic shoppe to invigorate your basics or find a statement piece that will marry happily into what you may already have in your closet.  A number of gorgeous tulip skirted dresses come to mind for the Summer Wedding Season... 

Be sure to take your time and peruse the lovely eclectica on the walls - I found that some of things my eye caught weren't even for sale, but gave me ideas for different looks and even cues for home decor.

Summary: My SO and I like to dine at Ritter's Steam Kettle in Costa Mesa, California (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritters-steam-kettle-cooking-santa-ana) and when we found out Oyster Bar was own by the same company we have to give it a try. The wait was long (1 hour 17 minute to be exact) we were behind 5 couples but it was worth it.

Food: We had Cold Seafood Combination, New England Clam Chowder, and Combo Pan Roast. It was exquisite, the food tasted phenomenal. I don't know was it because of the long wait or not but at that moment I think it taste better than Ritter's. 

Service: The Chef was awesome, just watching him prep the pan roast and constantly making sure his patron were satisfied. Nick, the server/host was a tad unprofessional. So the Chef happen to place our dish at the wrong patron, no need to raise your voice at him. The Chef job is to prep and cook not serve. He was doing you a favor, helping you out and when he place my order to the people beside me, you shouldn't have snap at him. It still amaze me how the Chef just stay mellow and apologize to you. Not to mention when you were behind, he even step outside the counter to bust the table and seat the next group. Show some appreciation man. 

Overall: I always make it a habit to go to Egg & I (http://www.yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-las-vegas) for breakfast  every time I visit Vegas and now Oyster Bar is a must also. I'm so glad Oyster Bar isn't located on the strip. Imagine if it was, I'm probably looking at half a day wait time. Then again, it is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So that's not bad.

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called "best ramen" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA! 

We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.

I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me. 

For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a "knock-off" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely true.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being true to protocol. 

Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving "curly" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso. 

The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult. 

People in Los Angeles think they know what good or "authentic" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change. We got lucky this time... and yeah, f*ck you Los Angeles!

I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very "neat/cute" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.

My favorite item was the "Pig Face" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw

We also tried the following notable things:
Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink "Hey Bartender"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.

Hands down, my absolute favorite venue in all of the Valley.

I've seen about 6 or 7 shows here now.  It's a very intimate place, where even from the seating (stadium bleachers, for reals) you are still very much "there".  Pricing, including fees, are very reasonable.  I've rarely paid over $20 for a show, and one at that price even included the artist's new album (thanks, Donovan Frankenreiter!)

The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!  

I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.

Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked...even at the end of the night.  Practically a miracle.

Staff is super friendly. Seriously.  This place has no flaws!

Parking is always an easy $5 cash payment at the lot across the street.  Easily accessible to the PHX Light Rail as well, but I've only gone that route once.

I notice most other reviews have lots of hipster references.  Can't say that I notice a huge influx of hipsters here versus other similarly sized music venues.  Could that mean that...I am.. *gasp*..a hipster myself?  Uhhh...I say nah...only because I don't own enough hats or mustache-inspired clothing/accessories to quality.  Yet.

The mistake I made coming here last night was coming alone.  I had looked at their menu and thought I'd do the omakase.  My server, Noemi, explained that omakase was meant for two people to share.  She quickly said, "We can change it and do it for 1.  How's that?"  That was quite OK with me and with that a wonderful meal began.

After being brought some iced green tea, Noemi brought an amuse-bouche of some thinly sliced pickled cucumber wrapped with pickled papaya and topped with feta cheese.  What a grand way to start.  The contrast of flavor with fruit, cheese, and vegetable was a harbinger of good things to come.

My first dish was a grape salad.  It had both red and green grape halves with candied walnuts, enoki mushrooms, and some feta cheese with a light dressing.  What an interesting salad with wonderful flavors!

Next came the star of the evening and according to Noemi, the most ordered thing on the Yonaka menu--the sake orenji--Scottish salmon with orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon and orange oil, maldon, and micro arugula.  Salmon nicely laced with fat cut sashimi style on a bed of orange slices.  The tobiko added so much flavor to the dish.  Beautiful blend of flavors with the orange and the salmon.  The sauce was their homemade ponzu and it was superb!

At this point, Nodemi asked if I could eat two more dishes or was I too full and should we go directly to dessert.  Rhetorical for me but she was serious. I told her that of course I'd go for two more dishes and she said that it would be one more cold dish and one hot dish.  Next came tate ichigo--sliced Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, negi, apricot and strawberry relish, hibiscus salt, Thai chili, negi oil, and strawberry sauce.  (I stole the full description from my friend Amelinda so I'll give her credit!) The raw scallops with the strawberry slices was another example of a different take on fish.  It's no wonder they refer to this as modern Japanese food.  It was delicious!

Before the hot course, I was brought a lollipop--a frozen cube of cantaloupe as a palette cleanser.  Very nice touch and very good.

Then the hot dish came.  It was skirt steak pieces with mushrooms, tomatoes, Brussels sprout leaves and some cracked salt.  The meat was a little on the rare side which was good and there were both tomato wedges and halved grape tomatoes.  The cracked salt added so much flavor to the dish.  Now I was feeling full, but there was one more dish to come--dessert.

Dessert was the mango cotta, a large round of mango panna cotta filled with mango "egg" made from mango pure.  On the other side of some mango tuile was some mango ice cream on a bed of pistachio butter.  Both sides of the dessert had finely chopped pistachio pieces and it was a tremendous ending to a wonderful meal!

Service was excellent throughout my time there.  The restaurant only had one other table occupied so it was quiet.  The music was perfect--modern and not too loud.

Now all I have to do is get some Yelp volunteers to join me so we can give the full omakase a true workout.  It was quite good of them to allow me to do a lesser version of the omakase with full size dishes of fewer courses.  Very well done and deserving of all 5 stars!

From the last Yelp-Elite party in San Francisco, I was chatting with one of my favorite Yelpers and she gave me few places to go in Las Vegas. One of the places she suggested was Serendipity 3, which is located at Caesars Palace. The New York restaurant is one of my personal bookmarked businesses. Until she mentioned it, I didn't know there was also one in Las Vegas. 

So after I dropped off my luggage at my stay at the Platinum Hotel, which is only a "long" block away from Caesars Palace and the lively Las Vegas strip, I was excited and hurried my ass to Serendipity at Caesars Palace. 

The restaurant is cute and crowded, but the bar was empty and had the crazy football game between the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals showing on their huge television. Looking at the huge menu, the restaurant serves your typical American food. But my main target was definitely-the Frozen Hot Chocolate with chopped peanut butter cups and clouds of whipped cream for $10.00. Since I was at the bar, the popular frozen treat was prepared at the bar and came really fast and presented in front of my face. I was shocked on how my treat was made with the pretty design and the liquid flooded all over my dish. One sip of my first Frozen Hot Chocolate, I was blown-away on how sinful this treat was. I was enjoying my frosty treat while watching the football game and watching the agile waitresses and gifted chefs working hard in the kitchen. 

My treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?userid=HYQoxBC1y1DGPq6pGP09Tw

The treat may contain 10,000 calories, but you'll need it after burning off all those calories walking on the overpass to get across the street and into the next casino

Remember, get the popular frozen treat at the bar. You'll get it quicker. 

My Visa was accepted here and picked the right time of the day to enjoy my treat. Serendipity is the "Real Deal!"

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

I went to Two Hippies Breakfast Joint open-minded the other day... I was in the area and jonesing for some healthy but filling breakfast food.  Conveniently located just off 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback, I pulled in when I saw the place and joined just a handful of other peeps inside.

First of all, the ambiance of this place is right on with their name... very hippy like.  Adorning the walls are all kinds of posters including the likes of Grateful Dead, Animal House, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Led Zeppelin, and even one of Bob Marley smoking a big fat jizzoint.  There are also license plates from all over the country, an old school pinball machine, and some bicycles.

The staff was super friendly - it's the type of place where you order at the counter and they call your name when your food is ready.  I looked at the menu and debated between doing a breakfast bowl and a bowl of oatmeal with a side of scrambled egg whites.  My decision was made when I was told that indeed the oatmeal is not the instant kind.  And they even served it with soy milk and blueberries per my request.  My dining companion went with a breakfast bowl burrito style and was happy with his order too...

The only negative (which I now see is in some of the previous reviews) is that it was disappointing to eat in and have our meals served on styrofoam... not only is it not so enjoyable to eat on styrofoam, but it's very un-hippylike!  

It's worth noting that this place has more than just breakfast - they also have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and salads... and they have free soup daily!

This place was better than the reviews reflect, especially for the price.  I would definitely return but since it's a bit out of my 3 mile radius, it may not be for awhile.  That should give them enough time to switch out the styrofoam!

I try to have will power and 90% of the time I do pretty good...at least when it comes to savory foods. However when I'm faced with a delicious sweet treat, it's like Pandora's box had been opened and I'm done for. Now I have never been lucky enough to travel to Belgium but after tasting authentic chocolate from there, I am putting a visit at the top of my list. I am so excited to get the first to review for this business and hope I am far from the last. This new Belgium chocolate shop just opened up a couple weeks ago and today I paid them a visit and got to calm my sweet tooth cravings. The Belgium owner was incredibly knowledgable and said they import their chocolate directly from a Belgium man he's known 
forever. He then asked me about my taste bud preferences. While I like all chocolate, I'm typically more drawn to milk chocolate and if you add anything caramel, marshmallow or peanut butter then I'm really sold. He directed me to the milk chocolate with caramel inside. One bite and I was in chocolate heaven. The caramel was sweetly delicious and I knew I must have more. I ended up buying two more of the chocolate caramel and two chocolate cream which I was told is like a combination of whip cream and brandy. I'm sold. I will be visiting often and can't wait to try their hot chocolate and coffee. They also had some amazing looking croissants and adorable chocolate gnomes, pumpkins for Thanksgiving and will be getting Yule logs soon. I immediately envisioned serving ice cream sundaes inside the hollow chocolate fixtures. 

My advice to you is to pay this new chocolatier a visit and nip your chocolate cravings. If you're wondering where they are located, I will tell you! They are right along the ArtWall, across the street from Tea Time.

Hey @KFC, I'm convinced that this is the worst KFC in Vegas, if not the world. Look at how many one star reviews this location has! I should have checked with Yelp to spare myself from the horrendous meal I just experienced.

For the record, I don't cheat on my diet often but when I do, I expect it to be both good and worth it. Not too much to ask for I don't think. After trying to go to another restaurant only to find out they were closed due to a family emergency, I wound up here. And now I'm so grossed out so much that I think I'm never coming back.

Don't go to this franchise! Whoever owns this place must be cheap and prefers to scam people instead of doing the right thing. Rather than saying they're out of gravy, they instead presented me with gravy that was the consistency of water and tried to pass that off as the real thing.

May I present you with Exhibit A? https://vine.co/v/MxbPj22t6Pl

Your honor, I rest my case.

As a last resort, I tried it hoping that at least the flavor was still there but unfortunately my gut instinct was correct. Indeed it was watered down gravy along with watered down flavor. Or maybe a disgruntled employee took a whizz in it. Who knows?! All I know is that it was disgusting! My wondering about what I had just ingested ruined my whole meal & appetite for a long time. As a result, I didn't finish eating and threw everything away. A complete waste of money as well as calories!

The manager, Jesus, was unhelpful and didn't seem to care. Overall an awful fast food experience that probably has ruined me for KFC for life. It was so bad that it inspired my very first negative fast food review. Congrats guys... this 1's for you!

The Biltmore is superbly impressive from the moment you drive up and keeps your eyes dancing throughout your stay.  So much history and so much charm, this place is part Playboy Mansion, part Neverland Ranch and part Palace of Versailles.  Life size chess sets on the perfectly manicured lawn, fountains at every turn, an undeveloped mountain range as its backdrop, and poolside cabanas fit for Marilyn Monroe (she called the Biltmore her favorite pool).  Indeed, the halls are lined with photographic history of famous guests spanning the resort's opening in 1929 to present day.  (I didn't take a star off for the picture of our current prez who's a repeat guest, but I was tempted).  It makes you feel like royalty to just be there, even if you're an average Joe like me.

I give an enthusiastic A+ to the SERVICE, landscaping, feather-topped bed, and aesthetic appeal/charm of the grounds.  I was most impressed with the service.  With rooms running $600 a night, you don't want to find out that only half of the staff got the five star customer service training.  Biltmore has it down from the front desk to groundskeepers.  A special mention of the 24/7 town cars waiting to pick you up any time you're ready  to step out.

I give an A to the spa which could use a face lift, but nonetheless awarded me the best massage and facial that I've had this millennium.  Also to the in-room dining which was kinda yummy, but lickety-split, the fastest room service I ever had.

I give an A- to the room decor.  They are going for that Mission-style rustic chic, but it looked a little too Hilton and could use less of the "standardized theme" decor.  But, the rooms were very well kept and sparkling clean.  I stayed in, and highly recommend, a "resort deluxe" room and think it's worth every extra penny to wake up to coffee on your private balcony with a view of the mountains.  

If I hadn't stayed there in the middle of winter I could have played at one of their eight pools. (I'd def hang at the one with the waterslide AND the swim up bar.)  On the flip side, it was nice to have the resort virtually to myself; I had no problem getting room service in less than 1/2 an hour or a couple same-day reservations at the spa.

*psst* It's Frank Lloyd Wright "inspired."  The actual architect was a student of his, but the big guy didn't actual design the hotel.  Darn good knock-off though!

This was one of the best food evenings I have ever spent.  I made my reservation through their process about a month ago.  While I originally requested the 5:30 seating, there was a singleton space for the 8:30 so I went for it.

I showed up about 8:05 and handed my gold ticket to them.  I was then escorted to the bar where I had some ice water and started to meet my dining mates for the evening - Greg and Lindsey from Glasgow, Scotland.

At about 8:40, we were escorted into the separate dining area that has a horseshoe shaped table with 8 seats.  Behind the table was the staff ready to greet us, tell us a few rules, and encourage us to ask questions about anything.  Then the dinner started.

Over the next three hours, the staff made some of the most creative, tasty, and beautifully plated dishes I have experienced.  Since the room seats 8 people only, generally four servers each took 2 plates so all 8 of us were served in unison.  I had the non-alcohol drink paring which gave me a chance to have spirit-like drinks along with the other diners.  And in two instances, my food or drink was not laced with alcohol but with lemonade or some other substitute.

Each of the 20+ courses was explained.  We often had questions about technique, ingredients, or other matters.  One of the chefs came out of the kitchen to explain the red mushroom we enjoyed and explained why it was red and whence it came.

The staff is amazing.  They are friendly, always smiling, and always enjoying what they do.  I really felt that I was a valued visitor.

The room - oh it's quite different.  Two walls are lined with card catalog boxes to represent the knowledge Andrs has built up in his mind over the years.  There's a bustier which know one explained on the wall and a ladder with high heels on the rungs.  Very creative and innovative!

Midnight was almost upon us as we finished the dessert courses.  We then signed the guest book - I was diner #1693.  I then passed the book to Lindsey to sign and so we went around the table.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to try something very different and wants to find out about molecular gastronomy.  It was truly a very delicious and memorable evening.  All the staff at  made it outstanding with food and service!

Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pice de rsistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).

So what do you call a place that serves decent Mexican food, outstanding chicken dishes with some Asian influence?  Well, they call it Chino Bandido's!

Now I'll admit, I get a charge and some amusement by watching Guy Fieri of Food Network visit these local DDD.  We have also visited quite a few of Guy's places over the years.  The yummy Guatemalan place in Santa Fe, NM is probably the best, while there's been quite a few near misses, too.  But Chino Bandido's.... well we somehow missed that episode.

So when I saw that sign, with Guy's gargantuan smiling face (see photo) I thought okay, what am I in for this evening?  Well not to worry. As it turned out it, it was all for the best, as the Four Star review might indicate. 

According to Food Network: "Chino Bandido's Chinese-Mexican-Jamaican dishes have garnered lifelong fans. Guy loved the fusion, calling it one of the most original on DDD. The best part? The menu has more than 90,000 combinations. For a spicy option try the Pollo Diablo, Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Pow!"  Ugh, I could have done without that pow. LOL

The first thing that's tricks you as you enter, is the industrial, high ceilings and plastic 10 foot folding tables and chairs right out of Sam's Club, or Costco. The other thing you notice is the re, Chinese "Great Wall" muriel with a panda dressed as a Via Zapata style bandido. Some things don't translate I guess. LOL

I do not believe Chino Bandido's is Chinese at all. Well, not in the traditional sense. Heck, not in any sense really.  Yes, I see a Fried Rice, Egg Foo Yung, Chinese BBQ Pork, and Teriyaki Chicken on the menu.  But no Asian soups.  No General Tso's, no Orange Beef or Chicken, no Kung Pow, no buckwheat noodles, I could go on.

What I see is a very strong Jamaican influence.  That Panda could easily be a photo-shopped for Bob Marley because of all the Jerky Chicken and Jerky Rice. Sorry guys, or should I say Guy. LOL

But there were some hiccups along the way, but I really love this place. And two hundred or of my co-workers who seem to come each day cannot be all wrong. LOL

For me, just order the Jerky Chicken (photo) and you'll see what I mean. Delicious. Expect to pay $8 or so. 

Enjoy!

After a nice dinner and a great time in DTLV with Terri R, our last stop for the evening was dessert. In fact, we purposely put dessert aside because of all the hype that Kuma has been receiving the last couple of nights.  It seemed like every Vegas Yelper, at least the ones we knew, were checking in.  We were no different and had to see what's really going on.

Well, what's really going on?  For me, not much anyway.  My first impression of the place was cool.  I mean, this place is cold.  Kuma goes out of the way to make you feel like you're in an igloo with the their snow decor, polar bear, and even ice looking flooring.  My first thought, this place would be perfect to go to during the summer to just chill.  I mean that literally.  

As for their "snow cream", I wasn't too impressed. First of all, not fluffy like advertised.  That's no big because it's all about taste and satisfaction for me.  I opted for their Taro w/Red Bean, Mochi, and Capt N Crunch.  I thought taste was pretty good, but texture wasn't what I expected.  Again, I expected a fluffy snow type feel. What I got was texture close to froyo.  Taste wise, I'd give them 4 stars. 

But why the overall 3 stars?  Here's why;
1.  Selection:  Not much of a choice of flavors here.  I'm not saying there should be a plethora of flavors, but 5 just doesn't cut it for me.  

2.  Price:  You have choice of two sizes.  Their smaller size is their "Ninja" and their biggest size is their "Sumo".  Both are pricey, with the Ninja costing $5.  The cup size is huge, but this is where the disappointment starts.  Look at the pictures all over this joint and even the pictures that Kuma has posted.  You see their snow cream over-flowing at least 2 inches above the rim.  Now look at the pictures that Yelpers have posted, even mine.  You see skimpy portions and this is where they get you.  But I get it. Their $5 small is named Ninja for a reason.  Silent, but deadly....on your wallet that is. 

I'm giving this place 3 stars for now because Kuma is just A-Okay in my book.  I'm not saying I will never return.  I'm sure my daughter and nephews would love this place, especially since I'm Daddy Warbucks to them.  I just don't see myself going out of my way for Kuma.

Stayed here for a friends recent 30th birthday celebrations and I was surprised at how nice it was. Though I'm a fan of the Cosmo and Monte Carlo, I would definitely consider this place again.

ROOMS: The rooms were updated. We had a suite that had a living area, a jacuzzi tub inside, and a nice updated bathroom. Because we were so high up, we got to look down over the casino. I'm afraid of heights so it was a little terrifying, especially since there isn't really anything but a small wall to keep you from climbing over. I wonder how many drunk people accidentally plummet to their demise?

Because the hotel is in the shape of a pyramid, the elevators move in a diagonal. The rooms are set up that way, too. Because of this odd shape, there are weird pockets of empty space where furniture doesn't fit which I'm guessing was a interior decorating nightmare for the poor designers. Overall, the room was nice and clean and since it was non-smoking, smelled fresh the duration of the trip.

POOL: This was nice and it's located near the parking structure. They provide towels and a lot of adult beverages at the pool. They aren't the cheapest ($30 for a bucket of 6 beers) and we went with the Shocktops which actually came in can form. I'm guessing it's because you can't have glass by the pool, but if you're a Bud drinker, the cans are aluminum so you're okay.

The water is shallow and they have some pedestals in the middle where you can lounge or do as we did and rest your drinks on it. They have the VIP cabanas and pool for those people that think they are high rollers and plenty of lifeguards on deck in case you drown.

PARKING: Super easy in an adjacent structure. You don't have to maneuver much through the casino to find the check-in area. They even have a motorcycle parking area if you're on two wheels. 

INTERNET: We could never connect, so if you're in need to do work, I would maybe try to find another spot in the hotel.

If you can get a cheap rate, it's worth it. Especially if you're just going to be out on the town anyways.

Hidden Gem
Hole in the wall
Small crappy looking shack that serves delicious grub

All three of these phrases perfectly describe Viva Las Arepas, but I like the third one the best!

Located at the end of the strip, on Las Vegas Blvd, just a few blocks past the Stratosphere Hotel, sits a small, ugly white shack in a deserted parking lot that serves up some of the tastiest little snacks in all of Las Vegas. 

Viva Las Arepas serves up some of the best tasting Arepas I've ever eaten. For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;

Lengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hA
Ground Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ug
Black Bean & Cheese Empanada http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQ

All three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good. 

To wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q 

The prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly. 

If you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas. Trust ME.

Finally got a chance to visit the Pasty.  First, it is in a hard to find location if you aren't familiar with the hidden restaurants inside commercial center off of Sahara. Situated right next to Komol, the restaurant does indeed have the feel of a pub with the center of attention the beautiful bar.  I came here for lunch and there were about 3 tables full and 3 people at the bar and one waitperson to handle all of us.  As a result, it appeared she was the proverbial chicken with her head cut off, often scurrying past me several times before taking my order, bringing my check, etc.  I have to hand it to her though, she managed to keep my tea filled and was friendly! She had excellent knowledge of the menu and the popular items.

Word of caution: if you only have an hour lunch and it takes 15 minutes each way, don't come here unless you order ahead, this place is not quick, and that is probably because the pastry shell needs time to cook.  I watched them prep my meat and cheese pasty and it takes time.  The pasty is filled with large chunks of what reminded me of square meatballs and a cheddary cheese.  I have to say, I was expecting to be disappointed and not have much filling inside like so many calzones and empanadas I have tried.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised as my pasty came filled to the brim and I killed 3 days of dieting in one meal.  The red wine gravy was excellent!

All in all, the unique offerings here coupled with the extensive pub brew list (including strongbow cider) puts this restaurant on my regular rotation.

Sure there are some bugs to work out with the service (A customer at the bar said yesterday they had 6 waitpeople) and if you don't want pasty, your choices are limited to salads and appetizers, but Cornish Pasty Co. is a welcome addition to the area.

My first breakfast at Tryst, and I cannot wait to go back!  (Especially since Tryst offers organic and local produce-- just say no to GMOs!)

Arrived at 1pm and had only 45 minutes to spare-- good thing I already checked out the menu online and decided what I wanted to try: the Monte Cristo w/ a side of sweet potato tots, and a cup of organic coffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=tYVvx24tyHyryZWgtiTVOg.  Was seated in Joanna's section- friendly server!  The Monte Cristo- two slices of French toast with ham, melty gruyere cheese, and strawberry jam, sliced into two halves, arrived nine minutes after I ordered it-- fantastic!!  The dish looked beautiful, and the plate hadn't even touched my table for two seconds when I overheard Joanna describe to someone at another table what I had ordered.  It was that striking!

Looked so tantalizing, and I loved the sweet and salty combination.  I just wished it was heartier... I worked very hard to eat only one-half of the dish.  Same thing with the sweet potato tots (loved the crunch factor of these!)... It didn't take me long to work my way through half of the dish, and I still wanted more!  The Black and Tan organic coffee (black, no cream) was just OK.  I might try a cappucino next time, if only to check out the coffee art.  ;)

I think I'm going to check out the Pineapple upside-down pancakes tomorrow!

Note: Tryst offers "Tryst Around the World," and March is "Ireland" (I think last month was France).  Anyhoo, there's Potato leek soup (this sounds interesting!), and the salmon dish caught my eye. Tryst offers $10 off if you make a dinner reservation- something worth noting.

Wow. 5 stars for a grocery store, huh? I've only been to a handful of these elsewhere and haven't found much that appeals to my grocery perusing self. Honestly, I've always thought of Whole Foods as a "window shopping" grocery store. Not the smartest way to utilize one's time, let me tell ya. Despite the astronomically priced goods and somewhat niche, organic, so-local-it-will-make-your-eyes-water type products, these guys earn a solid 5-star high five. Here's why. 

Staff. There is more staff in this joint than you could imagine. I counted 11 behind the cheese counter, 6 behind the fish counter, 6 at the coffee shop, and at least 2 people on each check-out lane. Every aisle had a representative to answer questions, talk up products, or help you find what you need throughout this organic wonderland. 

Local. I love seeing produce and from farms and farmers that are just hours away. There were vendors delivering local salmon, produce, meat, beer, and coffee while people were walking around. It seems that these guys aren't playing around with the idea of "best products for where YOU are" mantra. This does Charlotte well. 

Levels. This place has three levels. First floor is everyone's favorite grocery store. Second is a cafe and third is a cooking school. Yes. A freaking cooking school. That is so rad. They are definitely aiming to be more than just a store where you can buy stuff. The bottom floor is the parking deck. Get this. There are freaking escalators you can ride WITH your shopping cart. Hello, future. This place is just ridiculously cool. 

Although it is a grocery store, I think WF can do some really cool things in Charlotte. I'm looking forward to seeing how the beer/wine bar on the 1st floor impacts the local breweries! So cool to see NoDa, Foothills, Birdsong and Olde Meck on draught! Yes. Draught, local brewskies at a freaking grocery store. Dig it. 

Looking forward to all that is to come for these guys!

I'm really glad that this place opened up since it's so close to where I work. I now have another place I can stop in for a drink on my way home.

I popped in today for their soft opening for a hangover lunch. Their menu is pretty much the same as the other two Vigs so you can count on decent but not remarkable food. I've always gone to The Vig for the atmosphere over the food anyway so my expectations were met.

Today I have The Trifecta which is three sliders with fries. I washed this down with a Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale-totally hit the spot but I'm not and never will be a fan of pretzel buns. Although this is an appetizer it is very filling.

They've done a great job with the space. The bar and dining area are smaller than the other two locations but there is a second, atrium-like dinning room. The Patio is the true jewel of this location with a really nice outdoor bar and ample seating. It's going to be GREAT when winter comes.

What I was most impressed with was the service. Even though they've not officially opened everyone seems to have it together. One reason I don't go to The Vig Uptown is the attitude of some of the servers. Most of the servers here were very friendly and enthusiastic. My bartender Ashley was friendly  and, knowing that I was hurting, made sure that my water glass was full.

So I don't know that I'll come in when I'm hungry but I look forward to coming in when I'm thirsty. Like I said, I can't wait to hang on the patio when it cools off.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, "the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices."   

This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.

MENU:
Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:
Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50

SERVICE:
As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.

FOOD:
Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.

We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  

On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.

As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  

PRICES:
Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.

"That smoothie was so good I almost stole it from Cathy" - a very daring statement from my sister. Take my money, take my boyfriend...I'll get over it. Take my food? You want war!

After a nice morning at the gym, my sister and I finally went here after months of talking about it. I keep hearing positive comments about this place. They have vegan, gluten-free and regular options. But fear not, they have bacon if that's your thing.

Coconut Almond Blended:
I absolutely have a strong dislike of anything coconut. But with my lucky experiences of getting something I hate and ending up liking it (for the past few months) inspired me to get this. Well, I can add this to the list. It tasted like a very mild horchata. Pleasantly and surprisingly delicious! 5/5

Kale Apple Banana Smoothie:
The taste of kale reminds me of a fruit I ate when I was little, Spanish plum. So drinking kale + other fruits isn't foreign to me. This was a little sweetness to it and a nice tart flavor. 5/5

Iced Coffee:
I'm not a big coffee drinker but THIS was good. It takes them 8 hours to make. It wasn't bitter and I didn't feel the need to add anything to it. 5/5

The Hummus:
Comes with warm pita and olives on top. I ate around the olives since I'm allergic to them. Freshly made and delightful. 4/5

The Agrodolce Brussels Sprouts:
Roasted Brussels sprouts with Italian sweet and sour vinaigrette. The sprouts looked a bit overcooked but when you eat them, they still have that crunch. The vinaigrette was a bit tangy and refreshing. 5/5

The Curried Quinoa:
Quinoa, dried cranberries, almonds, parsley with sweet curry. Lots of textures and flavors. Quinoa and almonds are good non-meat protein sources minus LDL's. Cranberries are good for the ladies. 5/5

The Bizness:
Chopped kale with lemon vinaigrette. You can pick and choose 3 side items or roasted chicken / bacon / avocado to put in this salad. So, if you get a combo that sucks then, it's your fault! Accountability 101. But no worries, all the sides they have are good. 5/5

The Banana Boy Bait:
This got me singing "hey you're such a pretty boy. Hey you're such a pretty boy. You're so pretty". Banana bread with natural sweeteners. The top has a little crunch to it. They bring it to you hot. Yuuuuuummm!!! I was supposed to split this 50/50 with my sister but quickly ended up at  60/40 - she caught me before it went to 80/20. "I'm saving you from calories." 5/5

This is located inside The Center which is a LGBTQ facility. They have books and computers with internet. They have their own parking lot which is a big deal because I'm not a fan of paying for parking! I love this place!!!

I visited last night at around 6:45.  Because I was meeting my dining companion here at 7, I decided to sit at the bar and take advantage of happy hour.  I was impressed by the long list of $2 beers, which included Woodchuck Amber hard cider, which I ordered.  Happy hour here seems quite popular--the bar was almost full at the time that I arrived, and was completely full by the time my dining companion arrived--and given the selection and discount, I can certainly understand the attraction!

Once my dining companion arrived, we got a table.  Having heard good things about the fried cauliflower patties, we decided to get an order of them to share.  (This worked out nicely, since one order comprises 4 patties.)  They were quite nice, esp. with the lemon aioli sauce drizzled on them, tasting similar to potato patties.  Cauliflower patties aren't an item that would normally hold a huge appeal to me, but I'd definitely recommend them!

For my entree, I ordered the turkey burger, since I'd also heard good things about it, and my dining companion ordered the Social (beef) burger.  Based on other reviews, I was expecting a mind-blowingly delicious turkey burger.  Alas, this was not the case.  Paradoxically, the turkey patty and bun were extremely dry, whereas the toppings were overly moist.  As I ate the burger, the far end became soggier and soggier, to the point that I found it inedible, only finishing 2/3 of it.  The burger wasn't nearly as flavorful as I was hoping, either--I could barely taste the gouda cheese, and the lettuce and tomatoes didn't add much to it in terms of flavor, either.  In general, the ingredients struck me as low quality.

I ordered the cheesy tomato soup as a side, and it wasn't bad--it was thicker and creamier than Campbell's, though it wasn't quite as cheesy as I would have hoped, and I'm not sure how I feel about the toasted bready thing floating in it.  The burgers came with fresh cut fries, which was a nice touch, but they were nothing too special.

Aside from the food, service was pretty lackluster, with our waitress making minimal conversation, etc.--although she did keep our water glasses filled, which we appreciated.  As for the ambiance, I'd describe it as rather loud and somewhat boisterous--which I suppose is to be expected for a place called Social.  People were engaging in some fun activities, such as ping pong and darts, which was cool to watch.

Overall, with the exception of the cauliflower patties, I wasn't very impressed with the food at Social.  (I found out later that Social is owned by the same group that owns Shady Grove, for which I have similar feelings.)  If you want a solid turkey burger, I'd recommend checking out BRGR nearby. I'd consider returning for happy hour, but would definitely go elsewhere for dinner.

La Pizza, or also known as JJ's Pizza Window, is located inside the Paris Hotel & Casino. It is connected to JJ's Boulangerie. I was waiting for hubby to get finished at a store and decided to try a slice of pizza from here. You order from the walk-up window and they sell pizza by the slice. The cashier was very friendly and told me that fresh pizza was just coming out of the oven. She also said they use san marzano tomatoes in their pizza sauce. I just ordered a simple slice of "Cheese Pizza" priced at $4 before tax. It was a decent size slice. Next to the walk-up window there is a small seating area with about 4 tables that have 2 chairs at each table. The pizza slice was pretty good. I did have to dab some grease off of the top with a napkin, but that was just my preference, it wasn't too overly greasy. The crust was crisp and the pizza was nice and hot. I think next time I will get a slice with toppings and see how that is. I also will ask for a side of sauce since I didn't taste too much of it on the pizza and I usually enjoy dipping my pizza in sauce anyway. I know in the picture I posted it looks like there was a decent amount of sauce, but I really couldn't taste it. The pizza slice is 3.5 stars for me. I give a full 4 stars total because the pizza was edible and didn't taste bad (it just didn't *wow* me), the cashier was friendly and I enjoyed sitting at one of their outside tables by myself having a quick slice and tourist-watching. 

The daily special (probably everyday) is 1 slice of pizza, chips and a drink for $6.99, but I had a drink already so just the slice would do for me today. If you are passing through this is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.

Holy crap. Since staying here... I really feel like I cannot stay anywhere else. I stayed at their standard room and OMG. It was HEAVEN. If I were a celebrity living in a hotel - THIS would be my choice hotel. 

It may be off the strip... but SO worth it.

WIN: No smoking, no casino, all classy

This is for the NON gamblers and really the people who want to relax. I'm not much of a party person or gambler. This was perfect for my "just get away from it all" weekends. 

STANDARD ROOM: -
Resort fee - $25 - includes wifi, pool, gym etc. 

Like a TINY NY Studio Apartment
Mini kitchen - fridge, microwave, counters, stove
Mini living room - couch, chairs, table
Bed - lots of pillows and plushness - LOVE, TV
Lots of closet space

BATHROOM:
There's a TV in the bathroom! Eek! I love it! 
Jet stream tub
separate glass (be careful) doorway to the toilet and also a shower

CONDIMENTS: 
The shampoo and conditioner stuff was nice. Very good selection - as an Asian - I look at that sh*t. :) Very good quality stuff too.
Free bottled water

BREAKFAST:
We ordered room service - they came in and they set the whole thing up for you in the living room space. They place a table cloth over the table and provide everything for you. 
And the room service was delicious!

PARKING:
Valet parking
My fiance has a sports car that he loves and the valet guy and him were so nice about it that he let my fiance part the car in front of the hotel and he said he'd watch it for us the whole time. Nice guy. Really awesome parking experience. 

SERVICE:
Easy and just awesome. We got in and out and done. Nice chat with the front desk and seriously, just a perfect experience.

OVERALL: 
I love this hotel. Trump... good job.

My second favorite buffet is vegas!!! (#1 is Studio B)

I took Kimberly K's awesome advice to take advantage of lunch prices for dinner.  So basically this was my first stop driving into vegas on a Tuesday and we arrived about 30 minutes before lunch was about to end.
Got in for lunch price at $20 and got to eat dinner as well, which is normally $30.  Paying for 5 people, it was a $50 savings!

PRICES: as of 9/6/11  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=O5p34DZJZrd9YRIoHpREMQ

Breakfast : M-F 6am to 11am = $16
Lunch: M-F  11am-4pm = $20
Dinner Sun-Th  4pm-10pm = $30
Gourmet Dinner Fri/Sat  4pm-10pm $37
Weekend Brunch 7am-4pm  $25    (with champagne = $30)

The most important part for me is that they have a pretty good dessert selection : These were my pickings :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=aBragtXmC5EWj12o632S-A

They had: CREME BRULEE, soft serve, banana foster, bread pudding, cute little cone things, carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, tarts, flan. Ofcourse these were not superb desserts like u would find at jean philippes. But for buffet desserts, i think this is way better than most. Way better than Wynn buffet, which i thought was bad overall. Didn't see any chocolate covered strawberries tho. :( 

Meats and Seafood:
Kobe Top Round, Prime Rib, Ham, Roast Chicken, Turkey. 
(my fave was the top round)
Snow Crab Legs, King Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail. 
*crab was a bit salty and not super fresh. but it really didnt' stop anyone for getting heaping piles of it. 

Other stuff they had was Salmon Teriyaki, Miso Chilean Seabass, 3 kinds of mashpotatoes including sweet potato- my fave was the pesto mash potatoes. A few different salads, which werent' that great. pasta salads, soups, chashu bao, salmon and tuna sushi and poke, CA rolls, sliders (meh), pizza, mac and cheese, sausage

I've been to this buffet probably about 5 times over the years, and it's been pretty consistently good IMO. Unfortunately prices keep going up and lines can get ridiculously long. If it were the weekend, i would prefer going to SB, but if i'm here during the weekday, i would definitely recommend coming here for a late lunch/early dinner!!!

I am writing this review as I enjoy leftovers from dinner earlier tonight. 

The Nora experience ...ahh where to start...
From the moment you step into Nora's you feel right at home. 
The restaurant has this indescribable homey feel to it that just puts a person at ease. There are two rooms to the restaurant, without having made a reservation, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately in the room by the kitchen.
Their ceiling is very unique and is decorated with Trinacria ornaments which is the symbol of Sicily. Our server was nice enough to give us a short history lesson...pretty interesting. 

The garlic bread...ahhh the garlic bread...I could probably eat three baskets myself. So thin, crispy, and buttery....ahh AND GARLICKY...so delicious. The first basket is free and every additional basket is 2.50...which is smart of them because it is just that addicting. I can see people going off on the garlic bread and call it a day. 

I ordered the Chicken Carciofi in attempts to be "healthy"....I figured that chicken breast can't be that bad for you...eh. 
The order is served with pasta, fresh tomatoes, artichokes, and capers. The chicken was so moist and the flavors were just MMmmmMm...perfect...not to salty and just right. Pretty much blown away at first bite. Very generous portions, which explains why I'm stuffing my face with pasta at 1:30am...
Such a bad idea blaghhh...Body will hate me for eating all these carbs before bed.

Friends got the rigatoni special and cheese raviolis which were great as well but I was pretty overwhelmed with my Carciofi to really enjoy theirs.

We also got the calamari and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, but I wasn't really impressed with either.

Really great Italian food at very reasonable prices without sacrificing service. Our server was very attentive and informative. I will definitely be back to try the crazy alfredo. It is probably a good idea to make a reservation next time to be seated in the main room.

Guaranteed to put you in a food coma.

***The Signature at MGM Grand is a good option if you are looking for an un-Vegas like hotel on The Strip***

The Strip is filled with mostly resort and casino combinations that are themed and/or upscale.  Recently though, new properties have been emerging to offer an un-Vegas like experience.  No casino hotels.  No smoking hotels.  I have not stayed at many of these hotels (The Mandarin, Vdara), but my most recent Vegas stay was at The Signature at MGM Grand (which is business friendly and not like the mega casinos on The Strip).  The Signature is filled with spacious condos that are complete with kitchenettes, whirlpool bathtubs and (in some rooms) balconies.

The Signature is located in the back of the MGM Grand.  It is attached to the MGM Grand via many airport-like automated walkways.  The hotel has very limited services.  There is a small lounge as well as an order-at-the-counter cafe.  For more dining options or expensive convenience store items, you are going to need to make the long trip to the MGM Grand.  This hotel does have its own pool as well as a 24-hour fitness center though it was difficult getting an open machine in the morning.

The rooms at The Signature are nice.  The decor is up-to-date enough and the rooms are comfortable and very spacious.  Rooms come with kitchenettes, a big living area and a table (this creates a great pre-going out spot).  Rooms are also equipped with safes.  Room temperature was nice.

There were a few minor negatives in the room.  It was difficult turning the TV off (it kept turning itself back on).  There were some missing items like no hotel directory to provide information on location of business center, fitness center and such.  No laundry bag either.

Bathrooms are very big here.  Each room comes with a huge whirlpool tub as well as a big glass shower.  Unfortunately, the shower head had a very concentrated blast and not the widespread rain-like shower head many hotels are now featuring.  Getting the perfect water temperature in the shower was not easy either.

Service was fine.

Room rates at The Signature are typically higher than the MGM Grand, but they are not too expensive when compared to other similar properties along The Strip and it is less expensive than several of the upscale resorts on The Strip.

I think how much you like The Signature is going to depend on what you are looking for in a Las Vegas hotel.  If you are looking for a good value room that is big and great for gatherings (as well as not next to a smoky casino), The Signature is a really good option.  If you want a more themed hotel as well as something that is convenient and a quick walk to the many other Las Vegas casinos, The Signature is probably not where you want to stay.

I personally like having some of the niceties of The Signature like the big rooms and the non-smoking property, but given how far it is from The Strip, I would much rather stay at the Renaissance for a more business-like and less Vegas-like hotel experience, where I am getting the lower room rate as well as earning Marriott Rewards points.

Complimentary valet parking is offered.  If you want complimentary self parking, you will need to park at the MGM Grand's parking structure, which is a very long walk to The Signature.

"I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found? 
What's this?" - J. Skellington


The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.

Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.

Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.

Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...

Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.

Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!

And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay

Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!

One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !

And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day

I'm writing this review in the midst of the happy food coma this restaurant put me in. I was so excited when I found out that Short Leash was going to be unleashed to become their own stand along restaurant! This means that I don't have to chase a truck to get my Short Leash fix anymore! We rushed here the first available moment and tonight was the night. Knowing that Short Leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eat here too, we came early at about 5:30. I'm so glad we did because by the time we left at 6:45pm, there was a wait almost out the door! 

The hot dogs are exactly what you would expect: delicious Schreiner's sausages sandwiched between fresh Naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top. There are several unique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog. We started with the corn dog bites which come on skewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spicy sauce. The corn dogs are amazing; freshly made corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage. For my entree, I decided to go with a class Short Leash special, the Sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit, goat cheese, prosciutto and arugula. It's one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients. Besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today, this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders. They also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog! 

As for the environment, it's very neighborhood friendly. Everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables. Be prepared to dine with a couple strangers (who might become new-found friends!) if you come during peak hours. If you don't feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table, then I suggest that you eat at the bar. It's simple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it. Brad and Kat's friendly personality comes to life as Brad welcomes you inside while Kat cooks up a storm in the back. 

I am so happy that this successful food truck has turned into an adorable restaurant. Their food, service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant! I will happily return again soon to get my Short Leash fix. 

***** 
After dining on our hot dogs, we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food truck success story, Mamma Toledo who opened up The Pie Hole next door. Look for that review coming up next!

The owner greeted me at my car door with a giant umbrella to escort me inside the restaurant while it was raining...

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! 

Georgie S. wasn't kidding when she said this place is a fantastic establishment. Its totally in a shitty strip mall and from the outside looks like an old greasy diner, but let me tell you friends, looks can certainly be deceiving, and in this instance, they totally 100% completely are. 

I visited last Sunday on the rainiest day in the universe. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a bowl of Jelly Bellys, and if you know anything about me, you know I love me some jelly beans. Spoon full for me, Handful for you. We asked for a booth, so they quickly got one ready and seated us, all the while shooting the shit and laughing with us about something or other. 

They have this whole New York theme going which made me happy reminiscing on my days living in the city. Sports memorabilia, license plates, photos and everything else you can think of that represents The Empire State were hanging or scattered around. The menu is out of this world. $3 mimosa's & BM's.. full bar, everything from Hot Dogs to Breakfast Burritos to Turkey Subs to Philly cheese steaks and so on and so on.. a little piece of everything you'd find from a street vendor in NYC.. and that by no means is a shot at their food. New York City vendors sell some of the most delicious culinary creations in the universe. 

Our waiter was super attentive and of course, I asked him what his favorite thing was. Bam. The Philly Cheese Steak, so I order one. This bitch of a sandwich was HUGE. It was like a Philly Cheese mountain, and holy cheesy steaky mushroomy oniony Batman it was delicious. Georgie S. was clearly being a fat kid that day and proceeded to order 4 things. Chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, a hot dog and, dammit, I don't remember the last thing. The Canadian went with the most boring thing on menu and got bacon and eggs.. But what does he know? Canada is useful only to provide me with furs and I don't even wear that shit anyway, so I guess that means its really good for nothing. (just kidding. (not really)). Everything was tasty and perfect for the hangovers we were all battling. 

This place is nothing fancy and is certainly not crap. I loved everything about it from start to finish, including the bill, which was about $40 for 3 people including 2 drinks each. Not bad Gino's. Not bad at all. See you soon, rain or shine!

So we took a gamble when selecting Scramble so please forgive my Scramble ramble. Ugh. So much potential. Friendly staff. But so so food and though friendly, an untrained staff. Upon entering I like the open and airy room. I like the railing along the east wall with great views of the mountains. But. Wait. What are all these people standing in line for? The host I'm sure. WTF? It's an order at the counter sit down with a number on your table kinda place. Ugh again. Not my thing. Like camping. Or hiking. Or that second Narnia movie. 

I'm with two people and they are ordering up their grub. Scanning the menu. Asking some questions. At one point my friend was ordering a blended coffee drink. The shelves behind the cashier were loaded with frape type powders. I couldn't believe I heard her say "Oh. Yeah. I don't know how to make those!" LMAO. I had grabbed some bottled Vitamin water so I was in the clear on potentially prepared beverage fiasco. 

When we sat the food arrived in a timely manner. Pancakes and sausage for me. Same for my friend. My other friend had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll. My side of eggs came out quickly afterward. 

I'm starving so I'm diving in to the fluffy (actually doughy) pancakes. I prefer a thinner flapjack with some slightly crispy edges. Sausages. Much like Phyllis Dillers's hoo haa..well...sadly they were dry. And I purposely ordered pork sausage cuz I wasn't in the mood for turkey. 

Now. I'm noticing my friend TRYING to cut up his pancakes. I cut as I go. But he likes to get everything all chopped up apparently. Now he's a big guy. It was hysterical seeing him trying to cut through those DOUGHY pancakes. He gave up midway. Needless to say neither one of us finished our cakes. 

Lastly he realized as he scanned his check that his omelette he ordered didn't come out because it wasn't even listed on the bill. 

So Scramble. You got potential kid. I felt the heart in the room. Just didn't get much from the brain.

What an amazing dinner. The service was excellent. I love how the server would repeat the name of each dish before it was served to you. The dining room was romantic but was well lit - it was not too dark or too bright.  

I ordered the Cookbook Tasting Menu ($118 per person)

Before we started our tasting, the chef gave us a sample of watermelon salad w/ goat cheese. It was a good summer salad. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but i was able to eat it - the goat cheese wasn't too strong, so it was okay. 

So now, onto the my Cookbook Tasting Menu:
1. Osetra Caviar Parfait - it had layers of alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, and potato shallot cake. This was all topped w/ Osetra Caviar. This was my 2nd favorite course of the whole entire meal. Everything was so fresh that this course got its own sweetness to it. 

2. Tartare of Ahi Tuna - I love how they presented this dish to me. They explained each ingredients and mixed everything together in front of me. This was a good texture dish, you got the freshness from the tuna, the crunchiness from the pine nuts, and the flavor of sesame oil and chiffonade of mint and a pinch of habenero. overall it was a good dish, but it didn't WOW me.

3. Main Lobster Pot Pie - my favorite dish of the night. Originially I thought this dish was going to be small with diced up lobster. But boy was i wrong, the pot pie was a good decent size, it came w/ a good portion of lobster, it was big enough to fill up that pot.  Aside from the lobster it came w/ some vegetables and black truffles. The sauce was so creamy and so flavorful - you can definitely taste the brandy - this was just amazing. It was rich, which made it filling, but oh man, i can eat another one by myself right now.

4. Kobe Beef with seared foie gras - the beurre rouge was an excellent sauce to complement the kobe beef. However the beef and the foie gras was so good on its own that I can do w/o the beurre rogue. It also came w/ two sides spinach and potato cake - those were just okay, the star of the dish was, of course, the kobe and foie gras. 

5. Tasting of Michael Mina desserts - Coconut S'more, was pretty good, but i didn't think it was that special perhaps it's just me since i'm not a fan of marshmallow to start off with. I wish it had more coconut flavor. The Mini Root Beer Float was really good - it had a REALLY strong flavor of root beer. If you like root beer, you will definitely like this sample. Opera Cake was topped w/ this rich dark chocolate ice cream - it was heavenly! i loved this dessert out of the three samples. 

At the end of our meal, they also brought us another plate of cookie sampler with macaroons, brownies, some butter cookies, and what seems to be peach jelly. These were really good! 

This whole meal was an excellent experience. From the service to presentation of each meal to the taste of each dish was just amazing. I enjoyed my meal a lot. 

I'd definitely recommend you order their tasting menu since it's just a few more dollars more than their regular entree and this way you can try other dishes.

Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.

Yes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.

I must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.

Now, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.

The desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)

Worth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.

Thumbs Up:
-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.
-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.
-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.
-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.

Thumbs Down:
-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's.

I don't just hand out 5 star reviews. ESPECIALLY after only one visit. But I have absolutely not a single doubt that I will be back for this incredibly fresh seafood. AND I DON'T EVEN EAT OYSTERS! We came on a Saturday night, and luckily since there was a fight going on, there was NO WAIT!! (note taken: come on fight night) After reading a ton of reviews, I pretty much had my heart set on the Signature Pan Roast with shrimp crab and lobster at about level 8 spice level, long before my arrival. But I also got a cup of New England style chowder first. Other than being along the coast in Oregon or Washington, best I have had!  This clam chowder was thick, with HUGE amounts of clams. Exactly what I expected. 
My bf got the shrimp scampi, and the stepson went with the Bouillabaisse. It literally had one of everything in there! Like a big fish stew! Even the sourdough rolls they brought to the table were great. And watching the chef cook your food, as well as others is the best part! 
My boyfriend is semi allergic to shrimp, and he still wanted to return for one of those beautiful lobsters.
The spice in the pan roast was perfection, however next time I will get one scoop of rice instead of two. It soaks up the spice which I am sure most people usually love. The chunks of crab and lobster were full of flavor! It will be hard for me to order anything else. 
The service was great, and in a casino you can't always expect that. Overall a wonderful place for good seafood and fresh shellfish!

After seeing a sign on the door for what felt like three years, Cornish Pasty is finally open and ready for business.  And the best news?  They have tons of vegetarian options!

Located in the same plaza as Thai staples Komol and Lotus of Siam, Cornish Pasty is a smaller space but cozy and inviting.  Think of it as a local pub with lots of good food.

Speaking of food, we ate a ton of it.  I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton soup (fyi: this is vegetarian/no chicken stock).  The cup is a good portion, and served with two large pieces of homemade bread and homemade butter.  It's a steal for $3.50.  Although I really enjoyed it, the Stilton cheese it might make the soup a little salty for some people.  As for the pasties, I wanted something more traditional and ordered the Cheese and Onion.  It tasted great and everything was cooked well, but I couldn't bring myself to use the ketchup or marina that came with it.  My husband had the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala and his was really good as well.  There was a nice blend of spices and it came with a side of mint-yogurt dressing that we both enjoyed.  

Cornish Pasty also offers a decent beer selection and a 14-oz will set you back $6. 

I loved the atmosphere here and all the employees were laid-back and friendly.  Cornish Pasty would even make a good spot just to grab a few drinks for an evening.  I can't speak for the authenticity of the food (which is questionable considering they offer a Mexican pasty), but I do know that I enjoyed what I ordered. The pasties are large and filling so make sure to bring your appetite!

Note to Vegetarians: They use Quorn in about half of their veggie pasties.  While being a popular meat-alternative in the UK, this was the first time my husband and I have ever had it.  I found it to be pretty much the same as most other faux-meats.  I'm sure they could leave it out of the pasties if you asked them.

Note to Vegans: According to their menu, they offer at least two vegan pasties daily.  

Note to Omnivores: If my vegetarian pasties tasted awesome, you have nothing to worry about.  And may I suggest trying a vegetarian pasty?

Great show!

This was our must-see show while in Vegas.  I'm a fan of them both & I enjoy seeing Donny & Marie on TV whenever they make an appearance. I made sure to follow their progress during their respective seasons of "Dancing with the Stars" and was exuberant when Donny took home the trophy. Using Tix4Tonight, tickets only cost $74 & change, which is 50% off regular price.  Saving cash money, bay-bee!

Seating - Our seating was at a table perpendicular to the stage with 3 chairs on each side.  I positioned my chair towards the stage so I wouldn't strain my neck by keeping my head turned to the left.  The seats behind us were semi-circle booths, the type you'd find at diners and burger joints.  The theatre only holds 500-700 people, so it was very intimate and everyone had a good view of the stage.  A little cramp in between seats, but not intolerable.  It's the only reason why I'm not giving the show 5 stars.

Show - Amazing!  I didn't know Marie had those pipes on her.  For one performance, she dedicated a song to her son, Michael, who tragically committed suicide a few years ago.  The song was "Pie Jesu" and I became misty eyed as I thought of her & her beloved son.  I defy anyone not to feel something in your heart when she performs this song.  

  Donny is a cardiofreak!  He kept up with his background dancers whom probably are more than half his age.  I know he won "Dancing with the Stars" and all, but c'mon!  He's a definite showman and has tons of charisma.  I can see why he was the Justin Bieber of the 70's.  

  In between sets, Donny & Marie would exchange witty banter, often times at the expense of the other.  They are, after all, brother & sister.  Quite a few times, they both went into the crowd to shake hands.  Marie even kissed quite a few men on their foreheads, leaving a lipstick souvenir.  She'd apply more lipstick and find another guy to plant another one on.  Unfortunately, I was too far for her to get to me :( .  

  Besides the lighting, there were smoke machines, confetti and giant screens to really make a memorable & fun experience.  

  This is a tremendous show, IMHO.  I don't know if I'd enjoy it as much if I payed full price, but by using Tix4Tonight  and saving 50%, I definitely think this is a can't miss show when in Vegas.  Highly recommend!

  Excelsior!

I went to polished based on my friend's rave reviews. I WILL NOT be returning.

First: I walked in without an appointment and asked for a pedicure, and they told me it'd be about 10 minutes before someone could get to me. That was fine, so I took my time perusing their color selections. After deciding on my color, I started looking at the gel colors. I have been getting gel manicures for a few years now, and I like to know what product is being used before I get one. I waited for the front desk assistant to finisher her phone call and asked her what gel product they used for manicures. Her response was "Well, we aren't allowed to say what products we use exactly." I'm sorry, WHAT?! I must have misheard her, so I asked her to clarify and she said "Yea, we aren't allowed to say what products we use, but I think the name of the product is on the samples" and then she waved me away. Fine. I won't get a gel manicure here. 

Next, the girl who was doing my pedicure took me to my chair. The water was lukewarm at best, and I told her, but she just kinda nodded her head. Whatever, I was pressed for time and just wanted to get my pedicure done. She puts on her gloves and files my toes. Next thing I know, she says something about cleaning and gets up and WALKS AWAY. I proceeded to sit in the now-cold water for TEN minutes. She never returned. I started asking the women who were doing pedicures around me if she was coming back, and no one responded. It was like I didn't exist. 

After ten minues of sitting there waiting for someone who didn't seem to be coming back, I gathered my stuff and walked out. About 15 minutes later, they called me on my cell phone, but I couldn't answer. They didn't leave a message. Perhaps the woman who was doing my pedicure finally decided to return and was shocked when I wasn't there waiting.

OVERALL: This place was busy and I'm sure regulars are treated well, but I will NOT be returning. The only good thing I got out of this was a free can of Coke.

Dear owners of Commonwealth, 

You built an amazing bar and a beautiful space.   Good beer and drink selection too.  It really could be called the crown jewel of the "new downtown".  Too bad you ruined it by running it like a douchey club that interferes with a patron's ability to relax and charges ridiculous prices.

The space you built is exceptional -- quirky design mixing elements of a lounge and upscale European chateau with laidback couches, chandeliers, a rooftop patio with an open air bar.  The drink selection is excellent -- great selection of beers and some nice creative cocktails.  After 5 minutes in your business, I thought it was a solid 5 star rating all the way.  

But why . . . why are you running this place like a douche magnet?  Why the hell would you build a lounge-like pub and then refuse to let people sit on the weekends without paying for "bottle service"?  Seriously.  Why the hell would locals ever frequent a place where they can't sit down without paying 1000% mark up on a bottle of liquor?  And putting a velvet rope outside with a bouncer to control access to your bar?  What the hell?  And no happy hour?  And no prices on the beer menu?  That's not classy.  It's just annoying.  I guess I understand wanting to hide your prices given that you're charging the tourist/rip off rate for drinks.   

I've visited your bar twice and I can officially say I'm done.  I won't be coming back and won't be bringing visitors.  You're absolutely a one-and-done type of bar.  Most everyone I know who's visited, has not gone back.  Too expensive, too douchey, too uninterested in wanting people to come back.

A piece of advice: in 6 months to a year when you're not the hip new kid on the block anymore and start to notice that your bar is pretty much empty until 9 pm (like Insert Coins), start making changes to encourage locals to be repeat customers: 1) Get a happy hour, 2) lose the stupid velvet rope, 3) let people sit down without buying $100+ of liquor.  Treat your customers like you want them there and don't just want to bilk them out of their money.  Start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and you'll bring the locals in.  Don't and you'll be closed by the end of 3-5 years.

Happy Hour Review:

When we lived in the northern Chicago burbs, we had a Mia Francesca near our house. It was always a special treat to go there, because the food was very good.  

Restauranteurs Scott Harris (Francesca's) and Phil Stephani (Tuscany) are two well known Chef entrepreneurs in the Windy City who competed with each other. Now Scott Harris has brought two of his Restaurants to Arizona, Mia Francesca's and Davanti Enoteca. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Francesca has a very upscale feel to it (photos). A lot of dark wood with some interesting lighting. It feels almost like a men's club. The bar area has a few small two person tables, along with some fours nearer the french doors along the wall and outside. It's very relaxed. 

When we arrived around five pm and we were handed regular dinner menus. We had to later ask for the HH ones and were reluctantly given them. 

The only server was the bartender Mike, who was doing double duty. It's somewhat quiet, except for the conversation of the customers. No background music, even the two HDTVs were on mute.  

CLIENTELE:
It's a mixture of young locals who work in DC Ranch and nearby homeowners in their 40s and 50s. 

MENU:
The dinner menus were as I had remembered them. Appetizers in the the $9-12 range and entrees in the $17-28 range. The HH menu had all of it's food item for $5.00, as were the drinks

SERVICE:
As I mentioned, the one bartender was the only server. They had three bus'ers who worked very hard at keeping the tables clean and refilling water glasses. One even tried removing my EVOO plate as I was dipping some bread in it. LOL

FOOD:
Francesca is known for it's marinara sauce, or gravy if you prefer. It's delicious and subtle. The only standout on their HH menu is their two meatballs served in a bowl with an insane amount of basil (photo).  

The Margarita pizza was dry, with a few rough cut mozzarella slices and tiny amount of basil. You can see from the photo, the sauce had dried up, while the cheese had barely melted. The center was slightly warm and the pizza wasn't hot. 

We also had the Roasted Pepper salad, with sun dried tomatoes and smoked mozzarella. The dish was overwhelmed by the vinegar of what I can only imagine was store bought jar of roasted peppers. It was unimaginative and tart. 

PRICES:
The Happy Hour prices were all $5.00. We also had two glasses of wine off the regular menu. A Hess Chardonnay for $7.50 and a Villa Antinoroi, which was a yummy blend of Sangiovese and Merlot for $9.00. Our bill total came to $34.32 including taxes, but before gratuities. 

It would have been nice to have given them Three Stars for the ambiance, but the food was nothing special. We may come back to Mia Francesca for dinner, but we will avoid the HH in the future and stick to Davanti Enoteca.

Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the dcor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.

For appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.

We also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. 

Next, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.

Finally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.

Antithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.

A friend and I checked out the newest Vegas club on opening weekend located at Wynn's new hotel and casino, Encore.  XS is by far the most beautiful and stunning club I've ever partied at.  This is comparing all the clubs I've been to in Vegas, from the Bay, and all the way down to L.A.  The amount of detail was highly thought out and nothing was left untouched, which help make XS simply amazing and unreal.  Steve Wynn has truly outdone himself with this club.

The club itself is huge and extremely luxurious.  Sexy curvy golden female figures are portrayed throughout the club in very good taste.  A huge rotating chandelier helps set the mood and highlight the dance floor.  Stripper poles are also staged all over the club, which helps intensify the sex appeal.  Similar to Wynn's Tryst, there is a huge poolside outdoor area, a perfect spot to cool down or catch some fresh air.  Though there is no waterfall, the outdoor area is much larger and elegant with plenty of seating & tables outside. One of the coolest things about the outside area is there are also gambling tables, mostly consisting of blackjack tables.

My only complaint regarding the club I experienced was the music.  First off, I didn't like the location of the DJ booth, which is located all the way in the back and is very hidden.  I spent a few minutes trying to figure out if there was a live DJ or if they were playing random cds.  Granted that we went on a Sunday night, but the music was horrible at best.  The transition between songs was way off and the selection of music was highly suspect and sucked. I know me and my friend couldn't have been the only people feeling this way with the music, because when I looked at other people dancing I noticed at times they would stop/pause as well.

Summary: Looks alone club XS is visual eye candy 5+ stars, but the substance (music/DJ) is only 1 star at best. I think I have to try another night because a few people mentioned the music was good on Friday and Saturday night. I hate to rate this place this low because I really liked the place, it's just I wasn't feeling the music and that's a big part of the experience.

Cinebarre, a movie theater chain that is tailored toward the grown-up crowd recently opened in the Arboretum.  The theater places restrictions on small children and minors under the age of 18 without being accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (sorry older siblings don't count), providing an environment free of crying babies and rowdy teens.  

In Charlotte, this concept of adult-only dinner and a movie at the same time was popularized with the opening of the Epicentre Theater in Uptown Charlotte a few years ago.  The opening of the Cinebarre makes it a perfect destination for people in South Charlotte, Union County, and those who may not want to go to uptown all the time to get this type of experience.

The look of this theater is very sleek industrial with a touch of nightclub lounge.  The waiters coming in and out during the film were not very noticeable.  This system is also conducive to outing loud speakers, obnoxious behavior, texters, and other disruptors without needing to leave the theater since you can just flag down a waiter.  Indeed this system worked for me during my outing as it stopped a person in front of me from endlessly texting (that backlight from the phone is a huge distraction for me).

It is recommend that if you plan on getting more than just popcorn (they use real butter), you should arrive about 20 to 30 minutes before the movie starts in order to have your food ready before the movie begins.  However, if you happen to come late or just as the movie is starting you can order food anytime during the film.  The menu offers a variety of different quality foods and beverages: 

*Domestic & Premium beers
*Red & White Wines
*Sparking - Sorry upscale people they don't offer Veuve Clicquot or Roederer Cristal, but they have Mot & Chandon.
*Sandwiches (named after famous movies) offer options for both meat-lovers and herbivores.
* Finger food, "The Replacements," that range in fries, chips & salsa, chicken strips, and popcorn to name a few. 
*They also offer breakfast on Sundays before 2:00p.m.
*Dessert options for the sweet-toothed.

There is a small kids' menu for when children can attend on "Cry Baby Day" every Tuesdays.

Ticket prices are comparable to many other movie theaters in the area, they also offer student, senior, and military discounts.  Plus, they have a $5.00 Tuesdays and on other days Cinebarre offers a Matinee discount.

Personally, I had a nice time and I would definitely come back to see another movie.  Come to Cinebarre and watch a movie over dinner, but don't forget to tip your server before you leave.  ;-)

This boba place has always been very close to my past few safe houses.  In fact if you were to plot the past safe house locations on the map, Easy Life Boba Tea will pretty much be in the middle.  Just an observation.

Anyway, there has been some recent activities on the fluffy snow ice scene in Las Vegas, with one opened by a celebrity chef and another by individuals completely off the radar.  If you are an active duty Yelp operative, you will likely know their names, employment history, and what they did last summer.

My visit to ELBT is to check out how the fluffy snow ice measures up to the new competitions.  So here is my report based on my observations and my order of a Large Mango Snow with Green Apple Jelly, Strawberry and Mango with Condensed Milk:

Sizes (3):
Small ($5.25 includes 1 regular and 1 premium toppings)
Medium (No show. Must be out of this most average & popular of container sizes)
Large ($7.25 includes 1 regular and 2 premium toppings)
Jumbo ($9.25 includes 2 regular and 2 premium toppings)

The Small is perfect for a snack for one. Large is big enough for me, but it is pretty much a meal replacement.  Jumbo is suitable for competitive eaters, but best shared with a few friends that does not mind cooties.  If they do, they can get their own Small or have a friend administers a cootie shot.  

Flavors comes in three varieties (Strawberry, Mango and Thai Tea), so if just competing on that simplistic variable alone, ELBT comes in with the least amount of "snow" selections. 

Toppings:  8 regular (Boba, Mochi, Pudding, Red Bean, Lichi Jelly, Coconut Jelly and Green Apple Jelly) and 6 premium (Mango, Strawberry, Kiwi, Banana, Aloe Vera and Coffee Jelly).  

Flavoring (aka Sauce): 4 to drizzle with (Condensed Milk, Chocolate Syrup, Brown Sugar Syrup, Caramel Syrup).

Again, overall number of selection to top off and customize your "snow" order with is not bad, but falls short of the competition.  But ELBT have the majority of the stuff I would want to order normally, so I don't care if they don't have gummy bears, Cap't Crunch, M&M's, etc. on their list.

Texture & Flavor:  Texture of the fluffy snow here is decent. However, you can still easily detect the slightly gritty ice crystals in your mouth, but it is a vast improvement over the offering at Kuma, but still not as perfect as Frost Bites Shavery (recently re-branded SnowFlake Shavery and relocated to their new brick and mortar location on Spring Mountain/Decatur in late Aug. 2013).  Flavor of the snow is good (but not made from all natural ingredients), not too strong or mild, but just enough.

Service:  High schoolers behind the counter, so your service mileage will vary greatly depending on the usual variables (cuteness, personality, your kicks,etc.)

So when it is hot and you want something to cool you down, and flavored snow dessert is what you crave, apply sun block (SPF40+) according to instruction and drive/bike/bus/teleport yourself to ELBT for a cool one.

Greater than A-OK.

Delhi Indian Cuisine has been on my radar for quite some time. I've seen the high reviews and wanted to check this place out. I'm so glad that I did because the food here rocks! (my socks).

The lunch buffet starts at 11:00am and goes until 3:00pm. It is one of the better priced Indian buffets in town at 9.99. I came in and ordered the lunch buffet. The dining room is very clean and spacious. There is a large buffet area which is loaded with tons of food.

The yelp check in offer was for either a soda or one of their house made lassi's, basically, a yogurt smoothie. They have a sweet one, a salty one, and a mango one. I ordered the mango. It was SOOO good. The flavor was very mango-ey and it was silky smooth and had a nice mouthfeel from the yogurt.

As for the food, I would recommend anything! I especially liked their chicken, all of their versions of them were super tender. The goat stew was especially tasty as well. It wasn't too gamey and the sauce on it was fabulous! There wasn't anything on the menu that I didn't like.

One thing that I thought was kinda weak was their garlic naan. I found the taste to be a little bit bland. And for their noodle, milk dessert was a little bit too sweet.

Service was also kinda questionable. They seemed to start out pretty slow with taking our orders and getting our drinks, and after our first round of dishes they didn't clear our plates fast enough so that we were stacking our plates on top of each other. But, they were quicker at bussing our table during the middle of our dining experience.

Would I come back? Oh, you know it, because I loves me some Indian food. And the food here is delicious, fresh, and tasty. And try the mango lassi, it's really good.

It's a quite a figurative slap in the face when you support a company through purchasing the product often, promoting the company on websites such as yelp, and getting to know the staff and even establish a relationship with the owner and then get a BRUSH OFF that leaves you feeling snubbed, and worse - unappreciated.

I get it.  The owner wants to enjoy his music.  The SAME music that was playing the previous night at the SAME very loud decibels.  I enjoy loud music - I WORK IN A CLUB!  That's fine!  

NOT at a coffee house.  Everything I loved about this place - the relaxed atmosphere, the chill crowd, the great place to sketch client work and play my DS - gone.  I spent years giving my money to great drinks, sandwiches, and conversation with the overnight baristas.  
Instead is pounding dubstep music, baristas who complain about the owner's repetitious music, and six dollar drinks.  Don't get me wrong - I will pay good money for great product that wants me there.  But after politely inquiring about the volume level being turned down and having a barista tell me no and the owner refusing to even look at me - I'm done.  It's not called entitlement - it's GOOD SERVICE.   I say hello to staff, order my drink, chat for a few minutes, and get to work, sometimes ordering a sandwich or snack.  Apparently, that's not enough to justify the music getting turned down.

Add this to my previous visit when I was accused of owing the store MONEY when they confused me with another customer whose card didn't charge, making me wait for twenty minutes while the staff ran around calling individuals, then finally made me a drink and sent me on my way.  Incredibly frustrating.

I'm frankly just disappointed in this establishment as this used to be a staple in my routine and I'm not returning anytime soon.  I'll give my money to Sambalatte or hell, the ItsAGrind down Durango.


EDIT: Be sure to read the owner's response.  There was nothing polite or professional in response to my review, my opinion, labeled "crying."  Lowering the volume to music that I ENJOY is a little is a "dramatic change" that is selfish and self entitled.  Really?  Again, disappointing on all fronts.

God help you if you're reading this review after you've booked a Spirit Airlines flight. If by some stroke of luck you're reading this before you buy, heed my warning: CLOSE OUT OF THE BROWSER NOW.

Ladies and gentleman, this for me was a lesson on the old adage: "You get what you pay for."

While I was stuck on the tarmac in Vegas, probably 100 yards away from my gate for 30 minutes after a 90 minute delay, I read reviews about how Spirit Airlines was the Greyhound of airline companies. 

This is an accurate representation of the flight. Everything seems old, I honestly thought the plane was going to fall apart a couple of times on the round trip. The seating is cramped, and you will be charged for anything under the sun.  Baggage claim was very annoying.

That amazing price is not so amazing after you add 70 bucks of baggage fees each way, plus 10 bucks to choose your seat (each way). Also don't bother choosing your seat. It really makes no difference, you are going to get screwed no matter what.

I told myself that If I won 600 bucks in Vegas I was going to just book a new one way ticket via any other airline back to Houston because I didn't want to experience Spirit Airlines a second time around.

At this moment, I'd give spirit 1 star because it was so bad.  Luckily they recovered for the return trip. Things went on without a hitch, kind of... There was still a delay, but it wasn't that horrible - typical really of any airline. I did feel like the plane was about to fall apart on take off and landing, but I guess I survived to tell the tale. Fine, you get 2 stars Spirit Airlines.

Bottom line: Make your trip to Vegas a fun one. Don't book Spirit becuase you end up spending the money you saved on baggage fees anyway. You'll also be annoyed with about 70% of the flight for various reasons.

tl;dr: This buzzfeed captures it perfectly: http://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/what-its-like-to-fly-spirit-airlines

I've never been inside an Ox before let alone a Blue Ox, but I dig it. Blue Ox is better than blue balls, blue eye shadow and blue anything else maybe. Babe knows what's up.

Blue Ox is a small dimly lit tavern that you probably pass every day. That's okay with  me. Keep passing it PLEASE. More Ox for me:) They do have regulars I'm sure, but I don't know any of them. My favorite group was this older man and I swear his sister wives. This lady had the longest french braid with the bumped bangs in the front and a shirt buttoned up to the roof. The other lady looked slightly more modern with a slutty skirt suit on. Definitely 3rd wife material. Not Boss like 1st wife. Other than that the crowd is all over the place from what I gather.

FOOD: All about them chicken fangers. Not to be confused with fingers. You have to say fangers because you have to say it with love cuz they are in a class above the entire universe of chicken fingers. They are the size of Arsenio Hall's big ass alien fingers. All white meat dipped in that crunchy beer batter made fresh to order. NOTHING BEATS THEM. They have different sauces to dip them in and always served with their homemade potato chips and house-made Ranch. The fangers are the star here, but there are other delicious items on the menu as well. Example: Grilled chicken salad. I try to stay clear of fried foods most of the time so I do get this salad loaded with chicken, eggs, tomatoes and all the other salad fixings I like. However, my cheat day breakfast item of choice is the Country Fried Steak. I have only had it once, but hot damn it left a mark on my heart and on my thighs. It's the size of the Hustler Club. Excellent homemade soups are bomb, too and the kitchen is open 24/7.

DRINKS: Dirt cheap. I want to say my guy had a tall, spicy Bloody Mary for $3. No drinks are over $5 that I have ordered. The bartender is quick and friendly. Hell, all the staff is super cool.

Did I mention the jukebox? Full of 80's, Dave Matthews, Blink 182, etc. I spend more money on the music then I do on the food and booze!  

Blue Ox is my bar. I come here and can set the mood with the music and always have a good time. Please, keep passing it by and leave it all to me:)

"The $17,000,000 Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace offers a feast that boasts more than 500 options and may well take the ongoing battle of Las Vegas buffets to a new level. Bacchanal Buffet premiered on September 11th after a complete wall-to-wall renovation from the previous Lago Buffet and will likely become a culinary mainstay like the Carnival World Buffet, which opened over two decades ago." - Chris Rauschnot, The Huffington Post

So good ol' rich Caesar decided he was bored of his crapLago Buffet [finally] and decided to do something with his endless stack of pure and unadulterated cash to fix the main culinary mess in his own backyard. Although having expected much less, pumping $17 million just means that from launch and to a certain extent of time...this buffet is going to be - for lack of better words - G.R.E.A.T. But this article also mentions the Carnival World Buffet (by the way, is no longer that great...) as a parallel, which serves one main point...this place will only be good for "so long". SO GET YOUR GLUTTON ARSE OVER HERE QUICK...while it is still this freaking G.R.E.A.T.

Service is great as the staff definitely display their enthusiasm to work at the "best buffet" in Vegas (loved how the cashier reiterated that to us SEVERAL times). Need refills? It comes automatically. Need your plates to disappear? No, you don't need to chuck it under the table...they efficiently disappear on their own - even if you're a speedy little punk like me (gone and back within a minute with another full plate).

So after coming here several times for both lunch and dinner, I would recommend lunch if you don't want to break your wallet since the difference between both meals is minimal. If you have the 24-hour-Buffet pass, please note that you'll need to pay an extra $16'ish bucks per entry.

Summary of my main LIKES (this is what I come here for):

- EVERYTHING AT THE CARVING STATION: really tender and juicy prime rib, fall off the bone baby back ribs, luscious lamb chops, sausages and more!
- Steamed crab legs
- Fresh raw oysters: one of few times I would recommend RAW oysters at a buffet (additional Japanese version at dinner)
- GIANT cocktail shrimps...holy crap, these are the 5-8/lb types!
- Ginseng chicken soup and Chinese BBQ (especially the char siew...gives Sam Woo a run for its money - now that's something)
- Cheese and prosciutto section (used these on my salads)
- Bottled fruit juices (lunch only)
- DESSERTS: non-sweetened desserts such as the cheesecake was a plus for me!

Caesar made the right decision with his "back-anal" (bacch-anal) investment and is definitely raking in the profits once again to Rome. 

I definitely RECOMMEND this Vegas buffet (for now - before it eventually ends up like Carnival World Buffet)!

I would not go back here if they offered me free car washes for the rest of my life!  A week ago, I filled up the gas tank of my Prius at the Chevron on Ray and Cooper, and they advertised a free car wash with purchase of 8 gallons of gas.  Perfect!  I filled up, got a hand-written receipt and took it over to the car wash.  The attendant at the gas station also proudly announced that he managed both places and that they were owned by the same people.
      My car was took about 20 minutes.  As I picked up my car and began to drive away, I noticed that the compass inside my car was in pieces, and not all of the pieces were included.  Then I noticed that my passenger side mirror was completed smashed and dangling from my car by the wire!  I turned around and returned to the car wash, demanding a manager's attention.  An attendant said he was going to get someone and told me to stay put.  This was at closing time, around 6pm on Sunday, June 8, 2008.  Since it took him more than 15 minutes, I went inside to follow-up.  Finally a manager came out with a clipboard and wrote down all the information.  I noticed at this time that the floor had not even been vaccumed, which was supposed to have been part of the package.  He assured me that someone would call me the next day and discuss the details.  No one had called by Thursday.
     On Thursday I finally got a call from a different manager, and that was only after I had called and left a message.  He told me the part had just been ordered and would be in by next week on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, the mirror that they had simply taped to my car had falled off again, and it banged against my car so hard when I drove that it scratched the paint off a little.  A week later, I got a call saying that the part had come in, and they asked me to come in on Saturday morning.
     So on Saturday, June 14, 2008, I came in around 10:00am.  I asked for the manager.  He came out and introduced himself as Dennis Struck.  I handed him my keys, and he got the mirror out of an office behind the counter.  He said it would take a little longer than he anticipated and that he would call me.  He took down my number.  I explained the paint damage.  He said "Don't worry about it; we'll take care of it."  He also said that he would give me another car wash if I wouldn't mind purchasing the compass replacement.  So I went home, hoping I'd return later to find my car good as new!
     No one called.  The next day, I called, and someone who was very rude said, "The car must be ready, because it was sitting out here when I came in this morning."  Fantastic!  What jerks!  So I came to get it.  No one had vaccumed the interior.  No detail had been done to repair the paint damaged by the broken mirror.  The mirror was attached and working, but that was it.  

    This was by FAR the WORST car experience of my life.  Also, this was the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever encountered.  Everyone from the ground up to the manager, Dennis Struck, should be fired and replaced.  They have a thing or two to learn about customer serice.  I am telling everyone I know not to visit this car wash, as they will do more damage than good, and they do not even keep their word about repairs.  Communication was also remarkably poor.  I hope they get shut down.  If you're reading this, avoid that car wash at ALL costs and the gas station next to it too!

I have been to this salon twice. The first time was only ok. I had an appointment and told the girl exactly what I wanted. When I got there I sat down right away. The girl was very brash and not very friendly at all. When I told her what I wanted (a full set, very short and natural and not thick. I asked if gel's were possible) she said she couldn't do the gels (even though I've had them before) and that she could do pink and white's. The reception and the nail tech went back and forth about whether or not there was enough time. I was annoyed because I had booked time for a full set so I knew I had t least an hour. Once it was all settled she got to work. I had asked for them short and she just didn't listen to me. They were way longer than I wanted. 

I went back in 2 weeks later for a fill. On a pink and white you sometimes needs the pink and the white done and sometimes just the pink. I had let them know when I booked the fill that I would want the nails short and that the white would probably need to be done. The receptionist told me no, the pink would be enough. So of course, when I went in...I didn't have enough time scheduled. I told them I would go elsewhere and they "moved some things around"

The girl who did my nails was referred to as "tiny" but I believe her name was tina.When we were discussing that I wanted my nails short she kept trying to change my mind ( so she wouldn't have to fill the pink and the white I assume) and i was very annoyed.  Once she started  it quickly became the most painful and uncomfortable fill I've ever had. She drilled so much that my fingers are sore and red now. And she kept pulling and bending my fingers even though I asked her to go easy. (my hands were sore that day).  Due to all the drill work my nails have lines and spots that are visible through the top coat,

When I checked out the receptionist asked how everything was and i said "not great". She waited a beat and looked and me and then said "what?" pretending not to hear me. I told her nothing. it was just ok. She didn't even ask why? She asked if I wanted to make another appointment and I said I would not be back. She said great have a nice day. 

Also while I was there, employees were speaking about other customers in a very unprofessional way and swearing. It was so uncomfortable. 

The fill was 38 dollars. I didn't even get an I'm sorry.

I do not recommend this salon. Nor will I return there.....

What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.

Went for lunch Saturday of memorial day weekend. Got there at 2 and the place was pretty full with at 15 minute wait for a party of three. But actually got seated in a booth in 10 minutes.
Service was pretty quick, I'd say within 3 minutes or less after seating. Got the drink orders in right away while we looked over the menu and the build your own configuration sheets.
I ordered the standard deluxe with white American, and their own house burger sauce, done pink. I also ordered the fries instead of the chips which come with.
Jody ordered the bison burger and Linda the Crab Shack.
Jody, who has been around and is hard to please gave his an 8 or 9 out of ten. That's a real complement. Linda said she loved the crab shack. Also we had two shakes, one just plain chocolate shake and Linda had the Espresso Love which sounded great and was except it was just kind of too sweet.

Funny thing happened while we were here when the power went out for a few minutes. Just a little added excitement.

Well we will all be coming back here again to try and work our way through the menu and all the options. This place is highly recommended by usens.

Level 107 Lounge is on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere Tower. That's the best thing ... and worst thing ... about Level 107 Lounge. The bar is great because it's near the top of the tallest tower in Las Vegas offering a vast 360 view of the city and dessert ... while it's bad because the Lounge is in the subpar Stratosphere. 

It earns 3-4 stars for a pair of reasons.

** Reason #1: Free
You can ride the elevator up to level 107 without purchasing a ticket to the top. Why pay $$ to go to the observation deck on level 109 when you can go to level 107 for free? The Lounge is close to the center of the tower and you can't get next to the windows, but the view is the same Vegas.

** Reason #2: Happy Hour BOGO
Happy Hour occurs twice per day at Level 107 and serves a limited selection of "signature" cocktails 2-for-1. Early Happy Hour is 4:00 - 7:00 pm and (really) Late Happy Hour is 1:00 - 4:00 am. Each cocktail is $15 and both must be the same. The 10 cocktails available for the special include Lemon Drop, Blue-tini, Cosmic Cucumber, Chocolate Masterpiece, Last Tango, Mango Madness, Summer Mint Margarita, Razz Jito, White Peach Margarita, and Summer Sangria. You can also get some appetizers for half price during the early happy hour.

My wife and I popped in for some happy hour drinks and to catch sunset. It was easy to get to the top and even easier to order. To see the LV Strip, sit on the side with the Bar. We chose $15 Chocolate Masterpieces with Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka, Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and White Chocolate Liqueur. Round 2 was two $15 White Peach Margaritas with Sauza Silver Tequila, Peach Schnapps, White Peach Puree, and Sweet & Sour Mix. Both drinks were SUPER sweet as you'd expect with names like that. It was happy hour and I was on vacation with my sweetie, so, I guess it was ok to throw back a few sweet cocktails, too.

Note that it didn't seem "required" that drinks were purchased either, so, I guess you could just go to Level 107 Lounge for the view (I think). Self-parking is free at the Stratosphere.

The view from the Observation Deck may be better, but instead of spending $18 for the elevator ride to the top, spend $18 ($15 plus tip) on a couple cocktails while enjoying the view relaxing in the Level 107 Lounge.

Prepared to be wowed when your plates of these Filipino dishes are set in front of you. I wasn't expecting my simple entree order of bbq beef skewers with garlic Java rice to come so nicely plated on a banana leaf. It also included a little side of papaya relish (Atsara). And the prices are insanely low for these dishes taken to another level. The elderly lady I held the door for as she went out looked at me and nodded and said Ma Sarap!! That's  good stamp of approval right there! She was right! My meal was really good!
 
New Owners!

The former bbq  place Full House BBQ has been transformed! It's now Full House BBQ...House of Manila Cuisine. Yes Filipino food with some bbq items thrown in!  Chef Alex and his team is behind all the cooking. He held the executive chef position over at Golden Nugget, but now this is his place along with the new cowners a family who moved here from the PI couple months ago. It's limited menu for now but what they offer tasted awesome! Location Smiths Shopping Center corner of Maryland/Silverardo. Your visual cue Cici's Pizza..Tokyo Discount. It's right between those two places. 
 
Along with my entree, I also ordered:

Siopao: (aka steamed pork buns, Manapua) is one of their featured items and made in house!  Breading just  fluffy enough to hold the filling. It's steaming hot when you cut into it, so becareful! The filling is packed with diced bbq pork asado mixed with a sweet hoisin sauce and they give you a little cup of hoisin sauce on the side for dipping too. This really could be a meal itself or a midday snack it's that filling.
 
Lumpiang Sariwa: The Lumpia appetizier I ordered  was more like a crepe with fresh wrapper filled with fresh sliced veggies! Loved this! It was topped with diced peanuts and garlic with some type of sweet sauce on the bottom. Hecka good!
  
Mami:  Another specialty of this restaurant and it's advertised as "create your own soup"  ..Choose a Noodle [thin wonton/rice noodle/wide egg noodle] Choose Your Topping [shrimp&pork wonton/soy chicken/beef stew/meatballs/fishballs] one topping sets you back $4.99! I requested an hard boiled egg to add to mine too. That's my creation ;)  Warning: It comes in a BIG bowl! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were al dente.  The way I like my Mami!
 
Turon: It's glazed w/ jackfruit and brown sugar and filled with sweet banana (Turon) and pieces of jackfruit.
 
Everyone was really friendly, my order(s) came out in a timely manner.For being a new place, it sure was fairly busy! The dining area felt spacious, says it seats 45 ...just go up to counter and they'll seat you if you are dining in.  Or you can order take out too.  Ambiance - felt more hip with the modern interior with clean lines. Even the dishes used are nicer quality.

They are adding more items to the menu. Kare Kare is one of them.
 
So of course Im giving this place 5 stars right off the bat.  Everything is cooked to order. That alone is a big plus for me.  Also you will surely get more than your monies worth here and leave with a full and happy belly!

Being in Vegas and not wanting to eat at the Casino when we got in, I had bookmarked Eat after reading all the great reviews from LV Elite Yelpers and had to check this place out. Well I was truly glad that I got our group to let me choose the Saturday breakfast. (They actually had no choice I was driving)

Eat is roughly about a 5 minute drive from the California Hotel making it really convenient. Waiting only 10 minutes after we arrived at 9:00am we were seated in this nice trendy hipster place in downtown. The sound level was a little loud with the music and people chatting but it didn't deter us from enjoying the food and decor at Eat. 
Some of the items we ordered:

*Beignets http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ#FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ Great item to share, jam and mascarpone made this dish yums.
*Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg#--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg  I swear the hollandaise sauce must be one of the best I ever had! 
*Pancakes with chicken apple sausage: My friend took one bite and busted out a huge smile. I got to sample the pancakes, melt in your mouth and a slight crunch on the edges of the pancakes made this dish a must.
*Eggs with smoked bacon and smashed potatoes: Smoked bacon was that standout of this dish.

*Outside seating available
*Street Parking
*Friendly Service

*Eat is a must for breakfast when staying in Downtown*

Me:  "Fatburger?  Never heard of them!"
One of my friends suggested, "I hear they're pretty good."
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.

I know that some People really love Dr. Wilson. That is why I went to her in the first place. I have tried to wait awhile before reviewing this, so my anger would cool down.

Some people that work in her office are nice. Especially one of her nurses.
I cannot remember her name,but she is older and blonde and perhaps German. She is the best person that works there.
The rest that work there all act as if they are doing you a favor by being there.
The worst is Shannon. She is beyond rude!
I had surgery with Dr. Wilson about 6months ago now. I had the worst treatment of my medical life from this Shannon. Everyone I have ever talked to about this and has had dealings with her has said the same thing.
My pain medication was never discussed just given to me (in prescription). When I asked about not having heavy pain meds, Just perhaps a relaxer. She actually started raising her voice to me and refused to explain anything.

When I did have the surgery, I went to the Piper Center. They were wonderful Thank you Jesus. I do not know what I would of done if everyone had treated me the way I was treated at Dr. Wilson's office.
 After my Surgery, the Dr. did not speak to anyone in my family about it. To say if I was dead or alive, nothing. They were all there in the waiting room.
They saw her sail out the door and never return.
Not only did she not come to see me and check on me in the hospital the next day, she sent no one.
When I asked the nurses when the DR. was coming so I could go home. They said she is not, she does not do it that way.
No one ever came to see me, no one ever called me, or emailed ,or sent a letter, Nothing! I had a serious surgery as well.
My dentist called me the day after a crown to make sure I was alright!

When I went back to her 6 weeks later, I said no one ever came to see me, or call me to see if I was alright. She (the Dr.) said we do not do it like that.
I understand that she is good at what she does, but no bed side manner here at all. Her staff is the same way. 
They treat you as if you are a Welfare case. Which of course I am not, everything was paid for in full.     But, no one should be treated this way for any reason.


Before I was even dressed from the exam, they were in the room preparing it for the next Victim. That happened 2 times! On 2 separate visits! I am not kidding about that at all. Just walked in the room 2 of them with the door open and started getting it ready.


I do not care how good you are, you cannot treat people like this. I would NEVER recommend this office to anyone. You would have better treatment at the VET!

Had our last dinner of the night before we left Arizona the next day. Boyfriend came across this cute place called "Pig & Pickles". We came on a Monday night of Memorial Day, assuming that everyone has work the next day, this place was pretty empty around 9pm. 

We did not know they were part of the Arizona Restaurant week, so we were curious of what they had for it. After overlooking menu, it was $30 per person for 3 course, so we each decided to get it and share.

First Course:
+ roasted bone marrow+green garlic & spring onion compote 
Two bone marrows were served under green garlic spring onions and a side of sliced bread. Delicious when you scoop some marrow onto the bread then add a bit of the green garlic spring onion and yum

+mushroom crostini+pistachio pesto
Mushroom crostini in pistachio pesto was served on top of two sliced toast. Mushrooms well sauteed and the flavors were good.

Second Course: 
+ the dump truck' - mixed lettuces, shaved veggies, seeds, cucumber and shallot vinaigrette 
Loved how the dressing was light and everything was fresh.

+wedge salad - bacon, egg, cucumber, tomato, radish and buttermilk bleu cheese
Not a bleu cheese person, however, boyfriend enjoyed it. You can request to put the dressing on the side. Crunchy wedges!

Third Course:
crispy skin chicken - bacony red potatoes, creamed leaks, arugula
Chicken was flavorful and very crispy. You just need to take a small piece of the chicken and eat it with the potatoe, creamed leaks and arugula.

+ pork porchetta - roasted pork belly, homemade sausage, creamed corn, heirloom tomato & arugula
Heaven in your mouth! A thick slice of pork belly wrapped around homemade sausage and served with creamed corn? The combination was just perfection. This is a must get if you love pork belly. 

Overall, we loved our meals and sure did get full off of it. The meals were big and we were informed that we can purchase one restaurant of the week and share among two people, so it'll save you some bucks.

I fell in love with the oxtail bone marrow fried rice when I visited the NYC location. You can only imagine the smile on my face when they told me they served it here in Vegas, as well!

Score!

We started the evening with a bottle of nigori, that drink gets me buzzing from the get go and at 19% alcohol on the Genshu Sake I knew I was in for a treat!

Our first dish was one of the restaurant's signature dishes kanpachi Yuzu which was delicate with a soft supple texture but with a nice acidic finish from the yuzu. Great start!

King crab truffle fried rice - dare I say I found a new favorite?!? I think I died and went to fried rice heaven!! The truffle added just the right amount of fragrant aroma to this drool worthy dish to make my mouth water and the moist and flaky king crab took it up to whole new level! AMAZEBALLS!!!

Oxtail bone marrow fried rice with egg - as deliciously magnificent as I remembered! Rich, flavorful and marvelous!!!!

Bone marrow - Rich, smooth with deep flavors enhanced by the accompanying sauce! You really don't need the accompanying bread but the contrast in textures are inviting!

Fried chicken - served nice & hot! Perfectly crisp on the outside and beautifully juicy on the inside! Finger lickin gooooood!

We were running late for a show so the thoughtful staff had us sign sealed and delivered before we could even say "check please!"

Overall, great food, courteous staff and cool hip ambiance! The prices are a bit high but what do expect? IMO, this a great place to dine if you're into Japanese cuisine/Asian fusion. 

Happy Eats!

How does one describe Holland Boone?

A couple of years ago, the AZ Republic had a 1/4 page advertisement for this eclectic place.  It looked interesting, so we decided to take a drive.  The dictionary defines eclectic as : "Deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources."  That fits Holland Boone well!

You see Holland Boone is a housewares store that has chairs, tables, bookcases, pretty real looking fake fruit, scented candles and aerators, knickknacks; they also have clocks (photos), stone figures and pewter.  Pewter of all types and sizes.  From serving trays, to baskets, to... well everything.  Actually, it was their first business.  

They began "in their garage in June of 1992. The thirteen thousand square foot show room also houses gorgeous one-of-a-kind furniture, Italian pottery, wall hangings and clocks, Mexican glass, seasonal decorations"  

Here's what they don't mention...  their prices are very fair and even better if you have a coupon.  Hint, hint, wink, wink, know what I mean?  Say no more! The bird may be dead, but it looks real at Holland Boone.  Apologies to Monty Python!

It's fun shopping at Holland & Boone and finding things you didn't even know you wanted or needed. LOL  Twice a year they have one of the best sidewalk sales I've ever seen.  It's held mostly under a tent, and they have free soft drinks and bottle water.  They even put out some comfy chairs for us guys while we wait. You could spend an entire day here!

We also would recommend signing up for their email coupon blasts: http://www.hollandboone.com/coupons.php

I used to go across the street to Grimaldi's, completely oblivious to Novecento's existence, but now that my eyes have been opened thanks to the check-in prowess of my Yelpers, this has become my top choice of pizza spots.
Let's begin with the easy, no-nonsense approach to ordering, much like you would a typical phone-in pizzeria you can select whatever toppings you desire on a base pizza you like...we like the Margherita Pizza...marinara, fresh mozarella, fresh basil, grated cheese, and EVO...AND we add fresh garlic and fresh ricotta cheese. Yes, everything is FRESH! The assembly line style ordering starts with hand stretched dough, then goes to toppings which are thoughtfully dotted on your pizza. Be sure to ask them to brush the fresh garlic oil on first, it makes it. Then the crust gets seasoned before it goes into the bright red HOT oven that bakes your pizza in 90 seconds!  At that speed why would anyone pay MORE and wait longer for average delivery pizza?
We also love getting either a burrata or caprese salad with our pizza. I can't seem to find burrata in most Italian restaurants, now I can get it at my local pizza joint! Oh happy day! 
The pizza has a nice chewy thin crust with bubbled charred areas, sauce is light and a little bit wet (but I don't mind) the cheese is perfectly melted and doesn't have that pool of grease from processed cheeses. We usually share a regular pizza between the 2 of us but you can eat an entire pizza and not feel that bad because it is so light. I wouldn't wait too long to eat your pizza because it does get soggy from the sauce.
The burrata is very creamy and rich, and it does fill you up a little. The other times, we opt for the caprese salad which is much lighter. 5 simple ingredients mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic and EVO...delicious.
Now I'm accustomed to paying a bit of a premium for a pizza and salad at Grimaldi's, but at Novecento's our bill for a salad and pizza is usually around $20...what a deal and we don't have to worry about taking home leftover pizza and the whole car reaking of garlic.

If you ask me what Yonaka is all about, two words: PRESENTATION and FLAVOR.

This place is one of those fusion places that bring different foods that you wouldn't think would be good together actually taste good. 

The PRESENTATION.
Doesn't matter what you order, when they bring it out, the first thing you think of is to take a picture. Then, you take a moment or two to admire the colors, the texture, and the usage of the dimensions of the plate. 

The FLAVOR.
OMG! As if the presentation didn't take your breath away, the taste will just do the opposite. You will find out you have way more taste buds than you realize after taking a nibble of any of their choices whether its an appetizer, main entre, or dessert. They even give you a complimentary palette cleanser to keep your tongue in check from the multiple flavors you will encounter. 

Now you're probably wondering what I ordered. Well, im still trying to figure that out too! I have been here twice. The first time me and the wifey ordered the 6 course Omakase which consisted of 6 of the popular favorite dishes. The second time, we did the Happy Hour from 5 to 6:30. If you refer to my pics, I have each one identified. If I actually typed up each thing, I will never get this review done. I will leave it up to you to decide what you think. Im just merely guiding you to this place. You know, you can lead a horse to water and so on.

But wait, if you go and eat here now, as a bonus, you will get some seriously awesome service! Your drinks will constantly be refilled, plates picked up when you are done, and then on to the next course.

How's that for a synopsis? Again, just when you think this review is over, they not only give you great service, but the overall dcor of the place will astound you! Did I also mention the bathroom? Its very nice. What's that word to describe the ambiance of this place? Oh yeah, its very MODERN.

Lastly, if you want to make a good first impression and want to be adventurous whether its your friends, family or that awkward first date, this place will impress them. I know I was with my first impression which brings me back to my intro. Once you try this place, you will know why I said what I said. Cheers!

Keeping it real.

That's what their sign says as you enter their parking lot from the corner of Green Valley Parkway & Horizon. After multiple visits to this wonderfully cute bakery, I'm now convinced they are doing just that, keeping it real yummy!

Layers is a mom & pops bakery, serving made-from scratch comfort goodies. They use all-natural ingredients in every cookie, cake, quiche, salad, sandwich and loaf of bread.  All our dairy, fruits, vegetables, nuts, meats and cheeses are organic, and their menus change seasonally.

Why do I love Layers?
- They'll modify their menu items upon request to fit any dietary need. Allergic to nuts, gluten-free, no soy? No problem.
- Great bakery selections. Cupcakes, brownies, cheesecakes, pastries, etc. So many delicious looking goodies!
- Custom cakes. Good flavors, some can even be made gluten-free. I ordered a carrot cake for a birthday. Hands down, the BEST CARROT CAKE I EVER HAD. And I've had a lot!
- Great service. All employees have been very helpful, friendly, efficient, and most of all, smiling!

That awesome carrot cake I talked about? I was running late and I showed up at 5:25pm to pick it up. They closed at 5pm. They gladly let me in, took their time, made sure the cake was to my liking. They probably didn't have to, but they did, which won big points with me! 

Pay them a visit and see for yourself!

Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. 

We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!

While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. 

We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!

Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! 

And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. 

OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!

Incredible meal and experience!   Bookmarked forever, I finally made it happen with a group because I wanted to try several dishes and needed lots of people.  My best friend from middle and high school came in from Boston for a short weekend visit.  Last year when she visited we went to Komol with Carmin H. and Cole R., and they wanted to join in on our Forte dinner with me and Eric R.  I made reservations for 7:00 and we were seated in the back corner of this artistic and funky restaurant and bar.

I ordered prosecco, Carmin H. and Nithya V. ordered angry ginger lemonade cocktails, Cole R. had a giant dark beer of some sort, and Eric R. got sangria.  We then ordered in waves and the food came out quickly and staggered perfectly.  Our server (Christina or Kristina) was fantastic.  She offered us a bread basket that was replenished upon request, served with olive oil and Bulgarian spices.

The plates were so intricate and pretty, all the way from Bulgaria.  Our first bite was the Shopska salad, with cucumber, tomato, and lots of Bulgarian feta.  Next was the squid stuffed with baby squids cooked in its own ink served on hot rice.  I loved the rice that came with it, a squeeze of lemon...delicious.  The squid itself was more room temperature but definitely tasty and unique.  On our server's recommendation, we ordered potato dumplings with fried onions.  I was shocked to discover that NIthya V. like my husband did not like potatoes!  Two crazy people exist!  Nevertheless, I went with the rec and all 5 of us ate one.  Both potato haters enjoyed these dumplings!!!!  They were scrumptious.

Eric R. ordered one of his fave things, hot meat stuffed grape leaves, also recommended by our grape leaves expert friend Mamie P.  They were very good.  Finally the dreamy bread (kachapuri) came, shaped like a boat filled with cheese, topped with egg, swirled at the table.  I cut this haphazardly into 5 pieces for the table and it was so hot, no wonder the egg cooked on it!  Sooooo good.

After watching Triple D, Nithya V. wanted to try the Thoracian clay pot.  We ordered 2 for the table, one with meat and one without.  I ate the no meat one and it was amazing.  The serrano pepper was legit with it, and I liked the combo of the cooked egg, tomato, peppers, and feta.  This is a must order.  Lastly, one of Eric R.'s favorite dishes came out, beef stroganoff.  We have only had this on egg noodles, so the dumpling/ravioli style made this dish unique.  I could taste liquor in the sauce, which can only be a good thing.

Overall, every bite of food I put in my mouth was tasty, fresh, and unique.  I would absolutely return with a group of friends to try more.  The vibe is funky, the service great, and the food special - you won't find this anywhere else in Vegas.

As someone who volunteered for this fiasco, rather than running in it, I noticed quite a few problems, which I detailed in a letter to Competitor Group. (No response, of course...) 

1) At one point I was asked to guard a barrier to ensure people did not get into the finish line area, and was told to send people the long way around (20+ minutes of walking, since you had to wade through all the runners exiting the secure area)... That would be fine, if they didn't try to keep family members from getting to their relatives in the medical tents when there were emergencies. I actually had to get an EMT to override a staff member's decision to get a man to his wife in Medical Tent 1.

2) A man face-planted right near the finish line, and was having a heart attack. Medical personnel was called apparently, and no one showed up for several minutes. A man came up to me panicking about it, and I actually had to track down EMT staff to go help the guy suffering from a heart attack. 

3) Staff members constantly gave conflicting information. This was nothing short of a cluster-fuck. 

4) Volunteer coordinators at the booth were rude and unhelpful. After asking 3 times where the group I had come with was, I finally said to the person "I'll go find them myself." because she kept trying to herd my husband and I into a fenced off area behind the volunteer tent. I later found out that they had kept several people here for well over an hour... so much for being understaffed on volunteers. They also repeatedly yelled and screamed at volunteers who arrived later during the marathon due to their work schedules. 

5) The secure area was very small, and shortly after the first few people crossed the finish line, there was a huge wall of them coming through. This has been complained about in enough reviews. 

6) Volunteers were lied to by Competitor Group. We were promised a "delicious dinner buffet at Mandalay Bay" for our efforts. What we actually got was not being informed about the food being put out, and it was just some stone cold/rock hard pizza, cold chicken fingers and some room temperature coffee. 

7) Staff were unaware of what races the handicapped marathoners were running, and so volunteers were instructed to rush over to them and give them their medal when they arrived... except... they were given half marathon medals when they did the full marathon. Very disrespectful. 

I definitely do not think I'll be volunteering there again. I feel even worse for the people who paid money to participate in this... :(

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

I was really craving a "nice" dinner somewhere and my new Vegas friend and I decided to try out the buffet here since we heard good things from other people about it. Also I had gotten kicked out of the Wynn earlier in the day and it really made me want to walk around inside in a spiteful and evermorecurious manner. 

Downsides:
-It will cost you upwards of $40 bucks for dinner.
-Lots of nuts in food, but they have labels for food allergies! 
-After partaking of the lunch buffet at Paris, I felt the selections here weren't that different. 
-Only power outlet that I could find was in the bathroom. (You don't want to know. Or do you?)
-King crab legs were still frozen :(
-Sushi sucks, no sashimi at all unless you count the smoked salmon sitting on a tray in a different section.
-Prime rib was better than the buffet at Paris and it was tender and more edible, but lacked flavor. Maybe I'm meat spoiled. 

Upsides:
-Beautiful beautiful decor!
-I got to try rabbit, which I can't remember if I've had before but I would like to say that I have. So let's say I got to resample rabbit. 
-Lots of choices.
-Beautiful dessert selection.
-We got to traumatize an older couple sitting next to us. Muhahaha.
-Silverware and table settings are still in new condition. It sucks to eat somewhere that has ratty utensils. Just saying.
-Our server was great with her timing. She would come by to clear plates and refill drinks without being gone too long, or checking up too frequently. 

Overall, it was great. I wish I could have eaten more and that I got to experience it without having buffet for lunch so I could have appreciated the food more instead of comparing.

This is another great restaurant in Aria.  I have been wanting to try this for two years and I finally went tonight.  I got the 5 course Signature Tasting Menu and it was great excellent!!

The bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.

Coure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gele with some crme fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gele filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gele,

Coure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  

Course 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  

Course 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.

Course 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.

Comments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.

I did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.

The staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.

I liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.

** Begin Rant:  Guys, this is not a restaurant to wear t-shirts even if they are for Azuza Pacific U.  Dress up a little, please!  And for two other guys, wearing a ball cap at any restaurant during dinner is NEVER correct.  Show some class.  John Deere no less.  ** End Rant.

Jean Georges is a restaurant to which I'll return.  Truly 5 stars!

***Not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas (though still pricey), Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***

Despite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in Las Vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is located on the casino floor of the MGM hotel, so convenient.  I believe it is open all day and Wolfgang Puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.

Despite its convenience, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  Most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but I have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good Vegas restaurants put out.

Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  It is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  Maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  The decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.

We started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) potato chips, which were topped with a chunky and rich Maytag blue cheese sauce.  The housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  Overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.

We also shared the Chinois Chicken Salad, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a Chinese mustard vinaigrette.  Overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original Chinois Chicken Salad from Chinois on Main in Santa Monica.  The reason was that the salad was over dressed.  It kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).

For my entree, I had the BLT, which included maple glazed pork belly, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  The pork belly was sweet and flavorful.  I thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the pork belly here lacked that tender texture.  Instead, the pork belly's texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  It was still good, but I would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) pork belly over the spare rib-like texture here.

The lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  Like the potato chips, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  I was not a big fan of the sourdough.  The bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  The BLT came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.

I tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  I had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at Drago Ristorante in Santa Monica.  The pasta dish at Wolfgang Puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  That being said, I liked Drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.

Service was very good.  The waiter Jeremy was a very nice guy.  He was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.

Prices for lunch were okay.  There were several options here that were around $20 or less.  You would pay about the same at some of the Las Vegas cafes, but I imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.

Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  I've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a decent and safe option for lunch in Las Vegas.  

The MGM Grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).

It had been over a decade since I last stayed at the MGM.  Came here during Yelps Spring break and was hoping to get into one of the newly renovated rooms but I ended up in the regular ones.  It was the same weekend as the Billboard Music award.  Too bad I didn't see any celebs.

We got the first room right off the elevator.  I was thinking it was going to be noisy with all the peeps coming and going and the up and down of the elevator but it was actually pretty quite.  The 2 queens size beds were comfortable and the room spacious enough for 2 people.  Big bathroom with plenty of counter space for all the hair and makeup stuff.  

On the evening of the 2nd day we were surprised with a special delivery of champagne and sweets.  We almost made the guy leave stating to him that we didn't order anything LOL.  Well he got our names right and it was a little something from the hotel to welcome us.  

Im not very picky when it comes to hotel accommodations.  As I don't tend to spend much time in the hotel room.  As long as it had a comfortable bed, a TV, nice size shower with good water pressure Im happy.  That said the one thing I was disappointed about was the WiFi.  It was struggling a bit.

Local ~ On the Strip
Room ~ 2 Queen beds and on the 18th floor.
Stay ~ Clean and comfortable.
Extras ~ WiFi struggled a bit.

The chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.

The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.

I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.

My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.

I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.

Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.

1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth

2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi

3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce

4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce

5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu

6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell

7. Eel with shisho pepper

8. Uni with egg

9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce

10. Mixed tuna over rice

11. Panna cota

As you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat.

 I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.

Service was always with a smile all evening.

The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.

Arigato, Aburiya Raku!

I'm going to start by telling you my masseuse had to take a dump in the middle of my massage. It was disgusting and I couldn't stop laughing.

Now I'll start from the beginning.

Looking for a cheap massage for my homegirl's bday present, she found The Foot Spa w/ a Yelp Deal: $28 for detox foot bath and massage. We sat in the parking lot while we made our purchase via cell phone (crazy things the phone does these days!) and then walked through the door. We were seated in the dark with the exception of the bright flat screen t.v. playing a football game in our face. I waited about 30mins before I finally asked if they would turn it off.

We sat there for 15mins before anyone said anything to us. The kitchen/breakroom is nearby, so we heard someone warming up their food in the microwave, eating it really fast, and then coming out to service us. The older Chinese dude came over to put his grimy hands on me and I could tell from the smell of him that it was his ass that was eating.

He stuck my feet in luke warm water with a giant machine attached to it and threw a piece of paper on my lap that explained what the detox was. It was gibberish and my feet started to hurt really badly. Scary.

He started my massage and all I could hear was his bubble guts. Then while I was laying back with my eyes closed I heard him scurry off really fast and slam a door shut. Sadly, there is only a very thin wall separating the massage space and the toilet, so all my friend and I could hear was him blowing his cakes out. I didn't hear him wash his hands. He just walked back over and continued massaging me. I didn't say anything purely out of humor.

In the middle of the massage another woman kept turning the light on and off and making a lot of noise. It was distracting, not relaxing at all. Though my friend seemed to enjoy her massage, I thought it place was a goddamn joke.

I am the 697th review for Pizzeria Bianco, so what on earth can I add that hasn't already been said? Well, most of the reviews say that the wait is several hours long, which used to be true. In fact, several years ago, I actually waited for about an hour and a half. However, just recently, we walked through Heritage Square on the way to the ballpark. It was 6:30 PM on a Friday night and there was no way we ever would have imagined there would be room for us to dine. However, when we walked by, we noticed two spots at the bar. Could it be? We walked inside and yes, it was actually true! There were two seats at the bar just waiting for us. We couldn't have planned it if we tried, yet there we were sitting down on a Friday night at Pizzeria Bianco without a wait. I think this happened because Pizzeria Bianco has been open for lunch for awhile now and there isn't the excitement of waiting in line for them to open the doors at 5:30 PM. Whatever the case is, I think it's important to note that you might not have to wait for the two hours anymore...I think it all depends on the night. 

Food wise, I will second what so many of these reviews say. I really, really like the pizza here and the Margarita pizza is a number one best seller for a reason. It has this buttery taste of perfection with every simple bite. The salad was so fresh I thought something was off, until I realized that I just hadn't ever had such fresh lettuce before! I wouldn't wait for two hours to eat here, but if there's room to sit without a wait, then I will definitely eat here again in the future.

I went with another company when I first moved to Vegas and it was weird! One day the guy disappeared off the face of this earth and never showed up again. Didn't call, send me anything, never to be heard from again! Soooo... Yelp failed me on that one and it was back to the drawing board again. That's when I found Pitbull Pest Control because of all the great reviews they have on here.

Chance is the name of the guy who does my exterminating with Pitbull and he's great! Very thorough, always wearing a smile. He shows up on time like clockwork once a month. 

A little while back, there were black widows near the mailboxes and I got worried because I have 2 little dogs that I really care about. I was scared because I heard that when those spiders start multiplying they do so quickly and someone said that they could start hiding out in my bushes. I envisioned my dogs getting too close and getting bitten which would kill them and no way I'm gonna let that go down! Not on my watch! 

I called up Pitbull Pest Control and the next day they sent someone out free of charge to spray that area. Great company! 

I love that they have the organic stuff that they can spray on the inside and that all of their stuff is pet-safe. They have been my pest control company of choice since a little after I first moved to Vegas thanks to my discovering them on Yelp and I've yet to have an issue other than the black widow thing. And that wasn't even on my actual property line so technically it was nothing wrong that they did and not their fault. I'm just guilty of being an overprotective dog mommy and decided that you can never be too careful. I'm thankful they still obliged me. And for that I give them 5 stars. 

Plus, now that I can officially count on them, my abandonment issues I had from the last people up and vanishing have gone away. No years of therapy needed. Haha! Dr. Death was his name... I still wonder to this day if that dude died or something. So strange!

I decided to check out Commonwealth for its opening weekend and I'm glad I did- this place is amazing!  Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.

Get your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.

There is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.

To get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.

The crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.

We got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.

What made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?  Was it the friendly crowd and staff?  Was it because they stole my iPod to create their music playlist?  Maybe it was just the cute boys in suspenders?  Well, whatever it was made me fall pretty hard for Commonwealth and I'm anxiously awaiting our next date.

I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.

Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an "international burger" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over. 

I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind.
And that's something....

For my 500th Review, I wanted to share my experience at a cool club at the Wynn. I finally came here after going to most of the clubs and lounges in town including, XS, Marquee, Tao, Lavo, 1OAK, Rain, Playboy, et al.

Tryst is located near the entrance to the Wynn.  Just make a quick right after you enter the hotel.  I really liked this club because the staff was chill, the clientele was friendly and the place was not crowded on a Fri night in early June.

LA Riots was deejaying and was dropping some down beats.  LA Riots in known for introducing a blend of Indie Rock, Alternative Dance & Electro music in 2007.  The bartenders were really cool and poured some stiff effin drinks!!!  There were at least three bars and we didn't have to wait long.  The bouncers were chill and present, but not "overly" present.  Lastly, the valets in the restroom were excellent:  5 Stars.  The ambiance is very nice.  You walk downstairs and the hallway leads you to the main entry to the dance floor.  There is a stage for the dj, two separate platforms for the two dancers and a waterfall & pool in the backdrop.  There is also a pole for the amateurs to try out too - LOL!! -http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LuRoNUSPwGtPQMe5gDF7sw&userid=o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw.   Lastly, there are a couple of outside areas to get some fresh air:  5 Stars.

Tryst means a meeting place, and it wouldn't be true if my friend and I didn't meet some ladies.  We met a couple from Chicago who were very nice and kept us company.  They were not ratchets, they were cute, and they could carry on intelligent conversations.  As for what happened later, well like Lil' Wayne's lines from Love Me (Drake)

And I would say these girls' names
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges, man!

LMFAO!!!!!

Bright lights. Shiny things. Grand opening signs.  Girls that look really good in yoga pants.  I can't explain why, but I do know that these are just some of the things I am hypnotically attracted to. Kinda like the blue alien from the planet Baab (Escape From Planet Earth).

So after a recent Yelp Helps event followed by a group dinner at Ramen Sora, I was ready for some sweets to end the day. But it was past regular business hour at SnowFlake, so I was really drawn to the bright lights through those large windows emanating from what I soon discovered to be a new dessert spot in Chinatown.  But I was too late. the business has closed for the day, and the cashier lady was already counting the register and getting ready to leave.

So 2 days passed and another Yelp Helps event, this time benefitting the Ronald McDonald House charity, plus an amazeball CMYE in Downtown Las Vegas.  And I finally made it to this new Vietnamese dessert spot while it is still opened. The interior is very clean, brightly lit and has some comfy looking couch seating near the back. Their menu is pretty extensive.  Offering Vietnamese desserts, blended coffee, milk tea, smoothies and cold and hot beverages.

Tonight I was most interested in checking out their Vietnamese desserts (Ch). After a brief glance at their menu I settled for the trusty #1 Bambu Special, which is made with young coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seed and coconut water.  I really enjoyed the longan and slurping the basil seeds and pandan jelly, but I thought the crushed ice diluted the coconut water too much.  I barely tasted it.  What I did like is the fact that they use good ingredients and fresh when available.  

What I like:
* Use of quality ingredients.
* In Chinatown next to Hot 'n Juicy (the location closest to Decatur).
* Clean!!! Or at least the appearance of being clean.
* You can customize the desserts adding or removing ingredients to suit your taste or craving.

What I didn't like:
* Too much crushed ice diluted the flavor of the dessert drink I ordered.
* Parking lot is tiny and usually full.  Must be all the massage customers.
Street parking on the side street is usually occupied, so you can find parking but will have to do more walking.

I will definitely comeback to check out other menu items, but for now I am only going to rate them worthy of 3 stars.

Great Little Bar Tucked Away Inside the Luxor Pyramid in Vegas

SITREP

"Aurora", the "Goddess of the Dawn", so aptly named since on one occasion, I think it actually was almost dawn when we left after late night Karaoke activities ending at 3am.

THE SETUP

We actually cabbed back to the Luxor after Bazil's, but still a bit too wired to go to sleep and this place was still open.  Wait.  Let me rephrase that.  It's ALWAYS open.  Jesus - 24 HRS!  [This is SOOOO not Sacramento.] ;)

WHY I LOVE VEGAS

That's the remarkable thing about Vegas I still have to get to used is that most bars don't close - they are open 24 hours!  That's actually the thing I hate about bars in Sacramento, and even San Francisco & Seattle (my favorite Cities) - the bar security will go around and grab your drink at, what (checks his watch) 2am or even 1:40am and take the $10 drink you ordered that is still half full (because I am a sipper who likes to savor my martini or cocktail) - or forces you to down the top shelf goodness like it was some cheap shot.

TRIANGULATION 

Located across from the lobby's front desk, Aurora can be that first distracting stop (as it was with me) before you get back to your room (and often a couple hour detour).

MY DRINK

Anyways, this was a fantastic chill spot.  As far as drinks go, I'm basic with a Rum & Coke, and it was great to see that this drink is cheap - commensurately speaking - when compared to other cocktails here as anywhere.

LUXOR-DECOR

Nice to watch people doing the table top games nearby, but just as interesting is the lighting-effects inside the bar on the ceiling.  And though the name-antecedent originates back to "The Dawn", in this instance, this bar's use of the name "Aurora", more specifically references those aforementioned lighting effects reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis or "Northern lights". 

THE LOWDOWN

Aurora has a great chill Vegas vibe, and if you don't really want to be in the Casino areas, Aurora had for me a fun environment  [Where I could enjoy my drink and have fun flirting with a group of ladies from the Czech Republic, whose biological clocks were still on Czech time, and so they were "up" already.] ;)

I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a "cleaning" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

Located in a small stripmall near the North East corner of Southern and Central Ave. Is this small buffet. When you enter, you have walk down a small walk way and then are met with a cashier who takes your drink order and counts the number of people in your party. You'll then claim your table and serve yourself. All the usual hits and misses of the average Chinese Buffet are here - none really stand out in all honesty. 

They are all pretty average and then came 'the incident'...

I'm still traumatized by it. Seriously I am... I went there and it felt like any other time. I had gotten a chicken dish of somekind. i don't really recall. and I started eating it and it had a very odd taste. I didn't know what it was, it was like chicken... but not really. I then started to eat the rest of it and then I saw different bones that I have NEVER found in chickens before. I couldn't even identify which part of the chicken it was and the meat was very tough and then it hit me.... THAT WASN'T CHICKEN!!

I almost threw up right then and there! I barely made it in time to go to the bathroom and vomit what I had eaten of my faux-chicken. Now I have NO idea what the hell it was that I ate. I tried to ask the cashier and she insisted it was chicken, but then she reluctantly said that it wasn't and when I demanded my money back she quit talking and wouldn't say exactly what the hell it was! 

The owner came out and started yelling at me and started yelling in Spanish (there is nothing quite like Spanish in a thick chinese accent!) and wouldn't stop even when I told her that I don't speak Spanish and then I realized she wasn't yelling to communicate with me, but with the other patrons who were starting to look at their own food with concern. I got my money back and bolted out of there and have NEVER gone back!!

"All we need is because, come and party with us "

The Montelucia was an amazing venue for our "destination wedding" weekend... The majority of our guests stayed on-site and although we live only ten minutes away, we checked in for the weekend as well.  The staff was friendly and extremely accommodating.  Ever since our initial meeting with Courtney back in February, I was sold.  Courtney was our go-to gal throughout all of the planning stages up until the event.  She worked with us on room rates for our guests, ceremony and reception details, menu, bar, decor, and more... She's since been promoted and Kelly was brought into the picture, but it was a seamless transition.  

Sure, I could nit pick about a few of our guests not receiving hospitality bags, housekeeping coming in crazy early to clean rooms, or the fact that the sorbet (intermezzo course) was served prematurely and melted before most were able to enjoy it... but these things are to be expected at such a large scale event, and I'm extremely satisfied at how the weekend went.  (Besides, I'd much rather everyone be getting down on the dance floor than sitting down eating)!

Our guests enjoyed the pools, the service, the rooms, the spa, yoga classes, Prado, Crave, Kasbah, and more.  The wedding itself was amazing as was the Sunday brunch that we had poolside.  The bell staff were fabulous and there are a few other staff that went above and beyond that I must mention by name:
-Aleisha, the concierge - she was overly friendly and helpful throughout the weekend; especially on our wedding day when we needed a last minute place for make-up.  She also brought us much needed bottles of water and was super sweet to Minnie!
-Tom, Joya Fitness Director - he allowed us to use the spin bikes to have a private little wedding day spin class that my friend Karle taught... it was the perfect way to start my special day!
-Julio - my personal butler for the day... Julio was there for any and every request that I had... he provided the most amazing service I've ever had including fulfilling my requests for water, safety pins, salted nuts, a steamer, wine, champagne, and I'm sure so much more!

If I could have my wedding all over again, I wouldn't change a thing... (OK - maybe I'd change the weather to be just a tad cooler).  But one thing is for certain: the Montelucia was a fabulous venue to have our wedding at and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an incredibly special place to spend an hour, a night, a week, or more.  If you haven't been yet, go check it out - I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

NEW PHO SHOP! (1/18/2012)

After first seeing the signs for Pho House getting put up a few weeks ago, I knew I had to try this place immediately. This part of Phoenix needed a little Vietnamese dive. Every time I'm sitting at home and have a pho craving, I always have to think in "miles away." It's not always convenient to have to drive ten plus miles for a decent bowl of pho (and by not always, I mean never).  

Well, I had dinner there tonight and I can already strongly recommend a bowl of their pho dac biet! Consistency will be key, but the broth was definitely one of the better  pho broths that I've had in the city. Along with the pho, I tried a spring roll and an egg roll. The spring roll was tasty and fresh, and the egg roll was crunchy and delicious! I'd order both again. If you've had good spring/egg rolls at other Viet spots, you'll know what you'll be getting. Oh, and one more thing... no chili oil as of yet. I'm sure that could change in the future, but I was a tiny bit bummed.

I think Pho House is totally starting on the right path with its food and friendly service, and if they keep it up, I could see it being a busy little neighborhood restaurant. It's really in a perfect spot that lacks close competition. C'mon, Arcadians and East Phoenicians, go try it and write a review!

How does one start their Centennial revue? Which venue does one choose to mark the occasion? How many other factors can possible come together to make this the hardest revue of my Yelp career?

...and will I ever be able to regain my sanity?

I am told that a great work of art is never truly finished, that the work never ends. After just one visit to Soho Japanese Restaurant, I now understand what that means.

Clearly the great Yelpers of Las Vegas have collectively cried out the praises of this understated little gem in the southwest valley. Not only does it rank top among sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it ranks tops among ALL restaurants in Las Vegas. That little tidbit has to be making some of this town's "legendary" chefs red in the face. Someone should tell those people at Michelin they are dinosaurs - no wait, never-mind, let them figure it out.

You see when it comes down to it, it's quite simple - if you do something great, people will notice. And it's clear, Soho does great better than anyone in Vegas.

The first thing you notice when you walk into Soho is that no world renowned restaurant decor consultancy group was brought in to "class the place up", like they do in most 5 star restaurants. Soho is a simple, friendly, comfortable and welcoming environment - a 5 star restaurant that won't make you feel like you're not good enough to be there (what a concept.)

The staff are regular people, just like you and me. But management is obviously treating these people with a little respect because it's quite clear they all love working there - it shows in absolutely everything they do. Imagine great service at a 5 star restaurant from friendly people who don't look down their nose at you (are you guys starting to see a trend here?)

But you really don't appreciate how good you have it until the food arrives. It's easy to get so comfortable here that you can forget you are about to partake in one amazing meal. All that changes once you take the first bite. For us it was the Uni Trio - just Wow! (Thank you sir, may I please have another.)

I know what you're thinking, what does a boy who grew up in Fargo, North Dakota know about sushi? Wouldn't he be dead last on the list of people you should trust on the subject? (Hey Buddy, you forgot to cook this!) 

Fair enough.

The truth is, you're just going to have to decide for yourself. No amount of banter from me is going to change your mind,so I'll leave that up to the marvelous people at Soho, they are better suited to the task. 

Whew! One hundred down, and ready for round two. Go Yelp!

***Twist delivers contemporary French cuisine; it is good for Vegas but still a notch below top SF and Chicago spots***

Twist is yet another Vegas fine dining restaurant from an internationally acclaimed chef like Robuchon and Savoy.  Twist is newer though.  It is located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin hotel.  Being newer, I was hoping for more contemporary cuisine than what I've had at Vegas' other fine dining French restaurants and Twist delivered.

Twist features a lot of good (and modern) food while still showcasing French ingredients and cooking techniques.  Twist offers several dining options.  You can go for a more value-centric 3-course dinner.  You can also order a la carte where you choose from elaborate plates that feature proteins in multiple interpretations (the multiple presentations of foie gras sounded interesting) as well as big Prime steaks.  Finally, you can opt for one of their tasting menus--a vegetarian option or their seasonal tasting menu (available in 4 or 6 courses).

I opted for the tasting menu and it started off very well.  First came a series of tasty amuses.  There were lavash breadsticks with albacore cream and bonito flakes (pate-like in richness), an almond sable, very good goat cheese sandwiched between two light and crispy crackers, and a really good Guinness and Jack Daniels gelee rolled in gingerbread (great burn but also sweet--reminiscent of the cocktail gels at LA's Providence).

The bread was also good (several warm options including a warm bacon and smoked cheddar roll, a crusty French baguette, a too dense brioche roll, herb and feta, and cherry pecan bread).

My first course was sea bass and haddock carpaccio with citrus and horseradish ice cream.  The fish was good--moist and soft--and went well with the citrus and herbs to give it freshness.  The horseradish ice cream was very creamy and had a noticeable horseradish flavor without being overpowering.

My second course was easily my favorite of the night.  It was foie gras ravioli next to seared langoustine in a herb and coconut milk broth (topped with crispy mushrooms).  The foie gras ravioli had a thick pasta skin as well as creamy, buttery and savory seared foie gras at the center.  The langoustine was very nicely cooked--fresh, lightly sweet, plump, and soft.  The broth was very aromatic.  This reminded me of the buttery foie gras ravioli at Providence and the perfectly cooked langoustine at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon (two very good restaurants).

Next up was a fish course and it was disappointing.  It was turbot and the fish was a little tough and not easy to flake--definitely far from Baume's soft and flaky turbot.  Worse than the slightly tough fish was the grapefruit (very acidic and bitter).  This felt like something that maybe should have came earlier because the acidity was too much for an entree.

A good intermezzo of apple and yuzu sorbet with Dungeness crab came next.  Chicken followed and it was served on warm greens with pistachio.  I do not often see chicken on fine dining menus, but I was glad to see it because chicken can be really good if a crispy skin is achieved and the meat is juicy.  The meat was fairly juicy here, but there was no crispy skin.  The greens were okay, but this course felt overseasoned.

Wagyu beef was the final savory course.  It was served over warm sweet and sour red cabbage slaw.  The Wagyu had a fair amount of richness.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked.  It was also more like tri-tip than a true steak so it was slightly tough and chewy.

Dessert consisted of a series of mini desserts, which I felt overall were too fruit focused as well as too tart.  The first dessert was really good strawberries with cream and a nice strawberry sorbet.  The pistachio and cucumber parfait was refreshing and had great creaminess, but there were too many leafy greens, which resulted in a salad-like flavor and texture.  There was also a shortbread cookie with blackberries.  The chocolate part of the dessert had rich chocolate ice cream as well as light meringues and a fruit paste.

Service was excellent--very polished and personable.  I thought my server Breanne was really good and the male server assisting her delivered food presentations with professionalism and knowledge but also an enthusiasm that really makes you want to dive into the food.

Prices were very high, but that is the case with many Vegas restaurants.

Twist provides a good view of The Strip; the dining room is nice, elegant and contemporary.

I am not a fan of Vegas restaurants and there were a few things about Twist that reminded me why I feel this way (the high prices and how Vegas fine dining does not measure up to SF or Chicago).  The food here felt more exciting than Aureole, Guy Savoy and miX though and it is worth a shot if you are looking for high-end but also contemporary French cuisine in Vegas.

CityCenter offers free self parking.

Did you ever say you wished you had a J-Lo butt? Then read on...

I might be a little bias being 1/2 Puerto Rican, but you know you are at the right place when you walk in and see that countries native people eating there. If you want a real treat and have never had Puerto Rican food, please go to Millie's and try it.
It is a Mom & Pop place for sure -you will see Millie herself right behind the counter cookin' your food like you were sitting in her kitchen while her husband is taking your order. The price is definitely right! We practically had the entire menu for $40. Don't be fooled by the ambiance... tiny dining room, fold out tables & chairs, plastic ware & cups with ice from an ice chest propped up on a stool. The food is where the money is!! BTW- cash only, so be prepared. Open Thurs-Sun for lunch & dinner (11am-8pm).

Here are some highlights if you're not familiar:
Tostones... fried & salted plantains - get the garlic side dip
Pasteles... pork inside green banana (like a tamale, but better)
Amarillos... sweet fried banana
Arroz con Gandules... yellow rice w/beans
and last but NOT least (here's where the J-Lo butt comes in)
Mofongo w/a side of pork - it is hard to describe but easy to remember! It is plantain w/crispy fried pork formed into a ball of joy! And the sides of pork that they give are the most tender juicy pork I've ever had. This is a must try item! But not for the faint of heart - literally. 

"Bottom" line is I would eat here everyday if I could afford new clothes.

P.S. I read someone else's review that stated that the Flan was not made there. Just FYI, Millie is the Flan Lady & makes the flan right there in that same kitchen. The only problem is that she makes it for restaurants valley wide & so in that mass production - it loses some of it's homemade quality. It is still good though & she makes a mean pastry. Try 'em!

Worst Chinese food I have ever had by a Chinese owned and run restaurant EVER.  What the hell were their mothers cooking for them when they were kids to think this was passable?     

Jenny, Chad, Debra...you're all right.  It was my fault for not looking at any of the reviews until I checked in after picking up my order.  I actually considered bringing this whole bag back for a refund without trying any of it.  

Then the Yelper denial kicked in.  I thought "Well...Jenny's review was a few months ago and I ordered different stuff so maybe it will be better.".  Everyone is Chinese here so how bad can it be??  OH BABY IT'S BAD!!! 

Their "family dinner" special looked so enticing.  You get 2 entrees with soup, pork fried rice, 2 egg rolls and crab rangoon for $24.99.  That usually means leftovers but it actually meant straight to the garbage can in reality.

Hot and sour soup:  I'll give them credit for soup being hot.  1 out of 2!  Nice job.  I am not sure how they managed to make the soup bland and very oily but they did.  

Chicken and broccoli: The quality of the chicken was rubbery.  My chihuahuas enjoyed it and gave it 3 out of 5 Yelp stars.  

Shrimp and garlic sauce:  When was the last time garlic sauce was red and uber-sweet?  Eff you, chef.  

Pork fried rice:  The best of the worst and it still lacked a lot of flavor.  

I was in such disbelief that I actually called them to let them know how bad it all was.  The person I spoke with said they'd save my phone number and I'd get a free entree the next time I order.  HA!  Maybe if I were contemplating suicide!

I would advise all of the reviewers that bestowed 5 Yelp stars to Cheng's Express to avoid Chinese restaurants like KJ's, HK Star and Wendy's Noodle unless you've consulted a neurosurgeon first because your brain would EXPLODE if you ate at any of those spots.

Not all that long ago this restaurant used to be called Hot Feel, but it shuttered its doors after not even a year in business serving delicious lamb skewers and spicy boiled crawfish.  So when I heard my friend said that there is a new restaurant there with a logo of a lady as part of the signage, my first thought was that it could be China Mama's second location.  But obviously that's not the correct guess.  

Liang's Kitchen  (literal translation is Liang Mama's House), with the logo of the founder/matriarch of the restaurant incorporated into the signage (now in her 80s), is a Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain from California and New York.  With locations in many of the Cali cities that I have previously lived or worked at before my move to Sin City.  So it was a surprise and reality check to see some of the cities listed (Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas).  But I have been out here a relatively long time and those locations could have opened after I had already settled here.

The interior of this Liang's Kitchen still retained the majority of the interior design concepts custom built for the previous restaurant entity. albeit with small but noticeable additions.  The inclusion and prominent display of vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets (very very cool and most people will likely not know anything about its history) high up on the wall with lighting to draw the attention of anyone bothering to quickly survey the restaurant.  Plus there are WWII and Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung from the ceiling in sortie formation (neato!).  

* 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine Corps. (Copy & Paste excerpt from Wiki)  

The menu is extensive and following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices, especially from abroad, looks like a sales catalog with professionally shoot images of some of the menu items, with alternating pages of straight up advertising.  It looks good, but it also has one very annoying attribute or lack thereof, which is the absence of any menu prices.  [Insert comment about if you have to ask about the price, you can't afford it. -Smirk face-]  I know from the restauranteur's perspective it makes sense and saves money in the long run, since they don't have to reprint the menu or have those tacky stickers every time there is a revision to menu pricing.  There is a separate menu sheet that does have the menu items and pricing, but no pictures.  So if you have the patience for it, you can practice cross referencing the main menu with the supplemental menu and other printouts.  Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy!

Food wise, I really liked the Beef and Tendon Soup Noodle that I ordered.  It is definitely ranked in the top two on my list for this item in Las Vegas.  The noodles are the thick chewy handmade variety from Northern China. The beef tendon was cooked long enough so that it is soft and very enjoyable to eat.  The broth is flavorful without being greasy.  The Lamb skewers was good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Their lunch box items has a good variety of pickled vegetables and 1 entire soy sauced egg along with rice and whatever protein you selected (I ordered the Taiwanese fried port cutlet for my friend, she ate everything and liked it except for the pork - too greasy).

Service was good.  However, being a new restaurant with new staff, they are still not completely familiar with the pages and pages of menu items.  But as far as refilling drinks, being friendly, it was good.

I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu.  However, considering the dreary weather, I may not get past their noodles section until late February.

4 stars! And best of luck to the latest Taiwanese restaurant to open in Las Vegas.

Despite being a bit of a sword fight (with a guy to girl ratio of about 5 to 1), XS was still a great club. It helped that I was with my wife and didn't have to compete with the testosterone throngs thrusting against brave ladies that venture onto the dance floor. The entrance fee on Monday night was cheap for XS standards at $30 for dudes and $20 for girls. But, we noticed that most single girls just got in for free if they looked hot with skimpy outfits. Olivia was jealous until I pointed out she was getting in for free (since I was paying ... ).

Once inside, XS was smaller than expected, but it still works. One major positive was the ultra clean bathrooms. The dance floor heated up about 15 minutes after we got there and we staked out a spot in the middle near the front. Morgan Page took over as DJ around 1:30 a.m. and then it became so packed you could literally not move to the beat without bumping others. Eventually you just kind of get used to the close quarters and people touching you on all sides. Hopefully, you'll know one or two of them.

If you don't get a table, there's no place to really relax except outside by the pool or squeezing in with another group. Because of the sausage-fest, ladies should have no problems making several friends. The bartenders were fast and made decent drinks. They ain't cheap, but you didn't go to XS to save money, right.

XS lived up to expectations and was a great way to dance off the Vegas buffet till the morning.

Hawaii in Las Vegas, Aloha!!

One of my yelp friend (Sandra S) raved about this place on her last visit to sin city. I love Hawaiian food so I bookmarked it knowing I was going in December. Fast forward a few months and I'm in Hawaiian Heaven. 

Here's the run down:
Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - a good starter. It was fried perfectly and the mac n cheese was so creamy inside. It was cheap too. $2.45 for 4 big pieces. Delicious 

We came here for the Poke, we got:
Shoyu Ahi poke - my favorite, Delicious. 
Ahi Furukake poke - it was still a bit frozen, but still good. 
Spicy Ahi Combo w/ Crabs, Avocados & Cucumber - my favorite 1A. Delicious
Tako poke w/ Limu (seaweed) - octopus was super tender. 
 The Ahi's were big chunks of raw tuna. So fresh, so good. You've got to try this place if you like poke. 

We also got some hot dishes.
Loco Moco - we were all loco for this dish. The best loco moco I've ever had. The hamburger was just so flavorful and you get two big hand made patties. The gravy is just money. With two eggs & two scoops of rice. Oh man, this alone made the trip here so worth it. Delicious. Must order here. 

Kalua Pig & Cabbage - another winner. Authentic Hawaiian dish. No fake smoke, tender, juicy goodness. Yum yum yum. 

Kalbi - Delicious, fall off the bone tender and  the marinade was spot on. Cooked to perfection. Delicious. 

Hilo Bay Bento Special - this had everything. A piece of spam, pork cutlet, pork teriyaki, beef short rib, noodles, pickled radish and all on a bed of rice. This dish is a mouthful and everything was so so good. It's a special, so they might not have it everyday, but if they do, get it. You won't regret it. 

The service was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a lot of  food and kept adding to the order and the guy taking the order was very patient with us. 

The place is small. A few tables (for 2 only) line the wall. Get your food to go. 

I need a nap now after that luau we just had. 
Hawaiian food done right. 

Sandra, thank you for the recommendation!!

I'll definitely be back

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

You know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. Well, on my recent trip to the USA, I had Yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!

Vegas Elite Dennis T was my lunch companion when I was in town. Not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but I was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review

Dennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.

I had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico

I instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order

The restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.

I had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well

Dennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad

It may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.

Dennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.

In an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this

Dennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the Strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights

A friendship sealed. A celebrity chef ticked off. Lobster sliders consumed. A most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!

Best of 2007: Best Downtown Lunch 
Best of 2006: Best Gourmet Pizza 
Best of 2005: Best Gourmet Pizza 

These are just some of the awards that Cibo has won.
Well, this year, Cibo is being awarded its most prestigious award to date. 
And that is the Craig R's Favorite Dinner While Visiting Arizona Award 

Cibo, which is located in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, is actually an old restored 1913 bungalow. The inside of Cibo has hardwood floors, beautiful stained glass paneling, an all wood bar and a fireplace. Since it was such a warm, beautiful Phoenix evening, my fianc and I decided to dine in the front yard of Cibo, which is covered with tables, Christmas lights and a fire pit. Cibo also has local Jazz bands come in and play live music in the front yard, which gives Cibo a super relaxing and romantic vibe. In fact, this was one of the most romantic evenings my fianc and I have shared in a long time. 

To start out the night we shared their famous Burrata appetizer, which tends to sell out every night. The Burrata consisted of fresh mozzarella topped with a balsamic glaze, black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. This app was extremely flavorful and fun to eat. I can see why it sells out almost every night. The mozzarella was really creamy and had an awesome sweet and tangy flavor because of the balsamic glaze. When you combine all the elements of this dish together you get this awesome little sandwich that is sweet, tangy and salty all at the same time.  

Cibo is known for their homemade wood fire pizza's that they prepare with only locally grown organic produce and imported Italian products. Every pizza on their menu sounded amazing so my fianc and I each ordered a different one so we could share them. These are the pizza's we got: 

Diavola- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, and Italian sausage 
Tartufata- Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and truffle oil. I also added Italian sausage and ricotta cheese.  

Both of these pizzas were phenomenal. They were both huge and cooked perfectly so the crust was thin and crispy, with slightly burnt edges. The spicy salami on the Diavola was actually really, really spicy. The tomato sauce on this pie was extremely flavorful too. The Tartufata  was really cheesy since it contained both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The truffle oil and the white mushrooms that were on this pizza gave it such an amazing taste. 

The service at Cibo was top notch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Since we had never been there before she was very helpful in explaining their menu and giving us suggestions on what we should try and what some of their most popular dishes are. She also always made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed. 
The prices at Cibo were good too. Their pizzas range anywhere from $12 to $15 dollars a piece, which is great considering how big and delicious they were. 

Whether you live in Phoenix or just visiting like I was, if you're looking for a romantic place to take you significant other then look no further than Cibo.

So, you want to know what Old Town is like? Just don't judge, it's freakin' awesome.  

Where else can you meander around charming art galleries (I recommend the Lisa Sette Gallery) and see a drunk man relieve himself behind dumpsters in the same night (I recommend parking your car in a private lot within walking distance of American Junkie, Drift and Dirty Pretty)? You can go from class to trash and back again.  

To illustrate this further, let me give you a run down of a typical Scottsdale night.  Remember, I said no judging!

There are a million places to start off the night with drinks and appetizers. I won't tell you where I go, because I don't want to see you there. After a good buzz develops and I've had something to eat, so I can pace myself for the evening ahead, I'll choose from a plethora of activities depending on the night. If it's Thursday, I might decide to just walk around since all the art galleries are open. On the weekends, I'll probably dance to a live band or laugh at people trying to work it on a stripper pole at Dirty Pretty. If I'm not in the mood to rub up against sweaty bodies, I'll embarrass myself at a karaoke bar. My favorite karaoke song happens to be I touch Myself, but only because it's easy to sing.  See, Scottsdale has variety.  

Later in the night, I may work my way back to more relaxed hangouts where I can actually have a conversation. I will usually continue to drink, so I'm not saying the conversation is good. After I've worked up a drunk fueled craving for food, my friends and I head to Philly Sandwich Co. I've already yelped about how I love watching drunk people eat subs to loud urban music, but eating isn't the only way to cap off the night and I try to not give into drunk cravings too often. So what is a girl to do? How about a trip to Zorba's? You should ask for a tour. 

So that's Scottsdale. A little bit of culture and a lot of debauchery. Have fun. And, if debauchery isn't your thing, after perusing the art galleries you can always settle for the best milkshake of your life at the Sugar Bowl.

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the "3 Tacos" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a "Pulehu Steak Burrito" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of "Coconut Bark" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! 

You can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru.

Stefano Fabbri, owner of Pomo Pizzeria, is not only passionate about his food, but he has a contagious enthusiasm that's informative and downright convincing.

The Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana at the Borgota in Scottsdale is a sleek and beautiful space. The dining room has soaring ceilings, dark furniture and a mural showing someone riding a scooter in the streets of Italy. It appears to be another trendy, albeit sexy, pizzeria, but it's actually more than that.

Pomo recently earned a certification from the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, meaning that everything from the flour, olive oil, kneading and baking meets exacting standards. This is a pretty big deal considering there are only a few dozen restaurants in the country that have this certification. But the staff doesn't let the honor go to their heads; service is friendly and attentive.

Pizza is the name of the game here, and seeing it prepared is a blast. In the open part of the kitchen you'll see a classic red Berkel meat slicer used to prepare the selection of cured meats. This is one serious meat slicer that I can only dream of having in my own kitchen. To see it in action I ordered the Affettati Misti ($14.95), a plate filled with the chef's choice of paper-thin slices of bresaola, prosciutto, salami, olives and cheese.

At lunchtime, Pomo serves a handful of Paninis, but these are not the typical grilled sandwiches. They quick bake fresh dough in a blistering hot oven that yields a slightly charred, yet light and crispy bread. Then they stuff it full of Italian goodness, like the Salami Panini ($9.95), which was filled with spicy salami, arugula and mozzarella cheese. Served with a simple side salad, the panini was excellent and satisfying.

Like the panini, pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 900 degrees. This means that a pizza takes only about a minute and a half to cook. By Naples standards, the pizzas are decidedly thin though surprisingly the crust isn't ultra crispy as one might expect. Instead the crust is light and moist with an excellent toothsome chew.

Fabbri recommended starting with the basics, and since he'd know best, ordering the Regina Margherita ($11.95) was on point. The tomato sauce was bright and sweet, then the flavor of the milky fresh mozzarella kicked in which was enhanced by fresh chopped basil.

Another way to enjoy the stupendous crust was the Calzone Napoletano ($14.95), which is not your run of the mill calzone. It was filled with spicy salami, tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. Each creamy bite deserved another, as I wickedly ate the whole thing.

What better way to end than to order dessert? While they do have standards like Tiramisu ($7.95) and Panno Cotta ($7.95), the light and airy Semifreddo Di Mandorle ($7.95) was a standout. Each bite of the partially frozen mousse was accented with a toasted pistachio crust. More please.

With a passion for tradition, this might be as close to an authentic Italian pizza as you'll get without going to Italy.

***This was my first ever trip to an aquarium and I found Shark Reef's Aquarium to be really enjoyable given their good sampling of ocean life (starfish, jellyfish, sharks, piranhas, sea turtles, octopus, stingrays, and more); if you have more experience with aquariums though, you may walk away disappointed with this one given the high admission price ($18 for adults)***

I have never stayed at the Mandalay Bay, but I have been inside the resort many times to dine at their restaurants (Burger Bar, RM Seafood, Aureole, Fleur, House of Blues), attend events in their convention center and stroll through Mandalay Place.  Despite all these visits, I have never been to their Shark Reef Aquarium, which is probably because it is so tucked away--over by the convention center on a side far from their main parking structure.

Mandalay Bay's Shark Reef Aquarium has advertisements that boasts it is North America's only aquarium dedicated to predators.  I am not sure if that is true, but given that I have never been to an aquarium, I felt this attraction was well worthwhile.

Besides the sharks, there were lots of great ocean life here.  I thought easily the most impressive was the jellyfish.  The tanks allow you to get really up close and personal and you get to see the beautiful colors, lighting and movement of this species.  It was really a sight to see and just by looking at the jellyfish, I can tell many science fiction movies have been inspired by jellyfish in their attempt to depict alien life.

The Komodo dragon, while incredibly still, was also impressive looking.  There were several interesting fish to view--from a very large and rare version of a catfish to the more well known piranhas.  Giant sea turtles were also on display as well as stingrays.  You are allowed to touch some of the stingrays, which is a rarity at this aquarium; there were very little interactive exhibits--the attraction mostly features ocean life behind thick glass and posted signs providing quick yet interesting facts.

In terms of the sharks, they were fun to see.  They have an okay variety and some were super quick and hard to photograph while others seemed to be deliberately slower and thus more menacing.  The sharks felt small though; if you have seen the footage of the shark recently captured on film at Manhattan Beach, the sizes of the sharks here may feel slightly underwhelming.

The aquarium has a good number of exhibits.  It is a self-guided tour and it will take you anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on how interested you are in reading the information displays.

Service was fine.  There were only a few polite staff members throughout the aquarium since it is mostly a look and see attraction.

Prices are high.  For adults, it is $18 to walk through the aquarium.  For me, the price was fine because I have not been to any other aquariums, but customers with more experience with aquariums may walk away feeling this attraction is a bad value.

Mandalay Bay's Shark Reef Aquarium is a great option if you are not that familiar with aquariums and ocean life and want to get away from the shows, casino, food, and clubs that dominate The Strip.  It is also a very family friendly entertainment option with a family friendly gift shop.  You can also book the aquarium's private room for events and such like a child's birthday.

Mandalay Bay, like other casinos on The Strip, has free self parking.  It is typically very easy finding an open space.

I heard so much about this place that after dinner at Japanese Curry Zen in the same strip mall (Seoul Plaza), we stopped by Sweets Raku.  SR is located West of the 15 on Spring Mountain Rd.

As the name indicates, SR specializes in desserts.  However, they do have savory items on the menu like foie gras torchon ($18) & caviar ($30).  We shared the three course Prix Fixe that comes w/ an amuse (mango gelato), your choice of one of the desserts of the day:  We chose the baton (chocolate rolled dough) filled w/ pistachio & chocolate mousse, and a cream puff filled w/ chocolate cream.  The price is normally $17, but because we shared it was $24 (O_o).  In addition, we ordered 5 macarons for $9 to go.  The meal starts whimsically, because the menu is edible and they give you a raspberry sauce to dip it in.  Unfortunately, the menu reminded me of a communion wafer, and was apros pos for the remainder of the prix fixe.

The amuse tasted good:  The mango flavor really stood out.  But it wasn't worth the average of $8 for the 3 course prix fixe:  2 Stars.  On the other hand, the second course tasted very good (especially the baton).  The baton had several layers and the fillings were very flavorful:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the third course was pretty bad.  There wasn't much too it, and the portion was tiny for the $8 average price:  2 Stars.

BTW, we tried the macarons the next day, and they were OK.  They were not as good as Bottega Louie's, and definitely not better than Bouchon's:  3 Stars.

Our waitress Yuta was super nice.  However, the courses came out very slowly.  Additionally, we noticed several guests were turned away because of a wait vs putting them on a waiting list and asking them to return:  3 Stars.  The ambiance is pretty cool.  There is an interesting spoon out front, there are tins of tea on the wall, and wine bottles in a dope display case.  However, this place is very cramped.  Its best to sit at the bar to see your creations being made:  3 Stars.

IMHO, this place is overhyped and appeals primarily to females - Including my yf Dani S.  But she didn't notice me cos she was on a date.  In any case, my date looked better than her, so Dani would have been mad!  - LOL!!!  In reality, there was only two guys on a Sat nite, and the place was packed).  Nonetheless, I won't be coming back.  I am not sure what raku means, but they are running a "rakut" here w/ the high prices for mediocre food.  I would have rated this place Two Stars if the service wasn't good.

Ah, the 'Spike!  I heard they slapped some lipstick on your piglike face and made you a little better.  Though I have a few months to know, I have to admit...  I have a feeling you'll always be the same vile, familiar whore to me.  And that familiarity could never breed contempt.

Here's my flea-bitten memories and my tribute to the old gal, for what they'e worth... there is a sparse, trash-strewn parkinglot that greets you and your vehicle on the get-go.  You walk into the casino and are swooning with all the scents of smoke, stale piss, and heady aroma of human excess.  The sights are nothing to shake a stick at, either.... LOTS of garish lights!!!   Zoom to the bar, see a bunch of greasy heads swaying over their beers.  I knew I was gonna love this place.

Checking in with my buddy was like a trip to the DMV, and grinded a halt to the easy, free feeling I got when I walked in here.  We booked a "suite" for $50 on a weekend, and felt that our called-in reservation should have sufficed.  The surly receptionist heaved and grunted as she looked through the phone call records of our reservation--apparently, it was lost.  But when it was found... I knew our trip had only just begun.

The "suite" was like looking into a tidy motel room you'd pretty much find anywhere on the side of some desert road.  A reasonably cleaned carpet... with a crisp, normal scent hanging in the air.  I pulled back the fitted sheet of our bed-- NO bed bugs, NO blood residue.  I was a little taken aback, until I went into the bathroom and saw the biohazard sharps container.  A placard on the mirror proudly chirped "FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, IF YOU ARE SELF-MEDICATING".  I figured this was a perk of booking a suite.

We heard no screams or loud noises, or cracked-out diatribes from the rooms around us, just a roomfull of guys across the way playing chess with their door open.  Not bad! 

On our way to Freemont Street, a talkative and protective security guard walked me and my friend across the street to assure our safety.  How's that for going the extra mile, huh?!!!  I kept assuring him he didn't have to, but he insisted.  

After a reckless night out, the details of which would be distracting from all this, we found ourselves back at our hotel... hungry and wanting some more booze.  $2.50 grilled cheese sandwiches and fries in the diner.  I was happy as a sick dog in a landfill.

The bar was somewhat packed at this hour--a good sign.  Schlitz on tap!  I can't even remember how cheap the beer was, but it was flowing like crazy.  I bought a pitcher for the lady of the night sitting next to us in her skirt made of shredded pantyhose.  

There is so much to be seen if you stay here... no matter how renovated this place may be, I just know there is a value of good times at reasonable prices, with no-nonsense staples that are there for you in a heartbeat in a Vegas full of pretense and designer nightclubs and plastery cheapness.  I am a simple woman, I like my blowsy good times REAL and showy and blatant-- and I just can't wait to see how the Spike can contribute to more, and how she's changed up since then!!!!

Yay! I can't take the grin off my face after visiting UNION and discovering the perfect "union" of incredible local businesses in the Valley. This reminds me of the Arizona version of the Ferry Building in San Francisco. The feel of UNION is organic, local, boutique-y and simply delightful! It's the type of place that you can stop by on a lazy afternoon and get lost in exploration of each of the 18 businesses housed within the same building. But allow me to walk you through it in a bit more depth! 

Upon entering the south-side of the Biltmore Fashion Park, you see a welcoming patio with tables, chairs and umbrellas that offer the perfect spot for a snack, meal or to work. A coffee shop window space allows you to grab a beverage without actually entering UNION, but do yourself a favor and step through the doors. Within UNION, Trattoria del Piero serves an abundance of fresh and organic food options, including salads and tasty-looking sandwiches. I made the mistake of eating before I visited, but I won't do that again! UNION is a long hallway of 18 boutiques on either side. It's airy, open and friendly. This is a local shopper's paradise because it's a one-stop-shop for practically everything. 

Here's a list of just some of the adorable shops within UNION:

- An organic gift shop with accessories for the kitchen and house. 
- Whoopie Pie bakery with whoopies of every kind 
- Queen Creek Olive Oil Company with olive oils, wine, accessories and body products 
- Frances, complete with clothing, jewelry and gifts 
- Smeeks - the ultimate candy store that's the perfect place to satisfy the sweet tooth or pick up a present. 
- Citrine - one of my favorite stores in UNION and owned by a very nice woman named Melissa who has a detailed knowledge of skincare. This shop has moisturizers, face products and makeup. They even make their own perfume for you!
- A bicycle shop...yes a bicycle shop! 
- A flower shop with fresh and beautiful flowers 
- A news-stand 
- A men's clothing store 

*** I know I'm missing several of the shops, but hopefully this gives you an idea of the variety within UNION! 

Whether you have $1, $5 or $100 to spend, the thing I like about UNION the most is that it doesn't really matter how much money you have to spend because it's enjoyable just merely looking around. However, with the the amount of adorable merchandise surrounding you, it will be hard to leave empty-handed! I plan on spending many a lazy afternoon here moving forward!

Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.

Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q 

Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.  

We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:

- Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g 
 
- Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g 

- Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w 

The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)

Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the dcor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ
 
Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.

I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?

This is my new go-to place for bubble tea. I think that the value for the price and quality is better than most places here in Vegas. I've been here a few times and while it hasn't been consistent most of the time, this is the place where I would frequently visit for my boba needs.

It's a fairly new spot that's been open for a few months. I've gotten turned in this place by the recommendation of some yelper buddies. It's located on spring mountain next to lees sandwiches.

Popcorn chicken - a Taiwanese speciality, the one at fat dumpling is nice and crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy in the center with an interesting seasoning. They give you an OK amount for the price, but I think they should give more.

Smoothies - order the jumbo size. It's the best deal in town. It's the Big Gulp of bubble teas. All of the fruit they use are real. The tea also has good flavor as well. I've never found boba quality as high as Half & Half tea house in LA, but... It's good here. Sometimes a lil bit too soft, but better than a lot of places in Vegas. My total for a jumbo smoothie with boba was 5.14, not too sha-bay!

What's also great is that they are open later than most places. While most of them close between 8:30 to 10pm on the weekdays, this place closes at midnight. The same time the werewolves come out...

First night of the 4 day trip we end up here after discussing Steak and Tits, not a bad combo right? Please read.

$25 Cab ride
Damn this place is far. We get out of the cab and this place looks cool. Okay fine, we go in cause there's nothing else around and the cab took off already.

$30 Cover charge
Umm okay...so I guess it's Tit's THEN steak? I guess. After paying cover we're escorted into the empty Restaurant portion of the joint...um what? The "waitress" tells us not to worry, she'll have a few girls come over and give us some attention. We tell her not to worry cause we're hungry for Steak more than Tits at this point. So she laughs and gets our drink orders....5 minutes go by..10...I'm gonnd look at boobies..15 minutes..WTF did she go to Ireland for my Guinness? Oh there she is! 

She takes our food order...all menu items are ala carte...we all ordered steaks and there was no choice as to the size of the portion we ordered but they were all HUGE the filet mignon being the smallest 18oz!!!! But that shit cost $62!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!!!!!?!!!!! I got a 24oz $48 Rib Eye and the "Waitress" says the portions of sides are pretty big and 1 order should be fine for us all. So we just got:$15 Mashed Potatoes and
$15 Sauteed mushrooms....hopefully it's a huge portion of sides. Plus 2x $12 Guinness. 

So with our orders placed after about 5 minutes the "waitress" brings out some cold bread and butter...our 2nd round of drinks arrives about 10 minutes after we'd ordered them...keep in mind the Food part of this place is empty...We dig into the bread cause we're hungry as hell....

10 minutes later the beer shows up. 
We check out boobs...
5 more minutes...Oooh look that one has got cellulite!....
+10 minutes....*watches old man dry sexin a stripper doggy style*....friend says,"I smell fish or...is that blood?" Back to the table we go.
+20 sitting at table talkin....coulda did this at the room...minus the fishy/blood aroma where we walked by.

"Didn't the "Waitress" say she was going to send some entertainment over to our table?"
"Yeah." 
"Uhh k?"

+5 Food comes "HOLY SHIT!!!" Huge meat is placed in front of each of us who had ordered. It was good too....wait..."who ordered the baby shoe sized portion of potatoes and shrooms???" Fuck it...we eat.

Minutes later, we're all so stuffed we can't walk. The majority of us at the table are straight up carnivores that destroy buffets But damn. This amount of food, so late at night which is placed atop several pints of beer, shots of liquor and who knows what else, isn't good at a strip joint.

We finished eating, pay $685 for 6...yes...$685 for 6...so dumb. Then we go and sit in a corner to chill. After a while a girl comes over and sits on my in process 24oz steak....

"I'm sorry, but no...please. Get off."
"What are you broke?"
"No I'm FULL." 

This happened to a couple more of us and we leave. When Steak ruins tits it's never a good thing. Treasures needs to balance their portions...I'll let you decide on what to make smaller your women or your steak, I like my girls with meat...so yeah please take the hint.

I stopped by with my friend on Fri. night for dinner before seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum.  Between the convenient location in the Cultural District, the good reviews from other Yelpers, and the reasonable prices, this place seemed like a potential winner.  Unfortunately, however, the food and atmosphere left something to be desired.

The a la carte dinner menu is pretty extensive, and includes most of the usual dishes offered at Indian restaurants.  Because I'd tried samples of chicken makhni (butter chicken) from friends at another Indian restaurant in Oakland and really liked it, but had never ordered it myself before, I decided to order it.  Bad move!  The sauce was less creamy than that served with the dish at the other restaurant (see photo), and the chicken was of poor quality--all dark meat, with several pieces of gristle that I had to pull out of my mouth while eating (as discreetly as possible, of course, to avoid grossing out my friend).  This version of the dish was disappointing, to the point that I only ate a bit more than half of it before abandoning the rest.

In addition to my entree, I ordered a mango lassi, as I usually do at Indian restaurants.  Even this was a disappointment, given its thinness in comparison to versions I've had at other Indian restaurants around town.

My friend ordered the malai kofta, a vegetarian dish consisting of potato balls stuffed with paneer and vegetables in a light cream sauce with nuts and raisins.  She let me try a bite or two, and it tasted much better than my chicken makhni.  If I'd ordered this dish, I probably would have finished it and left with a much better assessment of the food than I did.  Indeed, my friend did so, and expressed satisfaction with its quality.

Aside from the quality of the food, I was rather unimpressed with the ambiance, which I'd describe as a notch below no frills.  There was no music, the wall decorations were pretty sparse, and the tables were unadorned except for menus under the glass tops.  Moreover, the place had a slight aura of griminess that was apparent from the odd odor that I encountered upon entering.  Service was okay, and the food came was served in a reasonable timeframe, so I have no major complaints there.

Overall, I've had better Indian food in superior settings at other places around town, so I probably won't return.  It seems as though most people come here for the lunch buffet, so it's possible that the quality is better than their a la carte cooking.  If you do order a la carte, I'd recommend sticking to the chef's specialties (the malai kofta was one of them), and avoiding the chicken makhni, for sure.  If I went solely by my own experience, my rating would be a 2, but my friend seemed pretty pleased, so I'm averaging to a 3 to better reflect our combined judgment.

I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)

Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)

During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)

God help, me...I still love them so:)

I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)

There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)

Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...

That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)

It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)

What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)

They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)

They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)

Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)

Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!

They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)

It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)

Still hung over from a night of drinking we strolled into the Wicked Spoon with one idea in mind, stuffing our faces. I hadn't really slept much and still had a headache but I figured that an all you can eat paradise would get me back on track.  That and maybe a couple more drinks...

Now while waiting in line to gain entry into the promised land, I did what every bored fat kid does when waiting in line at a buffet.  I left my friends to sneak a peak at the goods (and maybe have a taste or two).  Best idea ever!

As I walked around I noticed that they had a dope carving station with my all time favorite item...ding ding ding PORK BELLY, which was resting beside a giant leg of lamb and a perfectly cooked tri-tip. I began to drool...

Honestly at this point I didn't care for much else.  I was planning on eating my weight in pork fat and slabs of rare beef and lab.  I was sold. I then grabbed a few pieces of humbolt fog and headed out to meet my friends and pay.

Once in I b-lined straight to the carving station and filled my plate up like I hadn't eaten in days.  Heck after leaving the carving station I didn't have much room for anything else, which worked out well because I had gotten what I came for. MEAT MEAT and more MEAT!

And we lived happily ever after...

Other notable items were the salads, cheeses, and mini appetizers.  I wasn't a big fan of the pastas, or fish item I tried.  Wood fired pizza was good, and I loved pureed potatoes. The Asian section kinda sucked, but the Asian section at most buffets usually suck so lets call that a wash.  The desserts are kinda wack, minus the gelato and the tiny dessert thing with the mini macaron on top (so cute).

Overall I just wasn't that impressed with anything except the carving station, but like I said above it was love at first bite. In fact I'm still dreaming about that succulent pork belly and perfectly cooked beef.  #beingfatrules

Rubio's gives me hope for fast food. 

Maybe it's the grass roof seating area inside (see photo), but the food is very good and it's not so cookie cutter predictable here. 

We first started coming here after leaving the northwest.  Mostly because it reminded me of another great seafood place: "Taco Del Mar".  I much prefer seafood, while the family enjoys beef and chicken.  The prices here are closer to Chipotle, than Toxic Hell (aka, Taco Bell).

I love their original Fish Taco and it's only $1.49 on Tuesdays after 2:30.  Normally it goes for $2.79, so it's a great deal.  Another favorite is their Veggie Burrito, which is more flavorful than Chipotle and priced at the same $6.49.  But here it's a better deal because they includes chips.  Their large side of beans is also a good deal for only $1.49.  They also have a good selection of beer.

Rubio's is not perfect and sometimes the fish can be dry.  But most of the time, it's really very good.  The folks who work here are also great.  Mark behind the counter particularly makes you feel welcome and is good at sharing stories.  Oscar the Manager keeps the place very clean and the Salsa Bar is always immaculate (see photo).  Another plus!

Here are their posted "Fresh Rule" as you come in:
1) Flavor comes FIRST; 
2) We never start your meal without YOU; 
3) Our chips, salsa and Guacamole are made FRESH; 
4) Our signature black & pinto beans are NEVER refried; 
5) We use NO lard or MSQ ever!

Works for me!

The only weakness, which is really not their fault, is the location. Rubio's is sandwich between an AT&T store and the Skeptical Chymist pub.  It has virtually no parking and because of those other two places the parking lot can be a mess at times.  I find 2:30-3:00 works best for a late lunch.

Three and Half Stars Plus, or "A-OK" bordering on Four.

Enjoy!

Peruvian food in Las Vegas?? Whaaaaa... so good! Fresca in the Bay Area is really hard to top, but this place is a great replacement for SF transplants. The set up is a bit funky - this place used to be some sort of 50's style diner and they have kept the decor, but it looks like they are trying to fix up the back area to be more in line with the style they are going for. They use an iPad as their menu, which is a great way to see pics of their food and get a feel for the portion size. Our waitress was extremely helpful and patient, I highly suggest getting the calamari appetizer and their in-house mayo. I had asked her which of the specialty drinks she preferred (I can't think of the names now, but one was passion fruit flavored and the other one was more cinnamon) and she actually offered samples of the drinks. And there weren't tiny cups, she filled up 1/3 of a regular cup and let us taste it. Both had really distinct and strong flavors that paired well with our meal, so definitely order a specialty drink when you're here. I ended up with the lomo saltado as an entree - I wish the meat was a little bit more tender, but still, good flavors and portions. They also do have an aji de gallina which our waitress said they only have as a breakfast special, so I'll try to come back for that. I'll definitely be back to explore the menu a bit more and order those wonderful drinks.

George & Son's has one of the best Buffets in the Valley!

A group of us came here for the Lunch Buffet last Thursday.  Our merry Yelp'ers included our ring leader Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C, Norm R and Arlin B.  For some reason, I thought the place opened at 11 am (it's 11;30) and arrived early.  On the plus side, it afforded me the opportunity of watching as they setup.  It was impressive.

One of the weaknesses of the buffet concept is the inability of keeping food hot and fresh.  Chinese food, particularly Schezuan which has thicker sauces lends itself well to this steam-warming method.  

WHAT MAKES GEORGE & SON'S SPECIAL? It is their method of preparing and putting out a only small amount of food at one time.  Though they have a setup for eight dishes, which is always in use. They are constantly rotating the food items, as the Cook prepares more.   Look at the photos and you'll see the smaller, more manageable size.  Given the nearly dozen or so dinners, in addition to our group, nothing was left for very long anyway.

I started with the tossed salad, with a light ranch dressing.  Next, I tried the Tofu Vegetable Soup(photo) which was outstanding and delicious.  The flavor was subtle and I left wanting to order some for later.  

Next to the buffet, they had some deep fried onion rings, mushroom, and other veggies in a beer, rather than tempura batter. It too had a nice flavor.

As for the entrees, I found the Sauteed Shrimp and Onions(photo), and the Honey Chicken(photo) that stuck to the top of my mouth the best. As you took the Honey Chicken, you could see the silk thread like strands of honey attached to the serving tongs.  You cannot get anything fresher than that!  But, everything they made was very good.

The bill came to $9.75 before tip, but including taxes.  As I mentioned in my Yelp Tip, if you come here and check-in, you will get 15% off your next meal.  A nice incentive.  

The restaurant came close to Five Stars.  But in the end, I felt the Four Star, "Yay! I'm a fan" was more on the mark.  Keep in mind, the Lunch Buffet starts at 11:30, Monday through Friday!

Enjoy!

Dr. Susan Boyd almost cost me my life... 

She performed, well attempted to perform a normally simple laproscopy procedure going through my belly button to remove a cyst from my left ovary. 

This procedure she performed in a surgical clinic by her office near UMC. 

I was sent home about one hour after the procedure once my anesthesia wore off. 

I was home for two hours resting and I started feeling faint and my lips and face were turning blue. I felt like death, I knew something was wrong because my body was shutting down and I was slowly losing consciousness. 

My husband at the time called an ambulance and they rushed me to Spring Valley hospital where I passed out upon arrival. 

I don't remember anything other than waking up connected to lots of tubes, IV, and various life support machines. 

Come to find out I was bleeding internally and my organs shut down. 

Emergency surgery was done, following two blood transfusions. 

Rather than her performing the simple laporoscopy going in through my belly button and lasering away the cyst, she missed that completely and punctured my small intestines causing me to bleed internally. 

She did not remove the cyst, that I still have on my left ovary, in which she even goofed on the paperwork stating she removed a cyst from my right ovary which there is none. 

That is the irony of this, I went through hell in vain as the cyst is still there and was never removed. 

I ended up in surgical ICU for three weeks at Spring Valley hospital where I underwent a bowel resection to remove six inches of my small intestines she punctured through and damaged. 

I went through hell to say the least. I am LUCKY to be alive. This woman almost took my life. 

Thank you Spring Valley hospital and the two Doctor's called in as an emergency from other hospital's to save me. I was in such grave condition they did not have a Doctor on staff who knew what to do, or who could handle my emergency situation, so they called out for help from two hospitals in the east side of vegas. 

Her office placed a follow up call to my hubby and was aware I had been admitted to the hospital two hours after my procedure, not once did her staff nor her contact me or the hospital to inquire about my condition. 

They were rather nasty when my hubby went to pick up all of my medical records. They made him come back so that they could review them and make changes to them. That is not what they said but what they did. Dr. Susan Boyd attempted to cover up her mistake and by doing so she screwed up the documents all together. I was treated for a cyst on my left ovary, all of a sudden she states removed from right ovary which there was none? 

Yes Malpractice you say? It was however I signed my life away to allow a "simple" laproscopy procedure to be performed not knowing I was going to have my vital organs butchered. 

It took two years to recover from this ordeal. I have a real doozy of a scar from my breast bone clear down to my private area where I was split open for correction surgery, not once but twice. Basically ALL of my plumbing was redone. 

I was so close to having to use a colostomy bag the rest of my life. Luckily I had two great Doctor's perform my bowel resection as a team together side by side. 

It is a tragedy that Dr. Susan Boyd got away with this...she knew when she left me at the clinic that she had really botched this procedure. 

I wonder if she knew she perforated my intestines or as the result of it that I was bleeding internally? This I will never know... 

If I could rewind time I would, I can live with a cyst in which I am since she did not remove it. 

Karma is a you know what! 

She will get what is coming to her I am sure. 

She basically almost got away with murder and skipped out on a two hundred thousand dollar hospital bill. Three weeks in surgical ICU to keep me alive was not cheap! 

I am alive, physically and mentally scarred for life... I made it :) 

I am still here to share with the world, my love, laughter and smiles... 

This is just another example and reminder of some of the hell and life threatening close calls I have been through with "Doctor's" based in las vegas. I have only lived in Las Vegas 6 years and have had the worst outcome in dealing with Doctor's here. Yes a bad Doctor can be anywhere, yet I lived in San Diego and Los Angeles for years and had nothing but the best outcome and care from Doctor's and providers. Take warning if you have to have any medical procedure's done in Las Vegas.

I was 32 when this happened a few years back, I am alive because I was a fighter and was not ready to call it quits on life at such a young age. Especially not for the incompetence or at the hands of a Doctor who we are to trust with our lives!

I have been hearing about this place for a long time. The problem with this "impulse" visit since we were in Town Square was not reading the Yelp reviews beforehand. They seemed to range from 1 star...those who came for the food to 4/5 stars...those interested in the alcohol.
This spot (which used to be the Meatball Spot and prior hookah lounge) has been plagued with restaurant failures. I was hoping that a known strip brand would finally break that cycle, but it sadly did not. 
My daughter pointed out that most of the wait staff are "good looking", which seems to trump decent service. Albeit a very nice staff, no one seemed to have any real service industry substance. I asked our server about menu items and popularity and got a generic response. My order came out wrong the first time and small things like a side of ranch dressing with our fries were quickly forgotten items.
I ordered what was the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a long time. The chicken caesar crepe looked promising but left me feeling nauseous, even as I write this review. It is presented as a crepe filled with a thick alfredo-like sauce with pieces of chicken served alongside a creamy caesar salad...with chicken. Why? I don't know. I only took a couple bites and it took every ounce of willpower not to gag.
My daughter and wife both had the buffalo chicken sandwich. My wife enjoyed it, but my daughter said it was too tangy for her taste. An unfortunate dining experience when the best part was the fries.
We saw most of the patrons enjoying a large smoking alcoholic beverage...what this place is known for. It's Sugar should just remove food from their agenda altogether and only serve drinks.
Our bill came to $55 for 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 gross crepe. Sigh, really hate being disappointed in food and ripped off when dining out. I don't like the fact they will be opening up a location at the Galleria Mall because there are so many other worthy establishments. NEXT!!!

Lunch here was unexpectedly good!

I had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!

So after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.

Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.

Blue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  

Smoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.

Grouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.

We passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  

Eyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.
Nose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!
Ear ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!
Mouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!
Tummy ~ Very well satisfied!

"Hello, welcome to our dog and pony show.  We're so happy to have you as clients, and we want to show our appreciation for your business.  But we're too cheap to take you to see a Cirque Du Soleil show, even though there's a good one across the street at the MGM Grand.  So we'll take you to what we think is a hip, hot, happenin' joint:  Hyde!"

At least that's how I interpreted it.

It's an exclusive club, complete with a velvet rope;  they don't let just anybody in, and it looks like you need to have a little dough to get in and imbibe.  Once you're in, it has a high-class feel in its decor, furniture, and view of the fountains.  Pretty good thick pizza and sliders.  And drinks, of course, with more emphasis on the drinks than the food;  I think that if I asked for a Coke, they'd give it to me with rum in it.

Not really my kind of venue.  Our group had the back part reserved for our private party, with a clear view of the fountains dancing around to "In The Mood".  I spent most of my time eating - well, I am on a seefood diet, y'know.  The music was not so loud that we couldn't talk to each other, what a relief.  I was disappointed that no one got up and danced;  I was told that this happened after our party was over, and that it got a little weird.

I guess it's okay if it's your thing.  No complaints about their prices, which I didn't check out;  at least you get something for your money, which you won't in the casinos (remember, the house wins almost all the time).  I won't be back, but that's just me.

Boba!

Yes, I said boba.  Boba as in "a name for the sweet, chewy, tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea/boba tea drink."

There are few places that have boba in the Valley, and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions, I finally decided to go pay them a visit.

I walked in at an odd time... around 5pm on a Tuesday.  I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!

I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to "suck it up" quite literally... and it was delicious!

I took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!  And regardless, go check out Red Kimchi's boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think!

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining.

It may be Tryst or Pure or whatever "Sexy name" club on the strip for you during your Vegas trips, but for for a dive barrin' gal like myself, it's the Double Down. ...well at least it is from now on.

Always expecting dives to be at list a smidge too hot and muggy, I was pleasantly surprised by a blast of cool A/C when I walked in and remembered that A/C is an absolute must everywhere in Vegas - even in dive bars. 

And it is a dive. Through and through and through... although with surprisingly clean floors. In fact, after reading about the Double Down and having knowledge of a drink called "Ass Juice," I was actually surprised at just how clean the Double Down was. DOn't get me wrong, it's not pristine, but they keep it in pretty good shape. Must be due to all that puke insurance they offer.

"Puke insurance?" you ask. Yes, puke insurance. For a mere $20, my friend - if you puke, you are not responsible for cleaning it up. Somehow I don't think this is offered on my AAA policy. 

Now, on to the (in)famous drinks. The Double Down falls under my philosophy of "Just because it's the 'original' doesn't make it the best." And that's sadly how I felt about the "original" bacon martini. It wasn't that bacon-y... but at least it was super vodka-y, so you get your $6 worth. 

The ass juice... well, I was thinking of it wrong. When I hear "ass juice," before you're even finished saying the words, I'm already grossed out. So I was expecting something pickley and briney and gross... turns out it's a girly drink with peach schnapps in it. I've decided that it's gotta be called ass juice, as in "Dude, I'm going to get so much ass with this juice."

Strong drinks, ridiculous names for drinks, puke insurance, semi-surly barkeeps... all things for a strong 4-star dive. What bumps 'em on up to 5? Pinball. Not just any pinball - the Playboy Pinball machine. One of my faves. I was bummed that the flippers didn't quite work all the time, but I'll take what I can get... plus they had a photobooth and pool to add to the mix too.

Next time I've been wiped out at the Blackjack tables in Vegas, you'll know where to find me.

My disgust and hatred for the Venetian is due to the fact that they lost mine and my friend (fellow Yelper) Ingrid R's luggage the same day we arrived in Vegas for a girlfriend's bachelorette weekend.

Yes, you read that right: THE VENETIAN LOST OUR LUGGAGE. 

THE INCIDENT: Sat 6/23/12
11am: We gave 2 pieces of luggage to Jeremy, bellhop.
215pm: We gave our claim ticket to Sean, bellhop, to pick up our bags.
245pm: There was no word from anyone about our luggage nor did we see our bags as other guests' luggage were brought out.
245-4pm: We asked Shahid, the Guest Services manager at the bellhop desk, about our bags. He found our claim ticket in the trash at the bell desk. He took us to the luggage storage areas to locate our bags, but they weren't there.
4pm: Shahid offered us a hospitality suite as a temporary holding place to wait until security met with us to write up a report.
4:30pm: Craig, security, wrote up a report and took an inventory of what was in each luggage. He also made phone calls to lost&found; housekeeping; and the front desk to see if our bags turned up, but no luck. He gave us a card for the Venetian's Claims Dept and told us to call them in 3 days if our bags weren't found.
5:30pm: We called Shahid for an update: still no bags. We asked him what course of action would be taken given the fact that we were now without clothes, toiletries, and other items that had been in our luggage. He said he'd speak to the general manager, Alissa, and get back to us.
5:15pm: Shahid called back and told us we were approved for a comp'd room and would be given $250 each for any purchases needed to get us through the weekend. Shahid told us they'd still search for our bags. He explained that our bags may have been mistakenly sent up to another guest's room but in the back of my mind I had a feeling our bags were given to a guest who was checking out of the Venetian.

The way the Venetian handled the situation was infuriating. Yes we were given a complimentary room (big deal) and $250 each, but that was only because WE asked what the plan of action was after realizing our luggage was lost. There was no sense of urgency in making sure we were taken care of which made us feel as if our situation was not a priority. 

BTW, when Ingrid and I went to pick up our luggage, we had just left Tao Beach. We were only wearing swim attire and luckily had our wallets with us, but we lost everything else: shoes, makeup *$#!@, outfits, toiletries, and my valuable items: my camera, my grandma's vintage Louis Vuitton clutch, and my Kindle.  Yes I'm aware that I shouldn't have left my valuables in my luggage but it seemed safer to leave it in my locked luggage than bring it all with me to Tao Beach. So not only did we lose the items in our luggage, which were of both monetary and sentimental value, but we missed out on some bachelorette activities since we had to go to the mall to buy shoes, clothes, and basic underwear and to Walgreens to buy toiletries that the Venetian didn't offer, while dressed in our bathing suits.

AFTERMATH:
I wrote a letter to Alissa, the general manager, expressing my frustration over the situation. She replied 3 days later apologizing and informing me to contact her should we choose to stay at the Venetian in the future. Really?! Aside from going to the Canyon Ranch Spa, I have no desire to set foot in their hotel. I called their Claims Department, 3 days later, and spoke with Tony who informed me that due to an "Innkeepers Statute" under Nevada Law, the max payout for each of our lost luggage would be $750. Really?!?!?  I was livid. The Venetian is a damn casino raking in millions, if not billions, of dollars and the most they can pay out is $750?!  Freaking ridiculous!!!  What was the point in wasting our time in taking an inventory of our lost items if in the end all we were going to get was $750?!  Tony went on to tell me that they've exhausted all means in locating our luggage and that the search had stopped.  He emailed me a waiver form for me to sign (releasing the Venetian of any fault) so I could then receive my check.  My possessions are most likely long gone, but I still feel completely violated as if someone had physically snatched my belongings from me. What's even more disturbing is whoever has our bags hasn't made any attempt to contact us about our luggage, leading me to believe they managed to open the bags, take whatever they wanted, and ditch the rest of the items somewhere. 

So in the end I not only lost my possessions, but I also lost a bit of faith in humanity. 

Lastly, thanks to the Venetian, I've also developed anxiety over entrusting my possessions with anyone (ie other hotel bellhops; airport luggage check-ins; valet services; etc) so much so I will avoid using bellhops; I will carry on my luggage; and avoid using valet...and if that's not at all possible, I'm taking my valuables with me: LESSON LEARNED the hard way.

This joint would have been higher on my star list if not for a couple of issues on my last stay here... overall though I do like this hotel and have been here multiple times.

However on my last stay here I noticed the following things that made me disappointed and/or to shake my head in pure wonderment:
* There was mold in the shower on the ceiling and on the caulking
* There was lipstick on the pillow shams, confirms that they werent changed and washed! Which I always figure is the case... who knows what else is on those things...
* The no hat policy for the regular bars in the casino proper??? Seriously WTF... but flip flops and t shirts are ok? I mean can we at least have a sensical dress code here. You can go hang out while wearing flipflops and dance even while wearing basically anything but a hat. 

I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE NO HAT THING. I am a hat guy. I love wearing hats. If someone wants to wear a hat in a bar after 7pm when they are buying drinks why forse him to take off the hat? Is "hat hair" really so much "KLASSIER"? I dont think so in the slightest.

Some other observations:
* There are options for both free and paid wi-fi
* Great amenities like the Shark Reef, Wave Pool, Lazy River, etc
* Most of the table games have higher than average limits for the strip
* Lots of great free parking =D
* Its a great venue for concerts where even the back seats have a decent view of the stage and you can hear everything quite well.

The beds were comfortable and not overly soft as many hotels can be. The towels were fresh and that made me quite happy. Nothing worse than getting stained towels or ones with pubes hanging out in them...

As my last trip was a work related trip, I found that I was comfortable working at the desk and was able to spend a few hours there completely a bunch of photo editing without issue before heading down to play in the casino next door. =)

Overall I do recommend this place, unless you like to wear hats. Then its like you're in the hat Nazi zone if you want to hang out in one of the various bars or lounges there.

There is no question or doubt in my mind that Jol Robuchon deserves nothing less than five stars and is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

My company was hosting its annual holiday Vegas vacation, so I knew I wanted to dine somewhere nice as I rarely ever get the chance to when in Sin City with friends (typical meals include McDonald's, Earl's, and a buffet). I made reservations easily on the phone a month in advance and inquired about the complimentary limo service. I was told to call back 7-days before my dinner reservation to reserve. I called back 6-days before and was told there was no availability and was put on a waiting list. So when they say to call a week in advance, you better call a week in advance.

Our party of four didn't end up getting limo service or The Mansion tour, but Jol Robuchon is truly a beautiful restaurant and amazing enough on its own. Our jaws dropped in awe from the opulent dcor, grandiose chandelier, and elegant royal purple theme. The ambiance is lovely, romantic, and simply stunning.

Mignardises
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#BtWcKw5jrQKx8nNcMLUfjA
The mignardises cart was equally as impressive and stunning as the bread cart. There were over 20 selections of different sweet treats to choose from; it was pretty overwhelming. I wish I could've tried everything but I really didn't want to look like a fatty. My favorites from the cart were the canels and macarons.

Everything was delicious. The appetizers, the mains, the desserts, everything. I've been to 1- and 2-Michelin-star restaurants before, and now I finally know that that one extra star truly does make a difference. Le Homard (spiced lobster) was my favorite appetizer, followed by Le Navet Rouge (scallops). For my main, I ordered Le Bar (grilled sea bass), which was good but lost the round to La Langouste (spiny lobster) and Le Buf (braised beef cheeks). If I were to go back again, I'd definitely get the the beef cheeks; they were so tender and flavorful. Dessert was amazing -- if you're ordering any, you must get La Sphre, a bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberries, yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. It was so pretty and made my sweet tooth very happy. Le Souffl is also a must! Not too sweet, not too bitter, it went terrifically well with the vanilla ice cream it was served with. Perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. I would have to say however, both the amuse-bouche and mignardises were fairly mediocre when compared to the rest.

Service was good. Our water glasses were constantly refilled (explains how we ended up with a $40 tab on water alone), timing between courses was perfect (though there was a little hiccup between our last dessert course and mignardises), and while the staff was supremely attentive, they were also generally unobtrusive.

After our meal ended, the ladies in our group were each presented with a giant loaf of bread in a purple gift bag. If your meal doesn't fill you up, this bread definitely will.

This review is years overdue. I forget Yelp is for businesses beyond restaurants at times.

I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Knife House. I need to go there every once in a while just to hang out (and I always have to buy something). I've bought many a present here and I'm always itching to buy another knife for the house. 

Phoenix Knife House carries Japanese chef's knifes - which are only sharpened on one side. They're ridiculously sharp and so cool. We have a killer set of Wusthof's that we got for a wedding present that we don't really use anymore. And we just have a few knives from PKH. While we don't need anymore really, I have to get another soon. I'm going for the Sugimoto 8" chef's knife.

While they have some amazing, high end works of art (Damascus steel & such), they also carry a good selection of great knives that are super affordable.

Eytan, the owner, carries knives in typical Western shape and traditional Japanese form. He also has a bunch of killer kitchen tools. Absolutely love the kitchen shears he told us to get long ago and was excited to pick up a nice fish spatula recently.

This happens to be the place where many of the valley's local chefs do their knife shopping. Eytan has also expanded to carry some additional chef supplies so head over there if you need a chef's coat or clogs as well.

In addition to being an authority on knives, he's a master sharpener. He sharpens all kinds of knives, is super reasonable and has a quick turnaround.

In addition to the awesome product he has, Eytan is a major foodie. He is a former chef (SCI grad I think?) who worked at amazing places like Kai, Circa 1900, opened Fiamma here and did time in New York at spots like Aureole, La Cte Basque, and Craft.

He is also a great guy and a wealth of information on the local food scene. I'm always following up on  his recommendations.

Even if you have nice knives, you should check it out. Might get converted like I did!

I am utterly dissatisfied with the lack of consideration and care that the Club XS staff has for its attendees as well as the lack of organization. Last Saturday, August, 23rd, my wife and I were to meet with a group of our friends to celebrate a birthday. I called a promoter and we were put on the guest list for the night, however when we arrived, we discovered that my wife was only on the guest list and I had to wait in the general admission line, since only girls were put on the guest list for the night.

We separated, and she had my phone so that she show the confirmation text to the host at the door. I then proceeded to wait in the general admission line for 2 hours, only to stand there and watch as the VIP host, Kalani, continuously accepted bribes from other people so that they could get in faster. All the while, the head of the line that I was in barely moved the whole time. 

In fact, the only reason it did move is because most of the people in front of me left out frustration or bribed the host to get in. Then, when I got up to the counter, the price was $150, which was obviously raised during the time I was in line. I don't understand why you would raise the price of admission for those coming in later. 

When I finally got into the venue, it was packed beyond belief, to the point that it was an obvious safety hazard. I stood in the entrance for about 20 minutes because I could not go anywhere. My wife finally found me there, but was almost unable to because when she was let into the VIP outside pool area, the host at the club portion of the club told her she would have to wait in the general admission line if she wanted get into that portion of the club or she would have to stay in the pool area since she basically got in for free. Why would an attendee on the guest list have to pay to get into another part of the club?

When she found me we ended up leaving since there was no point in trying to find our friends. Our experience was a complete waste of time and money and I am very upset that I was unable to get what I paid for and the night was ruined because of mismanagement and greed. Also, we saw two girls get carried out in wheel chairs, and while I know their alcohol consumption is their own responsibility, the club XS is at least somewhat responsible for what happens to it's patrons. 

I understand this is probably a usual occurrence, considering it was Saturday night, but I still don't get how a club would allow it to get that packed every weekend.

This was supposed to be my Holy Grail of food experiences. I had heard nothing but great things about , I just had to find someone to go with that would be just as excited as I was to try it. Luckily, I found two people! We made our reservations 2 months in advance, knowing that there was 3 in our party, and they only seat 8 at a time, we thought it would be difficult since we had an odd number in our party. 

Finallly, the night came, I really couldn't contain my excitement for what was about to happen. We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. 

Out of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jamn, both were so salty I didn't finish either one. 

We all chose to do the wine pairing, which actually had beer and cocktails in the pairing. The alcohol was fantastic, although they were a little skimpy on the pours. Towards the end of the evening, we all felt they were rushing us a bit. There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. 

Reason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it. Like I said, I didn't leave mind blown. I def wouldn't recommend someone trying this as their first tasting.

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more. 

They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location.

Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.

I got the "Cranburkey" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  

I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!

My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the "happy side" of the menu.  She ordered the "Chix on Broadway".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   

I got a large "Mr Green" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.

The space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club.

Homigosh, The Buffet at the Wynn only has 950 yelp reviews? That must be some sort of Yelp record, no?

My friends and I decided to buffet dine at the Wynn since it was our last day in LV together. While all of us were sleep deprived, some were slightly hungover or depressed about not winning big! It didn't matter as we were so excited to eat at this famous buffet.

All I have to say is that this buffet is one of THE best ever. It's worth the wait (as I waited about an hour) and price ($40+) Lunch. Oh, and did I mention bottomless mimosas too for just a few extra bucks?

Look at what the main dining area looks like. Isn't it just simply gorgeous? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=A9lwzLYMlhlQkXyHs611DA

The food is absolutely amazing, as there are sections for breakfast, seafood, and other ethnic foods like Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.,
The presentation of the food was absolutely wonderful, and the chefs were hard at work always putting fresh and hot new trays of the highest quality dishes.

Everything I put on my multiple plates (from the eggs benedict, bacon, pasta, grilled fish, mashed potatoes, etc.,) was absolutely outstanding and delish. There wasn't one thing that I didn't enjoy eating. I died and went to heaven when I saw the dessert area. I couldn't stop saying "OH MYLANTA" with all of the cookies, pastries, cakes, and gelato galore. My fav was the pecan pie with a thin layer of chocolate inside the crust and the gelato. Num!
Here are a couple of pics - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=phkc9wlQM4f2D2__GDS87A
Beautiful Gelato and toppings

The Buffet at the Wynn is definitely a Wynner! Special thanks to Janice C for this awesome suggestion (and even Plan A, which I'll go to another time). This was a memorable lunch buffet with my pals, and cannot wait to go back!

I am a former employee writing this review anonymously to not be targeted at by the Studio Movie Grill. First, the PROS: Front of the house mgmt works really hard and knows how to really manage the place and keep customers happy; the only thing is the bathrooms. Always filthy. Note to mgmt - Make someone clean them at least every 2 hours. Its disgusting and disrespectful to the paying customers.  
   Next: CONS: Kitchen Management is the worst I have ever seen...ever. Employees are mentally abused on a daily basis and consistently yelled at through the whole work period. We worked really hard with getting food orders out on time with no breaks during the whole work period. The "F" word is thrown around by every single person in the kitchen hundreds of times everyday. When you're running back and forth by the door you can hear it. It is a very hostile work environment and many labor laws are being broken here. 
Also when I was running the food I saw a big fat COCKROACH; and I don't mean the ones you see in your home. I've never actually seen them in food, but have seen a few during my 6 mo employment, skitter across the floor. On the bright side, I haven't seen any in the theaters that I've delivered food to. I quit working here because it was disgusting. There is no sanitation in play in the kitchen. 15-20 kitchen workers and only 4-5 wear gloves. THAT'S RIGHT, WHEN YOU ORDER FOOD GUESS WHO HAS THEIR HANDS ALL OVER IT. Cross-contamination exists here. Food Poisoning is extremely high. The cooks grab raw chicken, burgers, chicken tenders, nachos, fries, cheese, and all of the fixings all with their bare hands that are NEVER washed during the whole time they are there. Ever felt sick after you ate? This is probably why. The Health Department needs called and this business needs to be reported to the Better Business Bureau. This place needs new kitchen management that knows what sanitation is.
  Also, the dish machine is broke so everything is half washed. You're lucky if the dish comes out clean. 35% of the dishes in this place is dirty. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but I'm very customer oriented and no establishment should  EVER put their customers at risk.

I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered "The Prosciutto" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich "panini" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. 

If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.

On the five-hour drive home, all I could do was talk Mr. W.'s ear off about how young and fresh [just like I like my men?] those crawfish were!  By far my most favorite place for crawfish, hands down.

Mr. W. was the one who had originally wanted to try out The Boiling Crab.  We've all heard how big they are in California and being that Arizona has HnJ and AC, BC was a temptress.  My friend had said it was oily like AC so I was really put off with that notion.  Ignoring her warning, we went to BC and it turned out to be my second favorite meal in Vegas for our trip!

Those crawfish were fresh!  The lungs were still white and not awkwardly grey or muddy; the head-fat wasn't bitter, black, or goopy but perfectly colored and sweet [head-fat that holds together in one sweet piece is an A+ in my book]; and the tail was so easy to break apart.  Chipping your nails trying to wrestle a tiny piece of tail-meat always leaves me salty so this makes me very happy.  The whole sha-bang sauce is pretty decent with chunks of garlic, not too spicy [this is where HnJ might have a *slight* advantage... their sauce is more broth-like] and not as oily as my friend made it out to be.  I enjoyed my every bit of my 2lbs. of crawfish and I will admit that I probably could have taken down another pound!  We also shared 1lb of lemon pepper shrimp, six raw oysters [plump, briny, and delicious] with lip-smacking spicy cocktail sauce [I liked to dip my crawfish meat in it every now and then], and a cup of gumbo [I recommend getting it with more sausage and shrimp].  Mr. W. had his heart set on the chowder but they sadly ran out.  Oh well.  Only means we have to stop by again!  I washed all this down with a sweet green tea and it was a great dinner in Sin City!

This restaurant is huge so a wait time was never an issue for us even at 6:00PM.  I love how sweet and attentive the wait staff is!  Pitchers of limes dumped onto the table?  Yes please!  I also like how they tie the bibs on you.  Ain't nobody got time for that in Arizona!  ;)  I'll be daydream of slurping the juice out of the head before ripping it apart for some head-fat!

Open 24/7 for all menu items, breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts and more!

I have not dined at Peppermill in 14 years, it was time to get my ass back to check it out to see if it was just as good as I had remembered! I live in Las Vegas so I can and will be able to enjoy this Restaurant on a regular basis now. 

This Restaurant Rocks! A total Gem in Las Vegas as there is no place like it!

The prices are fair considering the large portion of food you get. You are guaranteed to walk out stuffed so be hungry!

The scoop on what we got!

*All omelets are served with hash browns AND your choice of toast, english muffin, blueberry muffin, bran muffin or toasted bagel with cream cheese. 

Her-
Denver Omelet, 7 eggs at least, full of fresh diced ham, bell pepper and onion served with hashed browns, and choice of bread so I opted for a bagel with cream cheese. Even their own menu says "Huge omelets" and they are not joking! I was defeated for the first time in history in having to leave 1/3 of my omelet behind as that is a first! My omelet was cooked to perfection and so tasty, my tastebuds creamed in my mouth this meal was soooo good! $11.95

*Whole sandwiches served with choice of potato salad, french fries, cottage cheese, onion rings or fruit cup. Sweet potato fries for $1.00 more. I think it is awesome they don't charge more for onion rings like most places do!

Him-
Conquest sandwich w/onion rings. Combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, sauteed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon served on a grilled Parmesan sourdough. $12.95

Added salad for $2.95 and they have the best homemade ranch dressing I have ever had. I could drink a cup of it as it is that good!

Added side of potato salad. $3.95

Refills on our iced tea and soda were plentiful!

During our meal a guy came over to our table and took a complimentary photo of us! A free 4x6 photo souvenir is a really nice touch as the photo was printed with the Peppermill background, soooo cute! 

We had a blast eating here, it was just a really fun experience all together! It looks like a night club on the inside, really fun!

The Interior is dark and cozy! The service was good as well, they do take care of you!

We will be back very soon! Can't wait!

I am so happy I am a Vegas local who can enjoy this restaurant whenever I want!

It was just as good as I remembered when I ate here 14 years ago with my family during our visit to Las Vegas. This was my boyfriend's first time eating here and he truly enjoyed his food and experience!

Seems like pubs done by celebrity chefs are all the rage now.  I think it was a smart idea by Rick Moonen to change the upstairs of RM Seafood to this.  It's a really cool space with interesting furniture and displays.  I have no idea what steampunk is though.  I can only imagine Joey Ramone in a sauna.  

We chose to sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders and get their opinions on drinks etc.  It was also a treat to see them make some of these concoctions.  I know quite a few Yelpers that love the whiskey and this should be a spot to check out.  I will definitely try the smoked whiskey next time.  Check out some of the other people's pics.  

My wife wasn't into any of the specialty cocktails and opted for the appletini (ha fn ha).  But they used actual apple instead of that Pucker BS so it tasted as legit as an appletini could.  I went with some long titled cocktail called "Mario Warped the something something" which featured egg white, tequila and thyme.  It tasted like a margarita made by a mad scientist.  I also had a bottle of an Austrian lemon beer I'd never had before which was super refreshing.  

The chicken liver pate was just OK.  One of the bartenders tried to build up the fact that the pate was "like in this totally cool jar".  That'd be interesting if Thomas Keller hadn't already been doing that up the street at Bouchon since they opened.  I prefer duck liver pate any day of the week.  I'd skip this.  

Interesting idea with the inside out French onion grilled cheese but I feel like it totally missed the mark on both ends.  I'd rather have an excellent grilled cheese sandwich or a robust and cheesy French onion soup than this combo.  This is a skip too.

We both really liked the Lamb Osso Bucco Greek style.  Two gloriously tender shanks of lamb with orzo on the bottom that was swimming in the lamb juice.  Anthony M's picture of it is way better than mine.

Shockingly the best thing we had was dessert.  2 of the bartenders kept raving and raving about the green tea panna cotta with pineapple and macadamia nut cookie. It was definitely all that.     

I am rounding up on Rx Boiler Room.  It was more like 3.683712 stars but I think some of the dishes we passed on this first go around will be things I look forward to trying soon.  

Hey Rick!  How about a happy hour??

The Wynn Hotel and Casino is one of the top hotels in Las Vegas for two reasons. The employees do the little extra things that make you feel special and the place breathes class instead of oozing kitsch. If you're going to spend $30 extra to stay at a hotel in Vegas, the Wynn must be one of the first you check.  

 - The rooms will run you 2 bills and up which is just fine because the amenities and 600+ square feet are worth it when you are wanting a "better" vacation. 
 - Le Reve is a 4-star cirque-style in the water. We sat in the third row, but the circular theater looked like every seat had a great view.
 - I'm not a golfer, but the course looks beautiful. If you can't have a room with a view of the strip, getting one of this course is nice.
 - Lakeside is a nice restaurant to enjoy the Lake of Dreams
 - The Buffet is especially nice for dinner on weekends or holidays.
 - Save money on taxis because the 3 nightclubs (XS, Tryst, and Surrender) at the Wynn & Encore are bumpin!
 - the Esplanades at Wynn has high-end shopping too rich for my wallet, but still a guy can dream, right?
 - The Wynn pool is heated and a true Vegas party pool
 - The Casino is classy. They still will take your money, but in $25-$100 chunks instead of $10-$20 bites.
 - Housekeeping is wonderful. Need something? Ask. Seriously. Be prepared to tip.
 - Even the valet was great as he recommended we just walk instead of ride to the Venetian and then gave us bottle waters for the 5-minute stroll.
 - The worst part of the Wynn is the ever present voice of Steve Wynn telling you how awesome he thinks the hotel is. At some point, he needs to let the property, service, style, and experience speak for itself, but until then we are stuck trying to find a way to change the channel or hit mute.

Even if you don't rake in dough at craps or baccarate, you'll feel like a winner at the Wynn Las Vegas.

***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***

In terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).

There were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.

In terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.

There was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.

The breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).

The chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.

The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.

The eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.

In addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.

Service was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.

The price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.

The dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.

The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.

I know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.

My bf often tells me to just leave off the makeup.

That I don't need it.

Red eyelashes are unique.

He'll never quite get - that I like putting on makeup. It's my artistic release ritual for the day. 

I clutched my makeup filled suitcase tightly as I got off the flight to Vegas. I couldn't have been more thrilled about the makeup fests that were going to take place that weekend. Vegas is where you bring your sparkle. Vegas requires stage-makeup. The bright lights will wash you out. Everything is too much. And supposed to be.

So that first night, when we all realized that dinner plans at Koi would cut into our makeup time before watching La Reve. We knew that we needed an alternative dinner plan pronto. We rushed over to our concierge for advice.

Probably the most on-point concierge ever, Angie asked us about our time constraints, how far we wanted to travel - and recommended grabbing a spot at the bar at Okada.

Some of the best advice we received that whole weekend.

Okada was a swank, well lit, and beautiful space. It's easily a destination spot.  As soon as we arrived, we let our waitress know we were in a rush, and she seated us right away at the bar - right in front of the sushi chef. Within a couple of seconds - we had water, our menus, and were ready to order.

We ended up ordering the spicy scallop, yellowtail, tuna, shrimp tempura and eel & cucumber rolls to share

Connie also ordered an amazingly fruity and light sparkling sake.

Everything came out quickly and each roll was fresh and perfectly made.

At the end of the night, one of the roaming managers took it upon himself to pour us the last drops of the sake into our empty glasses. Unfortunately mine overflowed onto the table. Not a big deal at all. But within a minute or two - the manager returned with a new bottle on the house.

Now that's service!

Glammed up, with delicious sushi coating my Spanxed stomach, and time to spare before the show I was glad that we didn't make a made dash over to Koi.

Despite our limited time, Okada excelled in taste, service, and atmosphere.

You have got to be kidding me!!!

What narcissistic nincompoop came up with this idea?

This has just topped my list of "Most Asinine Restaurants in all of Las Vegas." and my list of "Stay the hell away - far away!" at the same time.

3 people, no drinks, one order of tacos each (4) and a very small Queso Fundito appetizer for $75 - THAT'S SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A DOZEN STREET TACOS AND BLAND CHEESE!

First off, the restaurant is so cold I was shivering - AND I'M FROM FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA.

The the Queso Fundito came to the table luke warm, which meant the cheese was already almost solid. We got the one with mushrooms, and they didn't taste bad, but cold Queso Fundito just sucks, period. It came with a spoon, which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.

Question: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. 

We ordered our appetizer, but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready, so we politely ordered, hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.

Boy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived, I got my tacos - just mine, apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. 

The other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.

I will not say the food was bad, but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1/3 the price. 

This place is PURE SHIT, an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. 

Pay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face, it will be a much better use of your money.

Recently, my husband and I made a trip to Las Vegas. Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we made reservations at his "Gordon Ramsay Steak" restaurant, in the Paris hotel. 
 
My husband wrote a great review of our experience but it wouldn't fit here.  So this is the condensed version.  We had a reservation on a Thursday night for 8:15.  We arrived on time and were told by the woman in front that it would be 10-15 minutes.  Go wait in the bar.  No I'm sorry, nothing, not even a smile when we walked up to her.  We were later told by a manager her name was Danielle.

We went into the bar and it was packed and had to stand.  15 minutes later a couple that had an 8:15 reservation left and we took their seats and ordered a drink.  My husband went to check with Danielle who held up her hand in an impatient "stop talking" manner,  and informed my husband "You are the next to be seated". Then immediately turned her back on him.

Then the people next to us who had an 8:30 reservation were seated.  I got up to talk to Danielle who was quite rude to me as well and informed me that "someone" was in there looking for us.  Apparently when you arrive Danielle writes down what you look like and when it's your turn to be seated she gives your description to a young girl who has to come in an find you.

Finally a young girl got us, at 9:00 for an 8:15 reservation.   I'm sure Danielle had forgotten about us and couldn't be bothered to apologize for her error.  We told the young woman you got us how displeased we were.  She had nothing to say and looked very uncomfortable.  We were seated and at this point I told my husband I just wanted to pay for our drinks and talk to the manager.  The waiter came and we told him, he apologized, first person to do so.  Then another man came up we told him the whole story, nope he was not the manager.  Finally the manager came up and by this time we were really upset.  He offered us a table near the kitchen.  There was no way I was going to spend several hundred dollars on dinner.  We had to repeat we just wanted our check, he comped us for the drinks.

So be aware, reservations mean nothing at GR Steak. We watch all of Gordan's shows, he always preaches STANDARDS.  Apparently he needs to teach some to Danielle and the hostesses of GR steak.

Pros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no "green" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.

It feels as if we've eaten in Jade Palace a zillion times over the years and have always had a great time. 

The food is very good, boarding on excellent. While the wait staff can be both inattentive and on top of you during the same visit. LOL But we keep coming back because it feels like home. It also reminds us of all those other great white table cloth Chinese restaurants we've eaten in over the years. 

We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and Jade Palace was full swing, with a few tables just being bused. Lucky us! The wait was less than five minutes. We were able to be seated at a booth off to the side. It had both the advantages of being intimate, as well as tucked away and out of sight. We sat for long period before we were able to flag down the owners son. But we hardly noticed since we were having such a great conversation. 

We were also fortunate on this visit to order off menu that delicious dish of Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce.  It was a reasonable $9.95, and a old favorite of mine. Sadly I couldn't make the same deal to get some Sichuan Won-Tons. Oh well, the Fried Pot Stickers for $5.95 were very good substitute!

Our appetizers were complemented by some Plum wine and LI Ice Tea.  My friend Marvin loves this place and so do we. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jade-palace-scottsdale-2?hrid=RRwVjbbyGOQSFkDY8VfAmA

For our entrees, we ordered the yummy General Tso's Chicken for $13.95 and the equally delicious Pork Lo Mein for $10.50. Both came with that individually prepared, layered taste that Jade is known for. We've eaten both here and the Jade up on Pinnacle Peak, but this is our favorite location. 

Our bill came to just over $30 per person, including drinks and we left feeling well satisfied with this exquisite Chinese meal. 

An energetic Four and half Stars, and yes we are most definitely Fans. 

Enjoy!!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW

Olive & Ivy is another one of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, one which we like. http://www.foxrc.com/restaurants/olive-ivy-restaurant-marketplace/

We came here after a movie on the Fourth of July around four. It was mostly empty and we felt we had the run of the place just to ourselves.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
On most nights this is a crazy busy place with a bar area that can get crowded very quickly. Yet on other nights...  well it can be empty. It tends to be more young, after work-ish, along with the 40s/50s who live nearby. Yesterday, there was a dozen of us evenly split, outnumbering the staff. 

MENU:
You have two menus to choose from, Dinner and Happy Hour. Both are incredibly large and diverse for the 3 to 6 HH period. The major difference between the two is the lack of pastas, and that the salads can only be found on the Dinner menu. See link: http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Olive_And_Ivy_Happy_Hour_Menu.pdf

SERVICE:
It can be a little uneven, though we find it mostly amusing. We were seated this time in the dining room, near the bar. The wait staff is off doing various things and completely out of sight. A hard thing to do considering the vast open expanse of the restaurant. LOL

They tend to drop off a dish and then get lost; only returning to the area to see if you are done. No water glass refills, no inquires to see if you want another drink, etcetera. 

After dropping off their signature pesto and bread, we were told absent-mindedly, "oh, it's our basil parmesan something-or-other". Really. LOL

FOOD:
The food is very good, with interesting layers for the palate. On this visit we started with the Fresh Mozzarella (photo)-- which comes with a yummy tomato jam with basil on top for only $4.00. Delicious. Then we each ordered a salad (photos) -- the Mediterranean that has couscous while the Butter Lettuce comes a' la BLT with gorgonzola cheese. 

The Med was huge, and large enough for two. It was only ten dollars though we added a chicken breast for an extra four dollars. We were less impressed with the Butter, since it came with only three small Bib lettuce leaves. It was very tasty, though small compared to the Med.  The wine selection is fairly large and fairly priced. See the photo of their huge transparent "Feature Wall" of wine by the bar. 

PRICES:
You'll find some Old Town price creep with some items, but it's not too crazy. The above salads were in the $12 to $14 range which seem about right. 

The HH menu tends to be in the $6 to $8 range and is generous.  Our bill came in just over $40 and we had an email 25% off coupon. That is something we like about being on the Fox Concept email list. There's at least one coupon or promotion going a month. Nice!

Enjoy!

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

Can I give negative stars? 
My boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said "here's your check please pay and leave." I said "Excuse me" and he responded "You are a waste of space at my bar." I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded "are you serious?" All he said was "Leave" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, "Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway." As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said "I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me.

"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN" 

That was one of the first things to pop into my mind when I first heard about our much loved Frost Bites Shavery opening a possible new second location somewhere near Chinatown.  Now that FBS has opened at Seoul Plaza (where you can find: Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Wong, Japanese Curry Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya, Kabuto and that awkward "massage" place where tourists leaves via taxi with a big grin on them faces) rebranded itself as SnowFlake Shavery, the famous partial quote by the American author Horace Greeley  about westward expansion and Manifest Destiny could be applied to our favorite shaved snow biz from Hendertucky.  +2 for just being soooo mucho more closer to the Westsiders. 

For those that have not tried shaved snow from SFS before, it is not the shaved ice you might have tried before with colorful syrups poured over the coarse shaved ice.  It is a more refined icy treat with powder snow or frozen cotton candy-like melt-in-your-mouth experience.  Think shaved ice version 2.3, so to speak.  All made with 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS, no artificial flavorings or syrups used (which is the reason why taro is not one of the available flavors - sadly artificial taro flavorings trumps all natural taro shaved ice made from real taro only).

Ordering 101:

Step 1:  Choose a size: Small, Large, Monster
Step 2:  Choose a flavor:  From Vanilla, Cantaloupe to Green Tea and Black Sesame.
Step 3:  Add a topping ($0.50 per selection):  Fresh fruits to candy and cereal.
Step 4:  Top it off with a sauce (first one free, +$0.25 after that one):  Condensed Milk, Strawberry Condensed Milk, Chocolate and Caramel.

If you are not sure, they also have helpful combos for you to pick from or help jump start your shaved snow creativity.  Although I have had Green Tea and Black Sesame Shaved Snow all by itself, and didn't think it needed any toppings or sauce. It is that good!

Come and try it now that it is closer for everyone that does not live in Henderson.

I think it is better than the ones I tried in SoCal and Taiwan (except the fresh mango from Taiwan is way better).

Here are just a sampling of other real customer testimonials:

Cathy C loves this place, because it is dessert sans guilt.
Sandy K said it is so good it is like [frozen] crack.
Norm K said Mango with coconut sounds good to me!
Philip T thinks he like this more than frozen yogurt now.
Roger T thinks Green Tea + Mochi + just a drizzle of Condensed Milk is dessert heaven.

So what you be waitin' for? Come get some SnowFlake!

Are you a wanna be competitive eater?  Member of a Greek fraternal organization looking for out of the box activities?  Do the Shaved Block Ice challenge!  Successful competitors earn the coolest bragging rights in town + extra(?)


DISCLAIMER:  To harry I:  I am not a shill (I am deeply offended by being called that even if I had to first look it up in a dictionary).  And I am not a professional reviewer, but I will take that as a compliment.  And I believe in paying for the products and services from businesses (I want to review the customer service and experience that everyone gets), and writing a honest review of my personal experience.  If I happened to be passionate about it and write the review with flair, all the better.  Being new to Yelp you should read Yelp's Terms of Service, plus the site's Content Guidelines and Review Guidelines.  You can go back to tell your celebrity chef friend that if he is really passionate about the food he serves, he will not be using artificial powders. Is his product bad? NO.  But it is like comparing real orange juice (SnowFlake Shavery) to SunnyD (KSC).

Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athne in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!

The Sparklings is such a cool and unique new restaurant. I love it! The first thing you notice about the place is the atmosphere. There's a beautiful chandelier in the center of the room and there are individual dining rooms that are separated so it's almost like you are eating in your own private dining room. Then there's an area that reminds me of a kitchen with a line of china cabinets along the wall. Outside of the main room there is a separate bar area that you can see thru glass windows. You have to see the place yourself to appreciate their whole vibe that they've got going on and it's hard to explain, just trust me. It's a place you're going to want to come to and take guests to, to impress them when they come in from out of town. It's just one of those quirky-chic spots that you will always remember.

Jason, our quick witted server was great! I have a good little banter going on with him every time I visit which makes my experience fun.

My absolute favorite thing to order is the Spicy Seafood Pasta. It has the perfect amount of kick and garlic to it. Noodles are always cooked perfectly. And there's a lot more to the menu that I haven't gotten to try yet. I tend to be a creature of comfort though and if it ain't broke don't fix it so I find myself sticking to my old faithful Spicy Seafood Pasta when I eat here. Some favorites that I recommend would be definitely that along with the Crispy Gnocchi.

My only suggestion to the owners of The Sparklings would be to add more main course dishes to their menu. Lots of appetizers to choose from but not much to choose from in the main dish department. Other than that, I have no complaints. They treat me well and remember me and what I order every time right down to the smallest detail, for example: the crushed red peppers I like on the side. Don't even have to ask. Service is excellent! 5 stars. :D

Since arriving in Arizona, I've made a promise to myself to visit a new coffee shop every week I'm search of the best coffee shop experience that Arizona has to offer. This week's stop was Village Coffee Roastery. 

The moment I walked in, I felt an indescribable feeling of joy. I don't know what it was exactly that struck me about this place, perhaps it was the roasting contraption right in the front with a handful of comfy chairs around it. Perhaps it was the blue tile half wall surrounding the bar area or the chalk board menu. I'm not sure what it was but I felt at home right away. The barista behind the counter greeted me as if I was a friend, we chatted a bit about the menu, I made a joke about their "Why Bother" drink. That's a non fat sugar free vanilla latte to those not in the know. I asked about their For Here mugs and he took the time to go over the sizes of the mugs. I ordered cappuccino and he asked if I like it dry or wet and I was blown away that he asked. THANK YOU! As a matter of fact, I like mine on the drier side. I stood by while he started it and he told me to go have a seat and he'd bring it out to me. What service! 
 
 When he presented my drink I geeked out over the foam and he asked if I needed a wifi code. So thoughtful! I sat back and enjoyed. I actually found myself sitting there, smiling to myself. Purely and utterly happy. Here's the kicker. Usually, at a coffee shop, I stick my earbuds in and ignore the world for a while. Not today. Their music selection was so perfect, so wonderful that I didn't bother. I could live at Village Coffee. I was one of 4 customers there and it really felt as if I was sitting in my own private, wonderful piece of heaven. 

My experience at Village was so great, I want to take a star away from every other coffee shop I've been to because none if them have compared to this place.

Eddie Griffin popped my Comedy Show cherry this week and now I want more! Holy Bat balls was he funny. I've been spending the rest of the week just trying to remember everything he said and retelling anyone who will listen to me.

 My favorite was when he was clowning on 50 Cent. He said he thinks he is a gangsta. He got shot 8 times in one incident. That N**** ain't no gangsta. He should change his name to Bullet Catcher! The N**** who shot him without wasting a single bullet and no one knows his name is a effin gangsta. 

Ka-kow!

HE PERFORMED FOR OVER TWO HOURS. I was rollin the whole time. The more he drank the funnier he became. He talked about hoes, Jesus, how he wants to bang Michelle Obama, how Snoop's so skinny you can see his back through his chest, etc. Nothing was off limits and I couldn't get enough. If you like comedy you have got to see his show. Tickets aren't cheap so don't take anyone with you who wouldn't appreciate it or who has bad breathe or body odor because that would suck to have to smell that shit for two hours long. I even had a backstage pass to meet his ass, but believe it or not I got shy and chickened out like a big, fat vagina.  

Now for the venue. For starters, King's Room is not at Crown. It is separate and in a small, dark, intimate theater. When you walk in you think you are waiting to get into the Haunted Mansion. The seats are not all that comfortable, but I'm not that picky. They have a bar inside the show and Kat Von D's ugly stepsisters as waitresses come around the whole time to keep you buzzed. There is a bathroom inside, but I didn't dare get up and go for fear of missing a single joke. 

Advice. Go early and be one of the first to go inside the showroom. You want to sit as far away from the front door as you can. Rio still has that gay flying boat show where they toss the beads and you don't even have to flash for them. It's obnoxiously loud and it will disturb you if you are close to that door. 

Other than that this place and specifically this show is real cool. Stop taking life so seriously for a night and go get your laugh on. It just might make the weight of the world feel a little lighter after.

I have had this place on my Yelp bookmarks ever since this place opened up in Vegas about 9 months ago. I finally got to try it recently!

Walking in the place is a small and quaint. There are roughly less than 10 tables and they put together a couple for our party of 7. When we first got there, we stood at the front for a couple minutes because there was no host to greet us or seat us. It turns out only one guy was working that day. He actually turned out to be a pretty pleasant and nice server. I unfortunately did not catch his name but he was a young Filipino guy who was very accommodating and friendly).

This place is not a turo-turo where items are already cooked and you just choose. Each dish is freshly prepared and cooked after you order.

We ordered the following:
Chop suey (mixed vegetables): $7.99 (on the special menu that day)
Caldereta (beef dish): $11.99 (on the special menu that day)
Sugpa liempo (pork belly slices): $12.99 (family size) 
Pancit bam-i (noodles): $9.99 (family size) 
Boneless bangus (milkfish): $12.99
Ngo-Yong (egg roll): free with yelp check-in

Each dish came with 1 scoop of rice

Although we ordered the family size portions, many of the dishes could also be ordered solo size for a smaller portion.

From what we ordered, taste wise I liked the Ngo-Yong eggroll (crispy and delicious), sugpa liempo (flavorful and tender pork belly) and the pancit-bami (good mix of noodles). 

Portion wise some dishes like the Caldereta and the chop suey were small. I thought these were a little pricey for what we got. I also wished the Ngo-Yong egg roll was bigger. It was small and I left wanting more of it because it was that good! The best value were the pancit bam-i and sugpa liempo.

One thing to note when paying is that for parties of 6 or more they add 18% gratuity automatically to your meal.

Overall, I really enjoyed the food here! It was delicious! That Ngo-Yong egg roll is my new favorite. I am very happy to have another place for authentic Filipino eats in Vegas!

Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:

- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.

- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.

- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.

SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.

ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.

We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.
  
Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. "European-style" Cultured Butter I would say.

From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.

To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.

Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.

My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.

Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. "Oh I think you would want that wine filtered", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. "Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle", not a problem and immediately it was done. 
They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. 

If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.

It was a dark and gloomy Sunday night in downtown Phoenix. It was 6:30 Pm. On any other day in this city the streets would be lit up with restaurants eagerly proclaiming "we're open! we're open! come on in! give us your money!" 

But not on Sundays. On Sundays everyone closes their doors and goes home. As invisible as magic, unicorns, and Mariah Carey's acting talent. 

It was Nathan's birthday, and Amanda B and I took it upon ourselves to devise a place suitable for a birthday dinner. You might as well have asked us to perform brain surgery with a screwdriver and a plunger.

"Two Hippies?"
"Closed."
"That BBQ place you like?"
"Closed."
"Um...there's a Pizza Hut---"
"Uh, no."
"Sorry."

Yeah. Guess which one I was in that exchange.

Finally we came upon Mamma Mia's, and collectively griped at how we had forgotten our "freebie" chips from the Birthday pARTy. Thankfully, they were open, though you wouldn't have known it by the way the girl ushered us through the kitchen to the dining room.

There are two types of people who order pizza. There are those who, when asked their preference, list all the toppings they like. And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza. With the latter option, everyone gathers around the menu and lists off what available toppings they wouldn't eat. Through the process of elimination, you pick from the available toppings and come with a democratically agreed upon pie.

And that's how we decided on basil and fresh tomato slices. With a side order of meatballs.

"How many meatballs come in a side?" asked Nathan.
"Five."
"That's perfect."

At first I was skeptical. How is five perfect for a party of three people? Who taught you to do math, birthday boy? Big Brother?

Thankfully I kept those thoughts to myself...I know, even I was impressed with myself.

And I'm glad I did, because the meatballs were big, saucy and  spoonable, since our party of three only managed to get two sets of plastic silverware. I guess it's not just Nathan who's math is a little fubar'd.

The pizza was rather superb. So superb that, even armed with only basil and tomatoes, it was enough to satiate a palette accustomed to deep dish pepperoni sausage with buffalo sauce and buffet breadsticks.

This was like re-education for my taste buds, but without the hard labor and Chinese man screaming in my face about how awesome communism is.

The question about whether my hair was real or not aside, the staff were  accommodating and friendly. 

If I ever find myself lost in the dark and lonely place that is downtown Phoenix on a Sunday after 6pm, I will definitely keep Mamma Mia's in mind. And I will remember my "freebie" chips. 

Dear Phoenix,

This isn't Salt Lake City. Cut this Sunday nonsense out.

Love,
Me

I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)

As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! 

So I ordered a "Vienna All Beef Hot Dog" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a "Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. 

They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.

They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place.

Little Darlings is an intimate chain of clubs owned by Deja Vu.  The club is 18+ as they do not serve alcohol and thus is fully nude.  Little Darlings is a little different than most clubs as it seems more personal and thus a better experience for some one on one dances.  I've found this to be the case at several Little Darlings' locations.

My most recent visit was this past 4th of July.  My party and I had some club passes and called to reserve transportation.  The limo was promised within thirty minutes and was at our hotel within the time frame.  The driver was courteous and friendly and let us know the club was busy and had about 30 girls working that night.  The passes include free cover and only require tipping the driver and buying bottomless drinks ($10).  There was a line of about ten patrons in front of us that moved painfully slow.  We waited in line a good fifteen minutes.  The staff was unorganized, uninformed, and just plain bad. They had a hard time honoring the military discount and were forced to call over a manager.  However, I didn't mind waiting, as the hostess had some big titties and I was already buzzin.

Once our IDs were checked and my military buddy got his free perks (free drinks and a $50 gift card), we made our way inside.  The club had a free BBQ buffet going, but didn't look to appealing to myself.  The club was busy and most of the seating was being occupied, yet we managed to sit by the stage.  The girls were plenty and were walking around by the second stage in front of the bar area.  The club is very relaxed and I never felt bothered by the strippers.  I was only approached one or two times for dances due to the tight seating near the main stage.  Most strippers congregate in a designated corral, which makes it easy for getting your girl.

The quality of girls was better than average and consisted of white girls, black girls, and a few Latinas.  I don't recall seeing any Asian girls, however.  Lap dances start at $20 and steadily climb from there.  If you choose a girl, which you should, I URGE you to get a BED DANCE.  The dance is no average lap dance on a couch.  Instead, you're put on to a bed that resembles a doctor's table and for lack of better words, you're dry fucked non stop with YMMV depending on the girl.  The bed dance is unique to Las Vegas and is nothing that I've experienced in San Francisco, Los Angeles or San Diego.  If you do anything, I strongly recommend getting a bed dance.  Little Darlings is a gem and definitely worth a visit. My only complaints is the unorganized staff and the slow security screening, which included a metal detector.

Little Darlings Pricing Structure:

Cover:  Varies (Free to $30)
Locals and tourist: $20 plus $10 for unlimited drinks, utilize club passes.

Lap Dances:
Bed Dances & Private Dances (Topless & Nude): $20+

$20 is the cost for one lap dance, however your mileage may vary per girl, pay more get more is the formula.

VIP Dance:  $100+

VIP Section: $100+ Minimum

Holy goodness, this was awesome. Tonight I had a dining experience so amazing that I can't even attempt to be hateful, catty and mean about it. BLT Steak is the best restaurant in the Valley, for realz.

The Camelback Inn is a beautiful property and BLT Steak fits right in. The dining room and patio directly faces south on Lincoln, giving you a breathtaking view of Camelback Mountain. This served as a great reminder that I will have to hike my fat ass up Echo Canyon about 50 times to work off all the beef I'm about to devour. Inspirational!

The bar has attentive service, stiff drinks and serves complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with some wizardy spices sprinkled on top. Score - because I like to pre-eat before I sit down and eat. (not being sarcastic)  

The servers are great - I think we had a separate food server and beverage attendant, which was fancy and efficient - too things that rarely go hand in hand.

But the real highlight was the food. I don't even know where to begin. I'll list everything I ate, and describe it, if I can:

Bread with pate: The only thing I didn't like, but I'm not a fan of liver. Not their fault.

Moving on...

Fresh Popovers with euro butter: The second best bread experience of my life, second only to the GIANT BREAD CART at Le Louis XV, Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monaco. (An EPIC journey in dining and a must visit for anyone who lives to eat)

Hamachi: The freshest buttery yellow tail that ever lived - or lived than died. Whatever - it was dope.

Shrimp Cocktail: Holla! 

Chopped Salad: This was pretty good - but more like a greek salad hybrid. I'd skip it in favor of the...

Buffalo Mozzarella Salad: Jackpot! Cheese so soft it melted. Fresh yellow tomatoes, great dressing etc.

Filet: The best filet I've had in Arizona, dethroning Maestros and Donovan's, for sure.

Ahi Tuna: Rare, plump, buttery, holy shit.

Glazed Carrots: I'm obsessed with carrots, particularly cooked ones, and I don't know why. These carrots were off the hook and I almost ate the whole a la carte bowl.

Hash Browns: The fact that the hashies came in huge hunks of hash brown pie was pretty awesome and ridiculous

Pecan Pie: Dope, and ice-creamy

Fruit Crepe:I  wasn't a fan - too passion fruity for me. But my dining partners dug it.

Random Complimentary Dessert Cookies: A nice surprise

Sauces: Holy f-ing crap - they offer all these random sauces like peppercorn sauce, horseradish and a mustard trio. Order them ALL even though they are $3 each. Totally worth it!

I really liked this entire experience. I left fat and stuffed and happy - and didn't even feel sick or like I had to RUN - not walk - to the bathroom immediately after. Similar dining experiences at steakhouses make me dash for the loo. I know - gross. But you know it happens to you too.

BLT Steak 4E, bitches. Seriously.

I apologize for the length of this review, but accurately explaining their appalling lack of courtesy and organization is no small feat. An experience at the Encore Beach Club can only be explained as an expensive, infuriating trip through airport security.

Maybe I was spoiled by the amazing service everywhere else during my stay at the Encore. Maybe I'm the unreasonable one for expecting a consistent level of service throughout the same company. Everywhere else in the Encore (including the other clubs) has amazing service. At the Beach Club, it's a borderline police-state.

Me and my girlfriend spent the previous day at the Encore's European pool and had a blast. We also went to the Encore's nightclub, XS, the night before and had a great time there as well. I expected the Beach Club to be a hybrid of these two positive experiences, but the end-result was the worst of both worlds.

When we showed up at 2pm, pre-purchased tickets in hand, we were surprised to see that there was only two lines; one for cabanas, one for all other guests, no expedited line for hotel guests and/or ones with advance-tickets. We had to wait in line for almost an hour.

There is only one sign while you're in line which warns you of the pool's policies: "no illegal drugs allowed". In case you can't read, the manager, Alfonso, reinforces the point with an indiscriminate TSA-esque verbal berating of everybody waiting in line. There were no other signs posted about any other policies.

Once we got through that line, we encountered an unexpected baggage inspection of my girlfriend's purse. This is nothing like the Encore's nightclub, XS, which had no bag-inspection whatsoever. The inspector said that the purse had to be checked at the baggage claim for $10. We had to wait in line at the baggage claim for about 15 minutes to do this.

It should also be noted you basically can't have any pills in your bag. If you're on any medical regiment requiring pills being taken at a specific time of the day, you're out of luck. It's easier for them to assume that everybody is addicted to opiates than to show any level of accommodation.

We finally get into the party. It looked like it might have been fun, but honestly, not fun enough to overcome our frustration with their whole set-up. The place was crowded, and was composed of over 75% guys. What few girls that were there would segregate themselves into their own cliques and there was very little interaction between the two sexes; very similar to a middle-school dance.

We get to the bar (15 minute line there). I order a round of drinks and ask to charge it to the room. The bartender says I need to show my key to do so (out of all the Wynn bars where I charged drinks to the room, this was the only place to require my room key; of course, no warning of this inconsistency posted anywhere). The key was left in my girlfriend's purse in baggage claim, so we had to go back there and wait in line another 10 minutes to get the bag. Out of frustration, we left after this.

On the way out, I asked to speak to the manager and was referred to Alfonso, who was socializing with a content group of girls. When he saw that I was waiting to talk to him, he asked what I wanted. I said "I'd like to talk to you when you have a minute", in a polite but clearly irritated tone. He told me to wait by a nearby tree. He then walked off with the group of girls and continued their trivial chit-chat (my girlfriend overheard their conversation and confirmed it didn't regard a serious matter whatsoever). After unsuccessfully waiting 15 minutes for their conversation to finish, I finally gave up and left for the European pool.

All-in-all, I wasted $60 and two hours for the privilege of waiting in countless lines and being treated like a felon. No drinks were ordered, no music was enjoyed, nothing.

I understand that this event was open to non-hotel-guests and it creates the potential for undesirables to enter. However, why create the illusion of exclusivity if you're not actually going to be exclusive?

The Wynn is supposed to be better than this. Instead of being a follower trying to emulate the Hard Rock Hotel, it should be a creating an experience strictly aimed at its target demographic. Until then, the Beach Club is simply a bastardization of the Wynn brand.

Favorite Villa Pizza in all of Vegas. I drive out of my way and pass another Villa next to my office to dine at this one. It's got the golden ticket.

Why? Because when Carmine (the original owner of all the Villa Pizzas in Vegas) sold most of his Villa pizza shops they were not allowed to continue using his secret recipe which was the main reason Villa was so popular. Kim and Kanye should consider naming their love child Carmine after him because the sauce is THAT amazing. THIS location however was one of the only ones who were special enough to get to keep the recipe! Their sauce is money up in here! All of the other factors of the pie are high quality to make it one solid pizza.

Also get their chicken fingers and ranch. It gets the job done. All white meat, crispy, humongous and just right.

Prices and service are decent, too. They currently have coupons in the Entertainment book and also run specials. The restaurant is small, but I don't expect the Ritz when I'm grabbing a slice. It's clean and smells of garlic and red sauce and that's all I need to give me strength to return to my cube and face my never ending Inbox of work emails. 

If you are in the neighborhood or live on the Moon. I don't really care. Drive over here and try this mystic pizza. It's golden and just might make your day a little brighter.

One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall dcor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe. 

The first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.

The Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.

The Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta. 

The Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.

Another item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.

These meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish. 

For drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.

The food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back.

I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.  Below is a copy of my complaint filed to the Nevada Taxi Authority and to members of upper management at Desert Taxi Inc:

      On the morning of June 22nd, 2014, shortly after 2:00AM, I was leaving the Electric Daisy Carnival event at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  I was attending the event with my girlfriend (name omitted for privacy) and my two friends from Florida.  I had attended the carnival the night before and developed a severe cold.  My friends ended up staying at the carnival until 5:00 AM that night, but unfortunately, I was forced to leave early due to extreme fatigue from the illness. We left the carnival at 1:30AM, but did not make it to the taxi line until after 2:00AM.
     The taxi that was assigned to us was Taxi #4238.  The car was blue and was decorated with Mirage advertising.  The cab driver looked to be in his 30's, with a very dark skin complexion, short hair that didn't appear to be more than an inch long, but it was curly at the time, and an accent that sounded Middle Eastern.  
     The first thing the driver said to me when we got in the car was "So much how are you going to pay me?"  I noticed that his meter was off, and I asked him, "I will pay you the amount that the meter says I need to pay, but why is your meter turned off?"  He proceeded to say, "It doesn't work like that.  This is a special event.  We do not use meters during special events. We negotiate a price upfront for the ride."  Next, he asked me how much I had paid to get down here.  I informed him that we paid $45 for our group via a private driver/shuttle.  He stated, "Oh no, $45 will not work that is way too low, how about you give me $100?"
     At this point, I knew the driver was trying to hustle me and was breaking the law, but he had all ready driven at least a mile away from the speedway.   He asked me again to pay him $100, and I tried to negotiate a rate of $80 instead.  I did not have much of an option at this point.  He told me that $80 was not enough and then again asked for $100.  After denying his request for $100 for a third time, he slammed on his breaks in the middle of the freeway.  The car came to a complete stop 2-3x faster than what would be considered a safe stopping distance.  We were sitting in the middle lane of the freeway, completed stopped, while he demanded the money once more.  I again, restated that I was only going to pay $80.  He asked me if I was paying cash or credit.  I told him cash, he flipped on his meter, and floored the accelerator.  He proceeded to speak to someone on either a radio or cell phone and was telling them, "This is bullshit. It's not worth it."
     We continued down the freeway for roughly 7 miles when he started demanding that I pay him the money immediately.  I pulled the $80 out of my wallet, showed it to him, and advised him that I would pay him upon arrival.  He stated that I had to pay him immediately.  After denying his request for a 3rd time, he again, slammed on his brakes in the middle of the freeway, came to a complete stop, and told me to "pay him the $80 now or to get out of the fucking car."  With the condition that I was in, I could not take the risk that he would leave us stranded in the middle of the freeway if I did not pay him.  Against my better judgment, I paid him the $80 and he proceeded to drop me off at the hotel.  
     After I got out of his car, I wrote down his taxi cab information.  I noted that the amount listed on the meter was $45.90 when I stepped out of the car.  I called Desert Taxi on Sunday and left a message to speak with a supervisor.  My call was returned on Monday, but I was not available.  I called back on Tuesday, spoke to Larry, and I explained what happened.
     I consider the actions of the taxi driver on that night to not only be illegal, but highly dangerous as well.  By slamming on his breaks and coming to a complete stop in the middle of the freeway twice, he put my life in danger as well as my girlfriends.  This taxi driver obviously has no regard for the law, and his words/actions/threats/harassment towards my girlfriend and I are not fitting of any decent member of society.  I have filed a complaint with the state of Nevada Taxi Authority and will continue to explore other options on how to handle this moving forward.  Due to this experience, I will never take another taxi cab in the city of Las Vegas again.  I will gladly back my statement up in any court of law, and I attest under penalty of perjury that everything stated in this complaint is 100% factual.  This document will be coming from my personal e-mail address.  Please count that as my signature for the document.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

Apparently they do flip you over in Vegas!

With a party of five, I called ahead to make sure they had room for all of us since we were on a schedule.  Vivian Q. was really friendly and said she would call me right back to confirm that she had enough employees there.  Not even five minutes goes by and she calls to confirm that we have an appointment!

Three of our friends were put into a semi-private room near the front, while myself and another friend were put in a room in the back.  I did ask if Rex was working, but he was off at the time I went.  (He now has his own business.)  Jason was the one who worked on me and he was quite aggressive and thorough.  When they flipped me over for some back work, I realized there was no hole for my face to go into, so I had to turn it to the side.  Unfortunately, my friend next to me didn't realize there was no hole for awhile and so she couldn't breathe!  (However, the chairs in the front room do have holes for your face to go into.  So, I guess it depends what chairs you get.)

At the end of the massage, they do this thing where they lift your legs up and drop them.  Well, the minimally covered chair he dropped my legs onto hurt a bit and he realized immediately that it wasn't as cushioned as perhaps the other chairs they have.  But out of habit, he did it again, and *thunk* my legs bang onto the chair.  Another apology comes out.  He also sat me up again to do some further shoulder work on me.  

Overall, I got some mixed reviews from my friends.  Some felt it was too much face and head work for them, while others didn't mind.  Another girl didn't know what to do during the whole hour...it was her first time! 

We also got a $2 Yelp discount off the 60 minute price at the time.

They do accept credit cards, but we tipped in cash.

3. 5 stars.

The Husband had a chance to experience Good Foot Spa on his own after winning a gift certificate from a Yelp event.  (Actually, I won it but gave it to him since he's never been.)  He felt it was pretty good and appreciated getting flipped over.  And yes, he fell asleep.  Always a good sign.

Original prices: (Call ahead and ask for Vivian Q. to get a Yelp discount!)
$28 = 45mins 
$38 = 60mins
$48 = 75mins
$58 = 90mins

Yay! I just happen to be their 100th reviewer!

First of all, shame on me for not coming here sooner because they have been here at least a year and half in this nice location across from the Cannery Casino. Old School Pizzeria is just that. Old school. They make everything from scratch right in front of you. 

I ordered the Rosemary Garlic Knots and a Monster slice of The Carnivore. 

The Rosemary Garlic Knots were exquisite! I have had garlic knots before but these babies are now the standard I will judge others by. Let me describe it. Please have a bib or a napkin ready because you will be drooling. These are not your basic garlic knots. These knots are baked with actual rosemary leaves and real garlic cloves tossed in a light olive oil. I had them sit in the oven a little longer so it would make the outside even more crispy. When you take that first bite, it's comparable to one of those scenes you would see in any basic movie when somebody has a flashback and relives all those fun, awesome times, all in fast forward because by then that first bite is on its way to your stomach. Oh, and don't forget about the ranch dipping sauce that comes with it. Definitely did not come from a bottle. I assume they made it fresh because it was really creamy and made me want to drink it.

As for the monster slice of The Carnivore, the description is very fitting. If you refer to my pic, I put a pepper shaker right next to it so you can comprehend its dimensions. Now I have had good thin crust New York style pizza before, but this crust was SOURDOUGH! Now sourdough bread by itself I am into, but as the crust for the pizza? Stupendous! As you can assume by the name, it has all the meats they have available. From my recollection it had sausage, ham, chicken, pepperoni, and bacon. Usually when I get to the end crust, I just put it aside, but this crust was so good especially dipped in the ranch dressing, that it would make other sourdough bread jealous.

As an honorary mention, I gotta say that their bathroom is nicely decorated, clean, and has a fresh scent to it. It's so nice that I hope to God that none of those idiot hooligans jack it up with their sharpies and scratch things up. Memo to those low lifes: What kind of jerk are you to vandalize things and make it a sight for sore eyes? Anyways, sorry I kind of strayed off the beaten path there.

So now that you got this far in my review, I just want to reiterate one thing. Whatever you get here, make sure the Rosemary Garlic Knots is one of them. The pizza comes in a very close second because it compliments the former. Sometimes, you just gotta go old school! Old School Pizzeria that is!

It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.

My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.

Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.
Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup. 
 "Why is that?" Brenda asked.  
 "Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy," replied the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's 7:54," Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.)
 "It says 8:00pm on my clock," "says the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,"  I chimed in.
  "Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around."

Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to "hang around," why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?
Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.
This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

I got a reputation around Yelp when it comes to Ramen. I've eaten at every major Ramen-Ya on the West coast, so I got a lot of credibility when it comes to recognizing a good bowl of Ramen. So my assessment is that: SHOKU RAMEN-YA doesn't have a good bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen...SHOKU has a GREAT bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu. 

Things have changed a lot here in the last month. I came here over a month ago during their soft opening,  and the manager was still training the cooks and servers to be more proficient. Today when I came to SHOKU, everything had been perfected. I have to congratulate the new manager(Ehren) for working non-stop around the clock, and dedicating his whole life into turning this place into one of the best Ramen-Yas in Las Vegas. The flavor of the Hakata Tonkotsu was a world of difference from last month! You can really taste the pork bones and marrow from them preparing the broth all day long in that traditional Kyushu style. 

The Charsu has changed as well. It's very soft, fatty, and tender like the ones you get at Onizuka Street. I loved it! 

Unlike 99% of the Ramen-Yas in LV, SHOKU actually has a Hanjuku Egg as one of their add ons. This is big! This really BIG!  Monta, Sora, and Shuseki only have normal medium-boiled eggs. A Hanjuku egg needs a lot of work to prepare correctly. It needs to be boiled for exactly 7 minutes to preserve it's extremely runny nature, then it must be instantly placed into ice water or the egg will continue to cook itself and the yolk will be ruined.Afterwards it's transferred to a mixture of shoyu, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. It will then be marinated for many hours. SHOKU is the only Ramen-Ya in Vegas that features this style of egg. It's a very rare delicacy here in LV. 

The Bacon Fried rice was the best Japanese fried rice I have ever had. Better than Monta...Better than Yagyu Yakinku..Better than Shuseki. The Bacon Rice here at SHOKU RAMEN-YA is a perfect fusion blend of flavors. It has the buttery qualities of Hibachi Fried Rice(ex-Benihana), but with much stronger and unique added flavors. Because SHOKU is a Bachi Burger spinoff, their cooks do fusion better than anyone. 

The manager of this restaurant told me that in a few weeks they will add Tan Tan Men onto the menu. I was like HOLY SH!T THIS IS HEAVY! Every Yelper knows that Tan Tan Men is my favorite Ramen variation in the world. I've been to every major Ramen-ya on the westcoast and only like 8 of them had Tan Tan Men. For those who don't know, Tan Tan Men is a very difficult dish to master for any chef. That's why there are Ramen-Yas that specifically specialized in ONLY Tan Tan Men. I've been to Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses where TTM was the only thing on the menu because the chef needed to put all his attention in only that one thing. I can't wait to see the SHOKU variation of Tan Tan Men. Ehren is one of the most talented restaurant managers in Las Vegas, and I'm confident that his staff can master this difficult variation. 

I encourage all the Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei to come eat here, especially if you are from Hawaii. Every Japanese born in Hawaii I have spoken to have told me that SHOKU is one of the best Ramen-Yas on the mainland. There is something about the flavors here at SHOKU that make Hawaiians happy. I know that many of my Japanese-Hawaiian Yelp friends would love this place. 

Also, remember that this is a Kyushu style Ramen-Ya so it would be a travesty to order something that wasn't Tonkotsu. You don't go to a Sapporo Ramen house and not order the Miso. You don't got to a Tokyo Ramen house and not order the Shoyu. You don't go to a Chinese-Japanese Ramen house and not order the Tan Tan Men. And you defiantly should not go to a Hakata Ramen-Ya and not get the Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is the signature dish of Hakata, Kyushu.

Stayed here for work as we had a conference here. For starters, PH is very conveniently located. Finding the place if you're driving can be a pain, however - it took my boss 45 minutes just trying to figure out where to drive in for the lobby!

The lobby itself is not much to speak about -- hardly any place to sit, unless you think three very small benches is adequate. The check in staff were pleasant enough. Curbside staff were helpful. 

Room-wise, it is pretty dark. Unless you are staying in one of the suites -- we did have a party in one of those which had a fantastic view. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=QWK7FTtIHE2fSJWdJuTJ0A#QWK7FTtIHE2fSJWdJuTJ0A The pillows are uncomfortably high. If you don't like firm pillows, you should bring your own, or roll up some towels. There is a small coffee maker, no fridge, I had to call up a hairdryer, but overall apart from the loud revelers who thought yelling at 3:00 am is acceptable right outside someone's room, it was a quiet room on the 12th floor. 

Conference facilities are on the mezzanine level where the Chapel is. Lots of weddings going on while I was there. In general, the conference food was good. It is expensive though! I suppose that's the case with most hotels on The Strip. For instance, I had to order wine & cheese for a workshop I was putting on. Get this, a baked brie for 25 people runs about $225.00, not including tax & gratuity. Ouch. 

WiFi is not free -- I believe it is $15 a day per device? Didn't bother checking out the gym, also heard that is not free. Nothing is! 

Despite the downside, I liked it. I had stayed at Bally's before which was a bit of a blah experience for me. This was the opposite. Loved the crystal lighting throughout. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=dWu2esICZ8ToW3geJ6kXsA#dWu2esICZ8ToW3geJ6kXsA

You do have the convenience of the Miracle Mile shops which is nice - don't even have to set food outside! There is also a PF Chang's in the casino area and a Starbucks. The Miss America pageant was going on while I was there which made for an interesting scene! (The guys really liked seeing them for the swimsuit photo shoot at the pool.)

As a native Texan, I have a hard time even bringing myself to go to Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas - my palate is honed to Tex Mex, powerful salsas, reasonable prices...

I saw La Comida pop up and decided it would great to try a new place downtown that had what seemed like a relatively authentic menu and great location.  We made reservations for Saturday night and met our friends there - both of us securing rockstar parking (it was early for Saturday dinner) and a half-moon booth inside but right by the open patio.

One of our friends is Mexican and saw huarache on the menu, a childhood favorite.  We were given a mini galvanized tub of warm chips and salsa, which was plain - our friend asked the server in Spanish for the non-gringo salsa which got us a chile de arbol salsa, which was not much better.  Waters were served in mason jars which is cute.

The server did ask before we opened our menus if we wanted guacamole with our chips - my friend immediately agreed - to which we experienced dismay upon opening the menu and seeing it for $11 - and the $11 did not include a tableside guac in molcajete show - but instead a small side bowl that was not much bigger than the mini salsa container.  That was a disappointment - at least do it tableside to charge that much - what I can make for $2 with 2 avocados!

Our table's order was our friends' getting huarache and queso fundido, I ordered the ceviche trio, and Eric R. got the chicken enchiladas with mole.  He was pleased to hear it came with rice and beans.  When the food was delivered, the queso came with tortillas, and Eric got a small plate with his 2 enchiladas (topped with pickled onions), and I got a small plate (see pic) with 3 divided sections with ceviche.  My husband's sad face was attributed to the "communal" rice and beans, which he thought was bizarre since he was not sharing his with anyone.

The huarache had cheap meat, not like the kind our friend expected.  He was a bit disappointed.  Eric R.'s meal was cold - he had an enchilada then sent his plate and the communal beans and rice back to be reheated.  The kitchen was nice enough to give him 2 new enchiladas hot.  Of my 3 ceviches, the snapper one was tasteless (dry fish, pepper, and sliced green and red bell peppers) but the shrimp in a green sauce and the bay scallop with tropical fruit were very tasty.

Overall, it seemed just too expensive for small portions and food that was not memorable.  The only thing memorable is the rip-off guacamole that we were somewhat conned into ordering.  Our server was nice but it took awhile to get our check taken care of though it was not terribly busy at the early hour.  This place will definitely stay popular, so enjoy those $20 margaritas (not kidding) and $7 bottles of XX - no beers on tap.

I had just arrived at my friends place in Arizona and was hungry after the 5 1/2 hour drive.   My friend suggesting a few places to eat, but there are few options in Buckeye, AZ and Cracker Barrel is the only one that sounded good.   I'd heard of Cracker Barrel but never been, so this was my chance.

SERVICE:  Our server Deana was pretty awesome.  Very friendly, always with had smile and not far away if we needed anything, including a beverage refills we never had to ask for.   The food came out of the kitchen in a timely manner as well.

FOOD:  After looking over the large menu of southern comfort fixin's, I decided on the Fried Chicken Salad ($8.69), a side of Mac & cheese ($2.59) and a side of the "Hash brown casserole" ($2.59).   My friend ordered the chicken tender sandwich platter ($8.49).

My salad was good as salads go.   Crisp lettuce, crispy chicken tender pieces, grape tomatoes, cheese & croutons.   Simple, but tasty overall and really hit the spot!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#z6-H47IpF9u2nPk3QuEhIQ

Mac & cheese = ooey, gooey, creamy & cheesy.... Pretty tasty and more flavor than just melted Velveeta.

My friend said his open faced chicken sandwich (w/fried rather than grilled chicken) was very good, though he didn't eat any of the corn bread and apple butter that came with it.

Yelpers, If you don't read only one review this year, don't read this one; the service was bland, but so was the food - this review can't be much better.

Quick tip, Phoenix in the summer months is not ALWAYS hot, carry a light jacket or sweater in your car, sometimes it's coooold, brrrr. Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.

My first impression of the Elephant Bar was "What type of food do they serve here?" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.

I FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.

I ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.

The chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also. 

The bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress "are you really going to charge me for that meal?". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.

My wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong. Who knows, maybe they can. :-/

We came in during the first few days after they opened, so the staff was still working out some of the kinks. I won't fault them for that. They were all extremely friendly and helpful and there is always a bit of a learning curve for a new spot.

Despite the fact that the entire staff was still in the training stages, the food came out tasting great. Chef Marc was there helping the staff out and giving them pointers as they prepared our food and chatted us up while we waited. You really see how passionate he is for his business, which was important. 

Everyone in our party ordered the one topping pizza, salad and drink combo. My fella and I decided to share since we wanted to try out the dessert pizza. We opted for the spicy sauce and supprassota on top. It had a nice spicy kick and the crust was perfection. Even better than the one I had at their other location on Eastern. The salad was great as well. We opted for the Caesar and it had a nice subtle flavor and wasn't overly sauced, which I enjoyed. We ordered everything together and they offered to make our dessert pizza a little later so we could enjoy it when we were ready, so it was as fresh and warm as possible. The flavors were great and I really enjoyed this little treat. Not overly sweet and had a nice savory aspect that helped even out the powdered sugar and fruit topping. 

As much as I liked it, I would probably stick to their savory items next time since they offer Art of Flavors gelato as well and it's very hard to me to resist that when it's available.

I'm very excited by the newest addition to this complex and I see myself coming pretty often to indulge my pizza and gelato cravings.

Maggiano's can sometimes feel like an endless party. 

I remember working in the Sears Tower when we first heard that Chili's (Brinker Intl') had bought the rights to the concept. In short, we were all bummed and felt they would goof it up. 

Well so much for our misgiving's, they sold off Macaroni Grill and made a decent attempt at allowing a little bit of Chicago's Italian scene to come alive for the rest of the country. 

Now don't get me wrong, this restaurant isn't perfect, as they were this past Friday evening. Yes, the Hostess station still seems confused as Laura M noted in her review last year. But where can you get a good meal for two, including appetizers, drinks and dessert, along with two especially prepared take home entrees for $55?  Really!

So we started with a glass of Merlot ($8.00), Soup ($3.95)and a Sausage appetizer ($8.50 which was a meal in itself, see photos).  For out entrees, we had their Classic Pasta for $12.95 and Mama's Lasagna $14.95.  Both were very good, though the entrees came first and our server's boss was indifferent at best while being distracted with a larger party.  Our server Hannah was outstanding, but so much for our easy going, pre-Christmas romantic meal.

For dessert, we shared two of their petite samplers for $3.50 each and coffee.  Their Apple Cobbler and dark chocolate Truffle balls were delicious and worth the trip.  We highly recommend them.  The regular sized dessert are good, but way over the top in size.

The bill came to $66.16, less a $10.00 off coupon from their email list.  So if we stopped here, it would be a fair $55.37 and not a bad deal, right?  But Maggiano's was still offering their buy two, take two home special. Nice! So we had enough for a second dinner sometime this week.  All and all, a delicious option. 

Enjoy!

We have been to two Outbacks in the last ten years.

It's wasn't because the food was bad; it was just that the experience wasn't anything special.  

We tried the Happy Hour once up at Mayo Boulevard location and left underwhelmed. Recently however we received two gift cards and decided to give them another try.  

Outback has always reminded me of a slightly more upscale Sizzler, mainly because prices are so low.

Last night the three of us started off with Spinach Artichoke Dip for $7.99, Blooming Onions for $7.29 and the Coconut Shrimp for $7.99.  All these were pretty good, though the star was the Coconut Shrimp.  It was served with an orange marmalade/stone mustard sauce which was interesting, but we had to ask for some cocktail sauce in the end. The Blooming Onions on the other hand are still way too greasy for me and clearly they need to rethink this offering.

For our meal, we tried to order the Pork Chops.  But strangely, they had run out (?) this, so we had to substituted for the 1/2 order of Baby Back Ribs ($13.49). They were very good and had a nice smoky taste.  

We also ordered the Filet with Shrimp for $15.99.  We ordered it medium rare and it came out with a pink center and very tender. But as Yelp'er Jody K pointed out in her review -- the shrimp were tiny and way too salty, with some sort of Cajun/blacken seasoning just dropped on top.

Our last dinner item was actually their Short Ribs Nacho appetizer for $6.99.  It had a nice taste and must be considered an incredible value.

So our tab came to $74.60, including a diet soft drink, a nice Chteau St Michelle Riesling, and one of their special Black Sangria. This also included a discount of 50% off one entree that we found on-line as we waited for our drinks to arrive. LOL

Me: Is that half a dead rat sewn to half a dead pigeon?
Mr Arm: Yes.

Me: Oh. Then what's in the jar next to rat-bird?
Mr Arm: That's 3/4 of a dead dove sewn to 1/4 of a deceased shark and that over there is a German Shepard penis.
Me: Neat-O. 

Mr Arm: Can you guess what's in that jar?
Me: A cat sewn to a bat? 
Mr Arm: You're half right.
Me: A bat-bird? 
Mr Arm: Getting colder...
Me: bat-bunny?
Mr Arm: Colder
Me: **squinting eyes to decipher the remains floating in the jar of embalming booze**
Mr Arm: It's a cat. Just a cat. No hybrid here, the hair's just gone.
Me: I see.  

**These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**

First off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by. 

All my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM. 

The Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor. 

Among the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some. 
- Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox
- An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod
- A cat on a hat
- Legos
- Colon photos
- 100+ year old stuffed fox
- Old electro-shock machine
- Jar of human teeth
- Jar of human skin flakes
- Jar of human finger and toe nails
- Tentacles
- A family of amphibians
- A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five
- Steampunk bears
- Bindle stick bundles
- A gerbil named 'poop'
- Ray guns
- Gimp-type masks
- Original Addams family goodies
- Carnival treasures
- Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse
- I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats
- And soooo much more...

When you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.

When somebody writes about a laundromat and says, "I love this place" and "This is the Cadillac of laundromats", then that is the kind of laundromat for me!  

My stupid washer decided to crap out on the Sunday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so by the time I bought a new washing machine I had to wait 10days to get my washer delivered!! Boo!  Of course I had been out of town three times in the last three weeks so I had a monstrous load of laundry and my dog was sick so I had some nasty smelling towels, so I decided I just needed to suck it up and venture to a laundromat.  After lots of Yelp searches, review reading and phone calls to laundromats I decided on Eco Laundry.  My research paid off!  

Eco Laundry has lots of washers with multiple capacities:  

1load washer- $1.25
2 load washer- $2.50
3 load washer- $3.75
5load washer- $4.50
6load washer- $6.00

They are all arranged in a very organized fashion with large signs to help you find what you are looking for.  

They also have two sizes of driers: 

Standard load dryer:  $0.25 for 8minutes I believe
50lb load commercial drier: $0.50 for initial 4minutes and I think $0.25 for every additional 4 after it starts.

Since I was making the trek to the laundromat, I decided to do my comforter and all my dog's blankets and stuff.  I had around 10-12 loads that I washed and dried for about $30 in 2hours!  Honestly the most pain in the butt part of it was unloading it and putting it all away when I made it home!

As far as the interior goes it was as pleasant as a laundromat could be.  Brightly lit room with Flat screen TVs throughout, clocks on the walls, stocked up vending machine, soap machine, and coin dispenser.  Oh and FREE wifi!  The cleanliness was far superior than any other laundromat I have been in.  The bathroom is kept locked, which I assume is for cleanliness and anti-loitering reasons, but you can easily ask the attendant for the key. Speaking of the attendants, they have great customer service!  When I called and while I was there, the attendants were very informative and pleasant.  The clientele was a combo of college students, a few couples and some randoms doing larger household items like comforters.  I ended up meeting a very pleasant couple from NYC and we chatted while we handled our laundry.  All around I have absolutely no complaints.  If I ever need a laundromat  in the valley of the sun, Eco Laundry will forever be my spot!   

Oh and make sure to bring cash!  All machines operate on quarters only.

This place has been here for EVERRRR It's behind the Big O Tires in the same parking lot as a bunch of car shops. This was the original "Raider" bar of N. PHX. for over 10 years I guess its under new ownership now and the new owner ousted the Raider Club. Ouch this place used to be packed!! I haven't been here in awhile, well since I had a kegerator and with these bad times I found myself here again last night for a bit while the Fiesta Bowl was on. You would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty. It was about 8-ish and the bar was quite bare with only a handful of patrons sitting at the bar possibly just for the barbie bartender behind the counter in a tight corset. It was just my brother and I but we didnt get greeted upon entering or feel welcome so much. They only had Bud, Bud Light and Amber Bock on tap and what looked like a decent selection of bottled beer. The staff wasn't overly friendly or attentive to us with my brother practically having to beg to buy another round.

The atmosphere was just pretty blah all around. The projection screen looks to be the same old one and is in dyer need of being replaced. The flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it. One more good note looks like they put in a smoking patio that seems new and some fresh paint outside to green and white. Used to be Silver & Black I guess this place really wants to set itself apart from those crazy Raider fans. 

I didnt make it upstairs  to have a look around (they used to have pool tables) but most of the furniture looked to be the same nothing special or new. This used to be such a great place full of energy and happy people. We left feeling neglected and spent the rest of our money on scratcher tickets at the liquor store where they like us. I don't want to believe this bar is THAT bad so I plan on returning on a busier night, to give it another go and hopefully update with more stars??

I know this review will mainly appeal to vegetarians but don't ignore it all you non-vegetarians!  Consider a veg restaurant part of your adventurous Yelp eating!  Is fake chicken really that different from cow guts?  Well yes, but..... what I'm saying is: don't be afraid to try it!

Chinatown isn't exactly the easiest place for vegetarians to visit - a menu can be daunting enough as it is, but then to throw in the question "is there any (chicken stock/fish sauce/bonito flakes/meat bits) in this dish?" and be prepared to blow some minds, including your own.  I don't enjoy blowing minds so sadly I don't visit many places in Chinatown.

But hey!  Don't fret, vegetable lovers!  Veggie House is awesome and will fill your Asian-food cravings.  They have a huge menu which always throws me for a loop (I'm not used to so many choices!) and everything they offer is vegan.

The first time I visited Veggie House, I made the mistake of trying to be healthy and ordered an all-veggie stir fry dish.  It wasn't bad, but I've come to find out that they specialize in fake meats.  Now, I've been a vegetarian for over six years so I'm not the best person to ask on how much the fake meats taste like the real deal but I'm going to go ahead and guess "not very."  I also want to say that I don't care because I find the food here delicious.

Things I've had that are really great: General Tso's chicken, crispy beef, orange beef, sizzling chicken (think an Asian version of fajitas), and curry roti.

Things I've had that are skippable: vegetable soup, spring rolls, the happy sushi roll (way too much of a fishy taste for me, but my husband liked it).

Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and large.  My only complaint is that I wish the items were a dollar or two cheaper so that I could feel better about ordering a third item to share with my husband instead of the usual two (yes, I'm a pig).  But fake meats can be pricey so I understand.

A restaurant that has an entire menu I can order from!  Take that, Chinatown!

Why the heck did it take me so long to come here?  Forte was great!  Being open until 3am is a big plus.  Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)

The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.

We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the "Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.

Our favorite dish was the "Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :P

The "Thracian Clay Pot" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in "Game of Thrones" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the "Bulgarian Mixed Grill" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha 

We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.

Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!

Maybe it's been a while since I last stepped foot into a Carrabba's or something but this place makes me, a 5'0" gal, feel like a giant.  

After being given our beeper/pager/thingie for our table [10-15min wait at 7PM on a busy Saturday night], I managed to get the top of my riding boot caught in the stupid bench twice and bump my head on the trim of the window.  Is this how you normal height people feel?  Anyways, more boot-catching-on-seats-action followed as we were seated in the tiniest booth ever.  I was sitting on one side with my gal friend, who's about the same height and weight as me, while my brother had the other side for himself.  During the whole meal, we were bumping into each other and it's hard to imagine how two people can sit on one side of a booth comfortably.  It's a surprise how I even ate when I was curled up against her the whole time!

Anyways, while I seldom review bigger chain restaurants, I really just wanted to say that Carrabba's has delicious food but I think their portions shrank... A LOT.  I had my fill of warm toasty bread with herbs and olive oil, a nice steamy bowl of sausage and lentils soup, and then had the tiniest plate of shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka.  I'm not a big eater by any means but I somehow found myself in front of an empty plate with a hungry tummy.    It tasted amazing, so much more than my brother's lobster mac and cheese and my friend's champagne shrimp and scallop linguine, but it was ridiculously small.

I know I look pretty young but seriously, it was like a kid's sized meal and considering that I was carded when I ordered my Limoncello and Prosecco drink, which tasted more like cranberry juice than anything, I'm definitely an adult.  $23/pp including tip for three entrees, one alcoholic beverage, and a lemonade.  Not sure I'd be back even though they have decent flavor.  Pity... I do love their sausage and lentil soup!

While other restaurants market themselves as being different, Bazaar Meat delivers the goods. With a massive menu -- physically heavier than most and with more variety of items than other steakhouses -- this place really is unique. As soon as I learned their opening date I snagged reservations for our party of four. I'm typically weary of new restaurants, but as a fan of Jose Andres I had to give it a shot.

From beginning to end our meal was outstanding. To start, a dozen oysters ($34) -- six medium sized, briny and meaty Paradise oysters and six small, more mild Kusshi oysters. There are four types of tartares on the menu. The classic ($24) is prepared tableside and served with parker house rolls. Don't be afraid to make yourself a steak tartare slider, I did and it was fantastic.

The list of starters is where Andres' influence is most evident with items like cotton candy foie gras, tacos, chicharron, and croquetas. The dish that jumped out at me, though, was the s'mores ($30). Four to an order. Each with wafer thin graham crackers sandwiching slivers of chocolate, velvety smooth and rich foie, and torched and blistered hunks of marshmallow. Try to stay composed after eating one. It's impossible. They're so good you'll be banging the table or letting some expletives fly out of shear amazement. They are sweet, so next time I might consider getting them as a dessert.

Side dishes are delicious as well. Andres takes a playful jab at Joel Robuchon's pomme puree with his own rendition of mashed potatoes ($15) with a menu description that reads, "butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes." On the lighter side are the Brussels sprouts petals ($12), served with grapes, apricots, lemon air, and lemon puree. My favorite side was the baby corn ($13). Grilled and topped with mayo, chile piquin, and popcorn powder it's the perfect combo of heat and sweetness.

Our group shared the Spanish-style bone-in rib eye ($80/lb) from Washugyu Ranch, Oregon. It's cooked on their Josper grill (part oven, part grill. Google it. I had to and it looks cool.) using charcoal and grape leaves, giving it plenty of smokiness. It isn't cheap at $80 a pound. Our steak came in at 3.13 pounds, which equals an empty wallet at the end of the night. But, it's one of the best I've had in town. 

Desserts are on the small side. They're about the size of single serving buffet desserts.  We ordered ten ($25) consisting of five different types served in a cute bakery-style box. The order: dark chocolate and olive oil cream puff; dark chocolate and aged rum cake; caramelized puff pastry with bacon, strawberries and cream; milk chocolate peanut, and caramel tart; and caramelized puff pastry with chocolate, caramel and sea salt. All were great, particularly the dark chocolate cake and the bacon and strawberry puff pastry.

Service was exceptional all night. Our server (formerly of L'Atelier) and busser offered great recommendations and checked in frequently to make sure all of our needs were met. The only negative is that their dessert menu didn't list all ingredients for the dishes. My friend, who has a nut allergy, reacted to hazelnuts in the dark chocolate and aged rum cake forcing her to rush home after dinner for allergy medicine. Luckily, she was fine and we had a fantastic meal. Bazaar Meat might be the new kid on the block, but in my book they're already one of the top three steak houses in Vegas.

You might be at the Paris Hotel or in Paris, France
You might like to gamble, you might like to dance
But no matter which Paris you are in, when you go to a cafe
You want both good service and food, you don't want it any other way

Wifey and I walked into this cafe after a showing of Jersey Boys
All three workers there from the get-go were immature without poise
Customers didn't know where to order, so there were all these different lines
One girl scolded each customer if the right place to order he didn't find.

Wait staff, just serve somebody, don't scold us 'cause the order place isn't clear
Stop talkin' and just serve somebody
Don't embarrass us in a way the whole store can hear!
Stop complainin' and just serve somebody.

So the girls scolded and helped the customers in a random mish-mash way
Some people who came later got helped before because the right line they did stay
Eventually we ended up getting our fancy dessert food.
Let me tell you, the gelato was OK, but the chocolate mousse cake was good!

The mousse cake had rich chocolate flavor with hints of pistachio
The gelato had bursts of fresh tropical tasting mango
We asked for water, but the girls all said, we don't give out tap water here
If you want, you can buy the bottled water, but none for free, is that clear?

Wait staff, just serve somebody, and please a little courtesy show
Stop talkin' and just serve somebody
Change girl, please don't talk for three minutes while the line behind us does grow
Stop chattin' it up and serve somebody.

While we savored our sumptuous splendorous sweets
One girl is scolding another, telling what she did wrong
I'm not here to hear about your problems
We ate quickly, stayed not for long.

If we ever go back to the Paris Hotel, I must get that dessert again
But I'll get it to go, unless the servers are trained to be cordial women and men.

"Mehhh" has never described a restaurant quite as well as it does Carly's. 

They can't seem to be able to land on a particular theme with the menu. I'm not real sure what you would categorize them as. Are they supposed to be wine bar, Mexican, Mediterranean, or bistro cafe; maybe you can decide? Find menu items like tomato bisque, quesadilla, cheese platters, olive plates, hummus, salads, gyros, barbeque sandwich, meatball sub, smoked salmon, figs and presciutto, buffalo chicken, and flat bread pizza's.

I enjoy the ambiance of that downtown charm you can find at most every food spot on Roosevelt Row. Nice service with a friendly smile, an 'average' wait time between ordering and the arrival of food, and a large selection of beer and wine; although I didn't partake in these. It was lunch time after all. 

I went with the Southwest Chicken, but was looking for something with some added kick that day. I asked them to spice it up with some jalapenos, but they only had green chili - so I went with it. The sandwich itself was A-OK, but nothing really to write home about. Mom if you're reading this, I really wasn't intending on writing home - so stop reading. ;-)

When the bill arrived, I was completely surprised to find they charged me an added $1 for the meager addition of green chili to an already $10 sandwich, making my total out the door with tax and tip close to $14. I cannot, in good faith, suggest anyone to come here with preference over another, I will let you reserve judgement for yourself should you decide to patronize. In my opinion the sandwich was way over priced at $14. Maybe I wouldn't have been so critical if my lunch was under $10 :-/

Happy yelping Phoenix!

Being one of very few spots that seems to cater to people who want to eat a salad; with the competition being places like Whole Foods and AJ's salad bars, you've got to give this place their just desserts. (hah, if only I could just get desserts right now, that would be awesome.)

I'm kind of glad I didn't review this place my first time through a year or so ago. I didn't quite put together the tastiest of salads that time through, but I decided I'd give them another try, I have been watching my figure the last few weeks and this was just the type of spot I wanted for lunch. I threw together a salad with spinach and mixed greens, popped on some jalepenos, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, sun dried tomatos, grilled chicken and topped (lightly) with their house dressing. My combination of veggies and dressing was good this time around and everything tasted fresh, just the way a salad should. No pre made mixtures sitting all day here.

Not exactly a build it yourself, but you tell em what you want, they throw it together, then they toss your salad and away you go. They've got some tasty (looking, all I was here for was a salad) Mediterranean food available too, dolma, falafel, etc. I was feening for some of that delicious looking grilled (or fried, not sure exactly) cauliflower, but I stuck to just a salad this time around. Oh grilled cauliflower, you will be mine, oh yes, you will be mine. I guess I'll have to update my review after I finally come back around for you.

They had a smoothie bar there too; I didn't partake, with a bunch of fresh fruits and juices at their disposal. I imagine it's kinda hard to mess up a smoothly too badly.

They're located in the ASU downtown campus building at Fillmore and Central avenue; no need to enter the building, find em on the Central ave side. Parking isn't terrible for those of you who are driving down here. Find a metered spot, spend the $1.50 for the hour and enjoy your lunch. Hey, these meters accept cards now!

Happy Yelping Phoenix, enjoy your freshly tossed salad ;-)

BEST OMAKASE EVER ! Thanks to Chef Eric for accommodating us for so long (oh my god it took FOUR AND A HALF HOURS) ! ! ! First and BEST omakase experience ! Omakase is a show in itself. Watching Chef Eric work his magic and show his creativity in his dishes. max points on service ! 

Fresh Wasabi - made into a relish. Addicting! went well with a lot of dishes but also yummy to "snack" on while waiting in between dishes. produces a fast effect to the nasal passages. has a nice, sweet flavor. 

#1 - Marinated Tuna on top of chopped Mountain Yam with Wasabi Tobiko

Saw Chef Eric chopping mountain yam. After chopping, the yam produced a "slimy" texture, similar to okra but crunchy like jicama. Yam itself was plain but paired with a marinated tuna balanced flavors very well. what a variety of textures

#2 - Deep Fried Gobo/Burdock Root with dipping sauce

Little chips. Fried perfectly. Very slight starchy texture but crispy overall. Lightly sweet. Great "snack" ! 

#3 - Fresh Santa Barbara Sea Conch with salt/pepper/sesame oil dipping sauce

Very fresh. Meat texture had a nice "bite" texture. LIGHTLY dipping the sliced conch in the sauce gives it a nice flavor. Salt helps brings out more sweetness of the conch meat

#4 - Fresh Hama Hama & Shigoku Oysters

One of my fears on eating raw oysters is they being not fresh, and not clean (resulting in biting into sand/shell/etc.) Two different sizes. Shigoku oysters were small and fat. Very clean and fresh. Gave a nice, creamy texture. Hama Hama oysters were much bigger, not as "fat/thick". Outer "rim" of the oyster, gave it a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture when eating. 

#5 - Fresh Live Scallop w/ Dried Miso

Served two ways. The scallop itself was thinly sliced and sprinkled with dried miso and layered with slices of cucumber. The miso gave it a nice flavor on top of the fresh taste of the scallop. The muscle? was sliced and placed in the middle. Not chewy but gave a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture, similar to what you'd get from eating fresh geoduck sashimi 

#6 - Takoyaki - Deep Fried Fresh Octopus Suction Cups

At first, i thought this was calamari. But was told it was the SUCTION CUPS of an octopus leg. Lightly battered and deep fried. Crispy batter. Suction cups itself was nice and "crispy" 

#7 - Fresh Live Hokkaido Octopus Leg

This was definitely a surprise. Aside it from having a small spot of sriracha sauce on top that gave it a little kick... i did NOT expect the octopus to be so soft and tender. Granted i dont think i've had raw octopus, especially served like this but oh man ! 

#8 - Fresh Live Sweet Shrimp with Black Tobiko and Uni + Deep Fried Head

The head was deep fried. Fried pretty well. Most of it was edible, except some thicker, harder areas. The sweet shrimp itself was big. Meat texture was firm. Slightly naturally sweet. 

#9 - Fresh Live Santa Barbara Sea Urchin topped with a raw Quail Egg & Ikura on a bed of mixed seaweed brown rice

LARGE & FAT (no joke !) pieces of sea urchin placed on top of the bed of mixed seaweed with brown rice (and other things) with a raw quail egg on top with some Ikura. The sea urchin was SUPER creamy. Mixing in the quail egg and ikura. Taking a small piece of the sea urchin and everything else. What a orchestra of flavors and textures. so delicious ! add a little fresh wasabi for even better experience !  i think this is less than $20 ala carte too ! what a deal, even normally ! 

#10 - Fresh Blue Fin Tuna/Chu-Toro/O-toro from Spain Nigiri Trio 

Made into nigiri. Chef used his special homemade soy sauce on the tuna as well ! Best blue fin tuna i've ever eaten. Very slight metallic taste. Super tender and flavorful. Chu-toro was a perfect balance of meat and fat. Melts in your mouth. O-toro (was a little disappointing due to the pieces of chewy parts (tendons?) which req' the chef to slice and arrange it differently). Super fatty. Would have liked the chef to quickly torch the top to bring out the aroma and flavor of the fat even more. 

#11 - Fresh Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna with Fried Onions

Sliced tuna. Add a few onions to the middle, on top of the sliced chili, wrap it around and enjoy. plethora of flavors on top of the nice sauce it was sitting in. Chili adds a little small kick to it all

#12 - Torch Seared Wagyu Beef with Uni, Ikura, and chopped Shallots

Super tender! Roll it around to "encase" the uni and ikura. Opposite side of beef still raw. variation of beef tataki. 

#13 - Fresh Kohada (Spotted Sardine) 

First time trying kohada ! always wanted to try ! strong flavor with a little sourness (similar to mackerel) 

#14 - Fresh Australian Ocean Trout and New Zealand King Salmon

Trout tastes crisper, less fatty than salmon. Both orange meat. Simple and clean. 

#15 - Fresh Blue Fin O-Toro Sashimi

THAT MARBLING ! Super tender. A5 Wagyu of the Sea. 

#16 - Unagi topped with avocado and bonito flakes

Simple but delicious unagi nigiri

#17 - Green Tea Ice Cream

1st floral tasting and aromatic green tea EVER

It's a step above Denny's, for sure. Bonus points for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week because clearly, you'll need food after that long night of debauchery.

I had the the Buffalo chicken sammich fashioned after an order of what else but buffalo wings, duh. Pulling an all-nighter and being in desperate need of refueling, of COURSE that's the item that stood out to me. I wasn't really expecting much as the place even resembles a Denny's, but all in all, I was surprisingly pleased. No small piece of rubbery chicken doused in some ranch-like goo made it's way to the table. Instead, I received a hefty patty of crisp, hot sauced chix, sprinkled with a good amount of blue cheese crumbles. Not fine dining by any means, but it certainly hit the spot. It was a decent size too. I only finished half and took the rest back to the hotel before heading straight back out for more trouble-brewing.... but that's another conversation entirely.

A few cons:

- $15 is on the pricey side for a meal that probably shouldn't cost more than 10 bucks elsewhere. It *IS* Vegas, though. I suppose that's to be expected.

- SERVICE. Damn. The guy was nice when he was around, but we barely saw him outside of taking our orders and when he brought the check. I understand we're eating at 4am, but this place is supposed to be fully operational 24 hours a day. Why oh WHY did it take 30+ minutes to get our food? And if we didn't ask another server to check on our orders, I wonder how much longer we would have waited.

Anyway, I'd eat here again if it was a convenience issue (which it was), but probably not by choice because of the whole when-in-Vegas-eat-GREAT-not-good thing... Actually, on second thought, I take that back. I'll probably be back out of necessity. Thems dining options are slim to none at the crack of dawn. 

Mmmmk, I'll stop rambling now.

Meeting a friend who was visiting from out of town, our party of 5 (plus infant) decided to meet at Ramen Sora for dinner. We got there, but they were packed to the gills, so we decided to head to Wendy's Noodle House instead, since our friend had a plane to catch and didn't want to waste our time waiting for a table. I remember coming here years ago when they first opened. I enjoyed my meal here that time, but haven't been back since. 

We were seated quickly and the service was pretty hospitable. They came to take our orders pretty quickly despite sending them away several times because we were chatting so much we were too distracted to actually pick something to eat from the littany of menu options. Our table started with some xiao long bao and steak baos for appetizers. I didn't get a chance to try either of these, but my friends raved about them. I ordered a Thai tea with boba and the noodles in xo sauce. The food came out quickly and and everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My noodles were nice and spicy and had a great texture. There wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't enjoy. 

There are many things to love about this place. The prices were beyond reasonable, their menu selection is extensive and everything we ordered was tasty. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of the noodle soups and desserts on the menu. Great little spot I'm glad I rediscovered.

Before anything else, let me just state that I hate driving to downtown LV because I have no patience to parallel park my yacht, I'm too cheap to pay for parking and there's always some crazy/drunk person crossing the street when they're not supposed to tempting me to run them over.    

/endrant

I read on a review to park in DT garage 3 - well, I didn't do that. You can also parallel park in front of the restaurant or across the street - I didn't do that either. I parked at Binion's which is a short walk from Pizza Rock. I was told that the DT garage is a mess anyway. I had no clue where I needed to walk after parking my car so I followed a showgirl wearing sparkly stuff and feathers. She was walking towards the opposite direction - I was late for dinner but I got pics of her nice cheeks!

/endshenanigans

The place is filled with TV's so you can watch sports. There's a big rig coming out of the wall. Sheet metal with a heart, spade, club, diamond cut out on the ceiling. I got a Chimay...3/4 of it since 1/4 of it ended up on the table when it was put in front of me. They were giving me a grapefruit drink which I apparently ordered and not a Chimay. I hate grapefruit so let me go ahead and order me a grapefruit drink because that makes sense!

I was looking forward to trying their truffle fries/ rosemary garlic fries and Cal Italia pizza. So we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza. Kacey informed us that this is the same as Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. She was right. Same menu and everything. We were debating whether or no we should get a Sicilian pizza but it's $30...for a pizza? What?

Truffle Fries:
Fries were crispy inside and out. Truffle flavor was not noticeable. They drizzled a little bit of truffle oil, I only saw a few tiny specks of black truffles on these fries. Flavor was definitely lacking. 2/5

Rosemary Garlic Fries:
The rosemary taste was strong. I was hoping for more garlic flavor instead of GROSSmary. 2.5/5

Meatballs:
6 tender smelly balls. Smelly because of the cheese probably. They were ok. 3.5/5

Margherita Pizza:
Great crisp chewy crust. Real tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil. A pizza for the purists. 4/5

Cal italia:
Mario and Luigi did not approve of the Cal Italia. This California-inspired pizza was a Food Network Gold Medal winner if it matters to anyone. It has gorgonzola, asiago, mozzarella, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmiggiano-Reggiano and balsamic reduction. Sweet and salty...not for the purists. I enjoyed this bastardized pizza. 5/5

We got a 20% discount for being locals. Their happy hour starts at 10pm and some menu items go for $3, $5 and $7. Service was not the best but it wasn't horrible. Pizzas were good but skip the fries. So, overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.

Shortly after posting my review, I got a message from one of the owners and he said:

"Would like to send you some additional info on Pizza Rock:
- Free valet parking is available for Pizza Rock directly across the street at the Downtown Grand casino.
- The Sicilian pizza is a large format pizza and generally serves 3 people, hence the $30 price tag."

So there! Now you know.

Slickably good!  

I went here based on the photos of the ice cream sandwich.  So, if you're perusing reviews and taking a look at pics....... well....... In this case, a picture truly is worth a thousand tastes.  

In a single word...  FANTASTIC  Homemade cookies.  Ice cream made in house!  cute little shop on a popular corner in Tempe.  You can't get any better, but if you could, Slicables is where you'd look.

I went with about 3 other friends one day after having dinner nearby in Tempe.  We wanted ice cream.  We.  Needed.  Ice.  Cream!  Everyone turns to me to figure out where to go.  I turn to my trusty Yelp App and discover a highly rated ice cream shop less than a mile from where we were.  So, we park on Mill Ave.  (I add this part for those who might end up making the same mistake.)  Unfortunately, we went to an ice cream shop across the street by mistake.  Watch out, that area along Mill Ave can be confusing (especially after a few glasses of wine at dinner), so be sure to use the address.  That "other" shop doesn't have the ice cream sandwich.  So, we leave that shop and cross the street and hit up the correct location.

I had a nice simple sandwich, a scoop of delicious creamy vanilla ice cream between 2 delicately sweet and chewy chocolate chip cookies.  I was more than satisfied.  I licked the sweet ice cream in the middle of the cookies and then I finally took a hefty bite of the sandwich and I was sold.  

My friends had various combinations of mint and chocolate and other cookies.  They were super happy with their sweet sandwich-loves.

Being sandwiched in the middle of Tempe at Slickables is the right thing to do.  Go lick that creamy middle and thank me later!

The Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas remains one of the most beautiful hotels on the Strip. If at all possible try to stay in the main building (instead of the Spa Tower) and upgrade to a room with a view of the lake and fountains.

The glass flower ceiling in the lobby is still stunning while the Conservatory and Botanical Gardens just to the side of the lobby are a popular photo-op spot with seasonal displays. The current French Summer scene is as beautiful as any I've seen although my favorite may be the creative Chinese New Year gardens in January and February each year.

The Bellagio has received the AAA Five Diamond Award every year since 2000 for a reason. It is a great hotel. Elegant rooms and wonderful housekeeping make your experience in your room enjoyable. Meanwhile restaurants like Le Cirque, Picasso, Jasmine, and Jean Philippe Patisserie make dining a delight. The Bellagio Buffet is outstanding, but made even better on Friday, Saturday, or holidays thanks to King Crab Legs and Kobe-style Beef.

Shopping at the Bellagio may be out of the price range of most of us, but it's still delicious to browse the Hermes, Omega, Chanel, Fendi, Dior, Armani, Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany shops. 

For entertainment, my favorite Vegas show is at the Bellagio. Tickets are expensive, but the water-themed Cirque du Soleil masterpiece "O" is worth every bit of the cost. Don't want to spend too much money, then hang out at one of the Bellagio pools. Finally, plan to spend some time being mesmerized in the evenings by music, lights, and dancing water of the Fountains of Bellagio.

My only real disappointment with the Bellagio is the Casino. The number of tables seems limited, however, the real problem is a continual sour attitude of the dealers. I played a couple days at a variety of tables (mostly blackjack and roulette) and didn't meet even one friendly dealer that even pretended to like their job. Not sure if it was a bad week, but the negative vibe was noticeable compared to other casinos hit during the past week.

Despite the sourpuss dealers, the Bellagio is a dynamic 4-star plus experience. Bring money and a positive attitude for a vacation to remember.

The Barrymore...

What can I possible say about The Barrymore that hasn't been stated in a review already? 

Yes, it's off the strip and attached to the Royal Resort
Yes, it's small and intimate.
Yes, they have good steaks and lobster mac.
And Yes, The Barrymore is a great place to take a date or celebrate a special evening. 

My girlfriend and I chose The Barrymore to celebrate our one year together. We wanted to go somewhere that was good, intimate enough for some quality time, and a place that we haven't been to.  The Barrymore fit just right.  We had reservations, which really wasn't needed since we were the only ones here when we started our dinner.  Our server was fantastic.  Our server made it a point to give full descriptions of everything on their menu, especially their steaks. He even brought out a raw steak just to show us the size of it before it was cooked. I had my eye on their Filet Mignon since I learned about the Barrymore, but ended up with their bone-in-filet.  My dish was pretty good. I'm not saying it was the best steak I've had, but it definitely wasn't the worse. It was still tasty, tender, and my portion was huge. I only regret that I didn't stick with the filet mignon, which in my opinion, tends to have more flavor.  Regardless, I was still satisfied with my meal. My girlfriend was satisfied with her meal as well, but thought that their lobster mac was missing something. We just couldn't figure out what.  

Overall, I would suggest The Barrymore to anyone looking for an intimate dinner, a good steak, and great service. 

PS:  Can't forget about their bread basket.  One word....delicious!!

Saw the groupon, read reviews on yelp (all good) before I purchased it. My sister was coming into town and decided to get a haircut with me. I made an appointment for both of us on a Saturday at 3:30pm. I was told two different ladies were doing our hair. Perfect!

About a week before I received a phone call asking if they could move my sisters appointment to 12:30, I informed them that they we were both getting a haircut and that her flight didn't get in until 1pm. They said that was fine and it was left as is.

I received a call day of appointment and was told that Paul was no longer with the salon. They said they will try to get someone else to do my hair, in which they called back and said someone was available to do it at 3:30.

So we go to the salon and was greeted by the receptionist. She asked who was cutting our hair and we responded with "we have no idea, it's been changed a couple of times." Then it took her about 10 mins to figure out who was cutting our hair. My sisters stylist came up to the recceptionist 3 times to ask her if my sister was her client. The stylist was almost going to leave!

My sister was then greeted by her hair dresser and was taken to the back for her shampoo and deep conditioning. I was greeted by an assistant who said she will be washing and deep conditioning my hair while my stylist finishes up someone else.

So my sister has her wash and deep conditioning rather quickly. I was in the middle of my deep condition drying (30 mins) when my sister was already done with her haircut and styled. There was Wendy's trash all over the tables in what I assume is the stylists "breakroom," that is out in the open.

So I finally sit down with the stylist, Chirin (sp? younger lady with dark hair),  and she seemed a little frazzled. Her consultation was non-existent and when I told her what I wanted, she turned it into "just a trim." Uh okay, I guess. I wanted to discuss options with her but she cut me off and assumed I just wanted a trim. The hair cut took about 7 mins total. She then said that the assistant was going to take me again, dry my hair and straighten it. Then I was going to come back to her to frame my face with my hair dry. So far it's been about 45 mins.

The assistant (who was younger and learning about cosmetology--but very helpful and nice) took a good amount of time to dry and straighten my hair. About half way through the straighten I told her she needs to move it along, as I have been at the salon for about an hour and 15 mins, and still wasn't close to being done.

In the meantime, Chirin took another customer and was doing highlights on her head. Now I am not sure if the assistant was taking her time to make more time for the Chirin or what, but I knew I wasn't going to get back to the stylist until she was done doing highlights on this person. So it would have been more time. At that point, it was pushing almost two hours and I told the assistant and stylist I had to leave, since I had out of town guests waiting for me. I left both of them a small tip (as I spent more time with the assistant than the actual stylist).  Chirin told me "sorry."  I am sitting here typing this review with a half of a haircut. 

When I was getting my hair dried, I overheard that my stylist had two other people waiting for her! She had 4 people at once. Obviously, there is a booking problem with this salon. When I get a haircut, I want to relax and not feel rushed by the stylist, I did here. I didn't even get a full haircut in almost two hours!

After we left, my sister mentioned overhearing stylists talking about groupon customers and how some stylists do not want to take them because they do not get the money, but money off their booth rental from the owner. VERY inappropriate to talk about when groupon customers are sitting right there!!!

Overall, I was excited to spend time with my sister and get pampered. The only pampering I got was from the assistant. I am upset that I spent money on a groupon , received a half of a haircut, felt rushed, and it took up a lot of my time.  Guess I'll have to go back to my usual salon and get the rest of the haircut.

The last place we went to before leaving Vegas was First... and yes, we ended up saving the best for last! If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.

It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. 

Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. 

For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. 

The awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.

This place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!

So me and the Mr have been in Puerto Vallarta for the last week having a wonderful vacation! We ate and drank and drank and of course, drank some more. One of the waiters in PV recommended to us that we try this place as soon as we get back, small world eh?

Getting back we tried Huauchinango as soon as we could, within 24 hours! This place is crazy.. after walking in the door we immediately felt like we were back in PV! Some sort of Latin wormhole opened up and transported us right back to Mexico! Oh how I love Latins and wormholes! We were of course the only white guys in the place, well so we thought. We were immediately greeted by a very nice looking white guy.. sweet! He was quick to explain the menu to us as its mostly in Spanish but you can figure it out pretty quickly on your own. Of course me and the Mr went to town!! 2 tacos al pastor, quesadillas, 1 carna asada burrito and a chicken/cheese tamale. 

All I can say is.. oh, fuck yeah! This place is the real deal! The food is all made from scratch and in house. All the food we ordered was fucking great! The quesadillas were made from masa, stuffed with cheese and chicken then grilled and covered with green sauce, lettuce and cotija cheese. Hot, melty, slightly salty, tender, melt in your mouth good! 

The tacos al pastor were just like we had in PV! They have a vertical spit loaded with layered pork roast and a pineapple.. all slow roasted to perfection! All that piled onto 2 hot fresh corn tortillas.. divine!! 

Tamale was perfectly made, tender, non greasy with just the right amount of chili's, chicken and cheese.. here we go again, fuck yeah! 

Finally the carne asada burrito.. this thing is HUGE! Loaded with tender beef, beans and rice.. was a real gutbuster! Also house made are 4 different salsa's.. red, 2 greens and a habanero salsa that I'm going to feel around the ol' choco starfish manyana! All had wonderful flavors but one of the greens was my fav, I think it was a creamed avocado salsa.. super smooth, kind of spicy and very flavorful! 

All of this for 18 bucks!! 

I know I should keep my mouth shut and make this my secret Mexican place but let me tell you, food this good should never be a secret!!

Comer con gusto!

When we got home from Amtrak's Sacramento Valley Station, we grabbed our set of ready to go luggage then hit the road for Vegas. We'd brought along our dog April and her pal Misty for the ride. They both spent an evening at a dear friend's house and the next day we checked them in here at A-Vip Pet Resort. Not being a local I passed up the main road to this place several times thanks to Garmin. After a few drive-bys I found it...

The minute we parked, this place emitted a warm and welcome feeling. When we walked in, we were greeted by a nice gentlemen who was at the front counter. He gave us a run down on what the resort had to offer and what to expect. He got acquainted with our dogs while we filled out the paperwork. 

Soon enough we all headed for the kennels. The kennels come in different sizes and are "roomy" whether you have a large or a small breed dog. There's a roofed and shaded area to protect them from the elements and also a dog run. Each kennel section area was separated by a fence for each others protection. Though they provide dog food (chicken & beef) during the stay free of charge, you have the option of bringing your own dog food. However, they do not allow you to bring your own bowls, which they'll provide. April and Misty happily shared a kennel. We brought a pillow, a blanket and their favorite toys. 

During our visits we'd see how eager dogs wanted to rush in. I gather these were the regulars for doggy day care. I even watched an owner get pulled by her dog on a leash. The dogs were greeted by name as they checked in which was pretty cool! 

For thirty-five dollars a day for accommodations, food and overall care we felt it was a steal! Besides doggy day care & boarding they also offered pet training and pet grooming services (we had their nails trimmed). Did I forget to mention you can check in your cats too? That's right...

Prior to checking in your pets make sure that they are "kennel ready" meaning they're up to date with the latest required vaccination(s). Call the resort and your vet for more details.

We're very happy and glad that we've found this place thanks to Yelpers! Next time in Vegas our dogs will be back. Great customer service and just minutes away from the strip!...

It's been a while since I've been so inspired by a restaurant that I felt it necessary to write a review immediately after returning from my first visit. As you can see by all the glowing reviews so far, the Buddha Belly Deli is well on it's way to becoming a success story. I foresee this restaurant as having the uniqueness necessary to become one of the places that tourists come to for an "off the strip" experience. I also predict it to climb the charts in the Yelp list of top restaurants in Vegas/Henderson amongst the likes of The Sparklings and Soho Japanese. I was one of the first few customers of those restaurants when they were new and it's clear to me that Buddha Belly Deli has that certain "je ne sais quoi" that those other restaurants did. So mark my words here. This restaurant is definitely a keeper and if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely cross it off your to-do list. Get to it!

Enough about me singing Buddha's praises, let's talk about the food. I tried the top three items that all the trailblazer yelpers before me recommended and I was a fan of all three of them.

I started with the Thai Clam Chowder. Such an ingenious idea to merge an American classic with Tom Kha soup. Good stuff!

Then I moved on to the "Pho Dip" which is a Vietnamese spin on the classic French Dip sandwich. The dipping broth is pho soup. The sandwich consists of a soft & squishy fresh French bread, perfect for absorbing that yummy pho like a sponge. The inside is filled with slices of rare beef, jalapeos, onion and bean sprouts. A definite must try.

Last but not least I had the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy... Crispy shrimp, spicy Szechuan mayo & shredded lettuce sandwiched between a sliced baguette. It wasn't spicy enough for me so I think next time I'm going to try out the homemade spicy sauce that Nate was raving about and kick my sandwich up a notch.

Then there were the little touches, like the container of forks being labeled "Fork You" and the knives were labeled something else equally clever but I can't remember for the life of me. My point though is that it's obvious the owner thought of something creative right down to the last little minute detail... A detail that was not lost on me. Totally my style of the way I would do things if I had a restaurant. Now I must know what every single thing is labeled so I need to come back and see. Inquiring minds wanna know! Great conversation piece for guests.

I'm already plotting and planning my next visit. I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. Another patron was recommending their Sloppy Joe to me and said it's so good that it brings tears to his eyes. This is an awesome new addition to the community and it's right next door to a really good nail salon, not that you need any further incentive to visit but I'm just saying...

Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I "train" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.

Anyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR wasn't even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn't pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist. 

So after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers. 

The restaurant itself isn't anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly. 

The menu isn't so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn't deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn't so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.

We also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein's shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious. 

Our food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn't impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn't memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density. 

Overall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein's.  Dang those shakes really got me.

This place sucks ... don't come here.

It gets too crowded.  You won't ever want to come back.  I mean why in the world would you want to go out still after spending a grip of money at another club then come here to spend more?

The music sucks and I can't believe there are people dancing til almost 8 in the morning.  I mean who wants to see strippers come in after working and then spending the money they made here on more alcohol.

I guess I'll give you reasons why I didn't like this place at all ... 

I came with a group of guys ... never again
I came before 4am
I saw too many strippers here
I really hate the music they play here
Interior in Drai's is .... well just check out the website

In case you haven't figured it out yet ... just take everything and make it completely opposite.  

The 1 star rating is really a 5 star rating.  I don't hate this place, I really like it I just don't want too many people knowing about it because the line to get in is insane.  

I didn't come with a group of guys because mostly everyone else wanted to go back to the room.  But if you are coming with guys though, just separate and come in one at a time, you have a way better chance to get in, don't worry ... you'll see your friends inside once they eventually get in.

The only thing that wasn't opposite was the amount of strippers that come here.  It must be the music ... that's what gets me coming back.  Where else can you say don't come before 4a?

For me, coming to Drai's would be like going to the gym.  

You're tired, you don't feel like going.  But once you get there, you forget about all that other shit and you feel great.  Not to mention all the people watching that you'll enjoy while burning calories.

But there ain't ever a line at the gym like there is at Drai's.

I guess I should tell you it's at the Barbary Coast ... yeah, Barbary Coast.

The Skinny: foodie porn for the fine dining crowd at extremely reasonable prices... and when I say reasonable, I mean it's almost f%$king ridiculous (5) service: excellent personal service, my only gripe was that they probably need to fix the price labels on some of the shelves because they are outdated (invariably cheaper than the listed price though!) (5), Value: Stocking truffles, Iberico ham, preserves, all the little doodads to convert your kitchen into a molecular gastronomy lab? Absolutely priceless. (5!)

We've been meaning to come here for a while after reading about this store in a news article many months back. We heard that they obtain the best of the best exotic items for all the fine dining establishments in town. When we saw a livingsocial deal, we totally jumped on board to check what this place is all about.

When I walked in I was impressed. I mean when you look around store, there are massive paper bags with labels like "Guy Savoy" on them waiting to be delivered.

I wouldn't say this is your ordinary grocery store by any means so leave your grocery list at home. They stock hard to find items like fresh wasabi root, vanilla beans from like 4 different countries, exotic anchovies, olives, oils and vinegars. Not to mention, duck breasts and foie gras piled high in the refrigerator. Up on the shelf, they also had an array of different additives (like agar,etc.) used in a molecular gastronomy kitchen. Have a sweet tooth? There are a large variety of gourmet organic preserves, honeys and spreads.

Best of all was their charcuterie selection. OMG! They stock Iberico ham... as in the whole freaking leg. Iberico ham is the pride of Spain and is arguebly one of the finest hams in the world. The heritage organic pigs gorge themselves on acorns during the fall season, permeating their fat with delicious sweet nutty flavour. After curing for two years, voila! it's now here at this awesome little shop.

Ordinarily, at a restaurant, a couple ounces will set you back $40. Here, try $39 a pound (you have to buy like a 5 pound slab though). Luckily for their retail customers, they have little 2 oz. packages which will only set you back $7.50 (although it is the tenderloin portion... a little less fatty than the leg meat but still!). Is this a deal or what?

They also carried a variety of truffle butters. Normally, at Whole Foods a small 3oz container will set you back over $10. Here, it's only $4.65. Say what? you heard me... more than half freaking price!

We also tried some organic, pectin free, sugar free gourmet jam (wild currant, fyi) for a $5.80.

Artisanal Foods, where have you been all my life? I think I'm in love. 5 starred review.

I made note to check out what Kailyns Kitchen is all about after my foodie radar saw the sign when I drove by it after having lunch in the area. It's right behind Taco y Taco. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. It's Chef Robert whose at work at his open kitchen.  Both him and his wife (Carol?) own the place that's name after their 10 year old daughter (lucky kid!)

There is wait service so just seat yourself at the counter or at couple tables along the wall.  They were also getting call in pick up to go orders as well.
 
What appealed to me was the variety of different dishes on their menu.The menu is mostly American fare comfort food. Sandwiches like Grilled Cheese w/Meatloaf and Surf and Turf Burger sounds interesting..trying that next. Dinner meals had Blackberry BBQ Salmon listed.  Breakfast served all day. That's what I came for ..initially.

Steak Benedict with Hollandaise sauce.  I read that and that's all I wanted ...at first...then I read Mile High Pastrami...ooh..I want that too!.. same with Bulgogi tacos under 'Small Bites'... random item that stuck out. Oh heck why not order all three! I needed  to use up the Yelp Deal  for $10 for $20  I found on their page anyways.
  
The Pastrami came with garlic fries..with REAL garlic on it and you can have refill on the fries too. Pastrami thinly slice.  Bulgogi Tacos were regular size serving ..not the mini street taco size.  I liked it especially with the Sriracha mayo. The Steak Bene was my favorite though. The eggs were perfectly poached. I like the twist of having grilled steak w/ hollandaise sauce. Mmm good.  All the dishes were all plated nicely too.
 
I already see this diner fast becoming a  popular spot for locals and especially workers in the area. They were hustlin out those orders for the lunch crowd. The time I was there people coming to dine in were repeat customers. I can see why. The food is home cooked and is good! Prices are affordable. They run daily deals on their Facebook page I was told. Only thing, I just wish they were open longer hours. So I'm holding that 5th star hostage.
 
Both the owners are super friendly, open to suggestions and connect with their clientele. Chef Robert said he'll be expanding his menu..I suggested more veggie / vegetarian dishes :)  You know for #Meatless Mondays right?? Also they'll be expanding their hours soon too. Good thing, cause that Meatloaf w/ mushroom gravy sounds good for dinner!

oh..forgot! I had dessert too! Crispy Fried Cheesecake!  Cheesecake filling rolled up in a flour tortilla that's deep fried ( I think)...so good.. I finished that one...also I did manage to finish most of my food too...all by myself.

I don't like the heat. I don't like manual labor in heat. Also, fuck bees everywhere and grasshoppers that hit my face when I bend down to pick something. But there is something satisfying with it all, seeing where your food comes from and being excited you found the perfect zucchini hidden among the leaves. 

For those not in the know of this NW orchard, it's a pick-your-own farm where most of the fruits and vegetables are about $1 a lb, cash only. Open currently Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 7am - noon.  You can park on the street and walk in for free, or you can drive your car into the orchard for $3. If you want to know what is available, check their website! 

During the summer, I feel driving in makes more sense. Can get some AC inbetween the various plots. We were pressed for time, and we should've driven in. It's not huge, but it's big enough that there's a decent walk from the vegetables to the fruit trees. We didn't have time to get fruit since we came close to closing. 

When you walk in there is a station on the right where you can get plastic bags to put your produce in (or you can bring your own - get eco friendly!) , a map of what is planted where and it tells you what is ready to be picked. They also have wagons you can use. I highly recommend coming with gloves! Some of the squash plants were kinda prickly and hard to get a good grip of the stem to break it off nicely. I chipped one of my squashes tops and I think this is the kind of place to be decent if you break it, buy it and make sure the one you pick is what you want. It's cheap for being good quality, c'mon, don't be a dick and throw it on the floor to rot to save a dollar. Respect the place. 

What we went home with was 2 nice zucchini. 2 golden zucchinis, a large yellow summer squash and a large green squash (they were in a "various" plot so I didn't know what it was), 3 small beets, mini carrots, squash blossoms, a handful of green beans (who knew these grew in a bush?! They are very hard to see and handpick!), a bag of  small roasting potatoes. This was a total of $7. The zucchinis were good enough that I mandolined one and thew just some vinaigrette on it and ate it with some organic greens! 

On the left of the entrance, is the check out booth where they weigh your stuff. They had some garlic and potatoes already picked on sale there, some water, and some cider. There were only a few looking opened cider so I skipped out. I was looking forward to that, sadly. 

It's a interesting experience and something unique, fun and rewarding to do. I'll try to wake up more often and take advantage of the freshest possible produce...right by my house!

It had been a hot minute since I had been in Vegas but those in the know assured me that Hakkasan was THE place to be on the weekend. I'm always up for an all night dance party so I gladly paid ahead of time for a ticket to Calvin Harris on Saturday night. Although I know it's possible for girls to get in free pretty much anywhere in Vegas, to me this ticket was totally worth it to not have to worry about standing in ridiculous lines or bribing bouncers. 

The entry was confusing, as there were several different security and promoter people who kept herding us to different areas and telling us different things about what we needed - should we have our printed tickets out? Is an email pulled up on a phone ok? It took a while for everyone to finally get in the door because of all of the confusion. 

Once in, I have to say I was surprised that the interior wasn't more exciting and over the top. I expect big and bold and beautiful from Vegas clubs, but what I saw was more like what an 80s nightclub would look like in movies, with black everywhere and somewhat cheesy neon lights. I also thought the layout wasn't smart, as everyone is naturally directed to this one staircase to get to and from the dance floor and bars, which of course meant that everything got extremely congested. I know this is a hot club right now, but the crowds were ridiculous... I could barely move the whole night. 

These kinds of crowds also encourage theft. Four girls out of about eight in my group of friends got their iPhones and/or wallets stolen. Now we're not talking about people carelessly leaving their purses in booths and wandering away. These purses were on shoulders, and one or more a-holes were obviously using the crowd as a way to bump into people and dig in their bags. Several girls all around me that I didn't know also fell victim. It was really hard to dance my booty off when every few minutes I heard some poor girl scream 'my phone's gone!!!' Clutching my purse tightly to me, I told several security guards, all of whom nodded vaguely while avoiding eye contact. I knew they weren't telling anyone. And of course no one returned our calls when we called their number that night and the next morning. We were no longer their problem! 

I know in Vegas it's not really about convenience but about the wild night and the scene you're a part of. For that part of it Hakkasan did what I expected. But when it comes to treating your customers right, ones that are very likely to spread the word and come back and spend a lot of money if treated well, they unfortunately failed miserably.

A great family run, taste of Italy ristorante, that I say: "Ciao bella"!

We arrived last night looking forward to a well prepared Italian meal. Our expectations were peaked by all our Yelp friends, raving about the personal service and delicious old style Italian food. We weren't disappointed.

The owner, Pasquale greeted us as we came in, and sat us in the back.  It would provide a good place to observe his personal touch with all the customers.  Our server Cody came by almost immediately to ask if we had brought any wine, and if he could open it and bring us glasses.  As others have noted, Ristorante Giuseppe is a Bring Your Own (BYOB) place.

Our oldest was celebrating her Birthday Day, so we were in a festive mood.  I've taken some photos of the interior of the restaurant. Clearly they were working on that Italian Grotta feel.  It has some buca di beppo type wall decorations.  But unlike that chain, here it's decorated by actual family photos and vacations shots. Very genuine!  Just like Pasquale.

We started out with the bruschetta.  It came with four pieces of italian bread for $10.95.  It might have seemed pricey, though the tomatoes were sweet and had a interesting topping of several cheeses. Delicious.  We next shared the Antipasto.  It was a very full plate of greens, meats and cheeses for $8.95.  The dressing was a light oil and vinegar that was just right.

For our entree, we each tried something different.  I went for the capellini with their homemade Neopolitan sauce.  Cody talked me into one of their meatballs, which was good.  But, not as good as their pasta and red sauce.  Sometimes with a marinara, if it's left to cook too long it can get bitter.  Not here, it was naturally sweet with chucks of tomato.

My wife ordered her favorite dish of Chicken Parmigiana, that came with spaghetti for $14.95. It wasn't a pounded piece of chicken cutlet, but instead an entire breast. Very nice!  Our daughter ordered the spicy Pasta Alex  for $15.95.  The menu describes it as the Chef's creation -- of pasta in a cardinale/pesto sauce with roasted garlic and spicy, crumbled, Italian sausage.  It was outstanding!  The heat came from the crusted red peppers and was just right.  The sauce actually reminded me more of a vodka cream reduction.  It was sweet and full of flavor.  Clearly the best of all the dishes!

For dessert, we tried the flour-less Chocolate cake, the Tiramisu and a Cannoli for $4.95 each.  I've taken a picture of the Tiramisu, because it came as an individual piece of two moist lady fingers. Wow!  

If you're out and it's late, I would highly recommend coming here just for dessert and espresso.  It would be well worth it.

Our bill came to $88 in change including taxes but before gratuities. It was hand written and not itemized.  Another one of those personal touches which some might find quirky.

After getting home, I exchanged a bunch of messages with Yelp'er Michael T on how delicious the sauces were at Giuseppe's.  It's that unbridled enthusiasm and passion that folks have for this restaurant and it's owner Pasquale that make it special. 

If you are looking for a white table cloth, foo foo experience; you might be disappointed and not understand the beauty of Ristorante Giuseppe.  But, we weren't, and we'll be back real soon.

Enjoy!

So, it was time for me to stock up on bras.  I wanted to go get properly fitted, as I think every girl should at some point in thier lives.  

This place was great!  It's located right in Scottsdale, in the same shopping complex as Saba's Western Wear.  Its a small little boutique, cute, quiant and comfy.  It really felt like someones home.  Pink walls, lots of bras, and other odds and ends for women of all sizes.

This place caters to ALL women of every shape size and color.  They carry a full line of support for women who are full busted or not, along with post op breast surgery stuff as well.  They carry a full line of product.  They will even special order stuff for you.

On Saturdays, they are only open between 10-2, and closed on Sundays.  They advertise as being by appointment only, but you can walk in and shop just like I did.  I was greeted by a young lady who was professional in every way.  I asked her a lot of questions, and she was able to answer every single one for me.  I told her I just needed a few every day bras, nothing fancy or exciting.  

She had me step into a fitting room, and measured me for size.  She brought in a variety of bras, and I tried on each one to see what I liked best.  To my delight, most of the bras in the store were all reasonable in cost to what I would spend elsewhere...between $40-70 dollars.  

I should also mention that the measuring was obviously at no charge.  I was so thrilled to actually have someone who knew what they were doing during the entire session!  No pushy saleswomen, no bad information, no trying to upsell me on a bra I didnt want or need.  

I also found out that they have a location in Tucson, and that has been around for about 50 years, and thier Scottsdale location has been around for about 15 years.  Quite impressive.  

This place was totally what I needed.  Real service, by women who knew what they were doing, no pressure to by and I actually learned A LOT while I was there about bras and such.  Some of it I already knew, but some was new to me as well.

Give this place a try.  I think you'll be impressed, and be as happy as I was with the experience.

These are great vets! I should know. I've had more experience than most as my last dog had a form of hepatitis and was in and out of animal hospitals and veterinarians offices much of his life. Some vets view your animals as nothing but a dollar sign. It's sad to say but there are those that will order unnecessary tests and charge up your bill to kingdom come if they know that you are one of "those" that would pay whatever it costs to keep your little baby alive and well. Unconscionable and sick that anyone would put a poor and defenseless animal through additional pain and discomfort just to make an extra buck but it's actually more common than you'd think! I know that I've dealt with more than a few of those in the past. At Aloha Animal Hospital, it's not like that. 

I brought my dogs in for a teeth cleaning because I've heard that you are supposed to get your dogs teeth cleaned yearly. The vet checked out both of my dogs teeth and said they're ok and they didn't need it yet. Any other vet would have been scheduling an appointment for that immediately so they could make that money. And that's messed up! I actually hate doing the teeth cleanings because in order to give your dog proper dental care, you need to put them under anesthesia. That's a risk that you shouldn't be taken unless it is entirely necessary. By the way, they use human grade anesthesia here which is better tolerated by animals. It's more expensive but I'm not looking to cut corners when it comes to my dogs health. 

So yeah, I trust Aloha Animal Hospital, a trust that is not given freely given because of all the problems I've had with scammer vets out to make a buck off the pain and misery of my dog in the past. 

To show my great appreciation for their honesty and humane treatment of my little ones, I recommend them to all of my friends. Everyone that I have sent here has been happy. Not to mention the many smiles they have brought to my face when I see the pictures of my little ones in the back room dressed up like a bumble bee, an elf, hula dancer etc. As an extra special touch, Aloha Animal Hospital sends picture postcards to remind you of upcoming shots or checkups. The people that work here are on it! 

Also, everyone that works really loves animals. You can just tell by the way they treat your pets. Dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, reptiles, guinea pigs, whatever animal you have... you can entrust their health needs with Aloha. Bring em here. I promise that you won't regret it! 

Plus, that chocolate with caramel and macadamia nut treat they leave in the room for the owners sweetened the deal for me too. I'm not gonna lie! Most owners like treats just as much as our pets do. Mahalo! :)

Let me tell you friends, I've been on a MASSIVE seafood kick lately!  It's not just sushi though, it's everything and I want it well prepared and cooked to perfection.  So you walk into a place with the name "Wholey" and you expect it to "wow" you.  And you know what?  It did!

I was surprised to see the less than stellar reviews at first, but I had faith it was just the new restaurant jitters.  We came in on a random Tuesday night around 8pm and was surprised to see about 6 other tables full with diners.  Surprising to see in the Strip, but exciting, if you ask me!  

It's an absolutely gorgeous space.  Nothing you would expect from the Strip at this point and time.  It actually used to be a club, so there's many different levels.  I love the sea of blues and mosaic tiles.  The tables are large, so it's great for big parties.  

We started out with the Sashimi appetizer and it was so cold and fresh.  I loved the tiny mandarin oranges and crisp lettuce surrounding it.  We devoured it within 3 seconds of it hitting the table.  Good start!

The tomato salad will probably only be on the menu for a short time, considering the season for them ends soon, but it's worth having when you can.  You can easily throw together some tomatoes and splash on some balsamic.  This had a very well done pesto sauce and pine nuts.  I would have never thought of the combo together, but I loved it!  

I ordered the Scallops and Shrimp, which came with a hearty helping of jasmine rice and grilled bok choy.  Both the Scallops and Shrimp were seared to perfection and the scallops, which I find hard to season well, had a great flavor and were large in size.  I loved the creamy garlic sauce drizzled on top.  It was as if every element of the dish came together in harmony!  


While seafood can be expensive, and this was no exception for a $24 meal, I had no qualms about paying my bill for the amount of flavor that was packed into each dish.  Fresh is the word here and you won't have to reel me in... I'm coming on my own!

One word, delicious.

If you can read more than one word, then read on my friend cause this is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to. 

Some hobknobs might find the location a bit shady, but the interior of the restaurant is clean and well put together and makes you forget about all the bums across the street. Whataraya gonna do? Amirite?

This place has only been opened a week or so. The service here was good. While the waiters were new and seemed untrained in the usual customer service/waiter chatter, (family owned restaurant I assume?), they were still very polite and attentive, and boxed our food to-go for us. No complaints from me, they refilled my water glass often as I slew down all that spicy curry.

Good news for all vegetarians, half the menu is vegetarian based, which put me in a chipper mood right off the bat when we entered. They also have multiple chicken and lamb entrees if you're still craving the meat food. For me not actually being a big fan of curry, the food was amazing and I ate till I was beyond stuffed. I forgot the names of the dishes we selected, but I had a nine vegatable combo with mild spicy creme curry and my boyfriend had the traditional chicken curry. Both were just right in hotness and didn't leave a chalky taste in my mouth like most curry does.

The grand finaleeeee....Naan bread. mmm yes, that's right. the garlic naan bread here is so delicious I just wanted to go adopt a new puppy or something. Was so good that I got another frisbee shaped bread slice to-go.

With all that and an extra bowl of rice, the price for two was pretty decent. We ate there during the dinner hours where they gave us a menu, but they also do a lunch buffet which I have yet to try. I plan on coming back here as this place has awakened my curry craving. I'm getting hungry just typing about it.

Jump n' Jungle Family Fun Center is a blast!  My daughter and I have gone a couple of times and had a ton of fun!  Here are the highlights of this awesome play place:

1. This place is full of jumpy houses!  Jumpy houses or as some people call them, moon bounces, are the coolest things ever.  I was a  sad, sad girl when I was too old to go in them at birthday parties.  So when I heard about this place, it was immediately on my radar!  If your kiddos like to bounce, this is a great place for them!

2. Adults can jump too!  Yep, you can go into any of the houses or the jumbo slides right along with your kid.  Oh yeah, BABY!  Though I have to warn you, it isn't as easy to jump in those things any more.  I used to be able to jump for hours, now 5 minutes and Momma needs a breather!

3. The price!  This is one of the best priced indoor play places in town.  2 and under are only $5 and 3 and up are $8.  This is for an all day play pass.  Great deal, especially since many similar places all start at $10 or more per kid.

4. They have a room for the toddlers, as well as the main room for everyone.  This is nice, especially if there are a lot of bigger kids.  Your little ones can play in the toddler room and not get run over by the big kids.  

On a side note,  I would have to say that it is definitely for kids that are walking pretty well.  There isn't too much for kids that are smaller or just starting to walk.  Wait a couple of months on them, so they can have fun when they do come.

So yes, this place is super fun!  If you want to wear your kids out, bring them here.  If you need a core workout, go in the jumpy house with your kid for a few minutes and you WILL feel the burn!

I did an all Venetian restaurant tour on my most recent Vegas trip.  I had dinner here the second night of my stay.

We ordered the gnocchi w/ black truffles to start ($25).  For my entree I had a bone-in ribeye w/ foie gras ($72 - $52 for the steak & $20 for the foie gras), my friend had the regular ribeye ($48), and on the side we had haricot vert almondine ($11) & fingerling potatoes ($12).  

The gnocchi was very good.  It had a nice crisp and the truffles accented the taste of the potatoes in the gnocchi very well:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the steak was not very good.  It was fatty, chewy in some spots and not that flavorful.  The waiter stated that Delmonico's has the best steaks in town.  Sorry, but I have had better steaks at STK and T-Bonz in Summerlin:  2 Stars.  The foie gras was OK.  It was nice to see it on the menu because you can't find it in CA.  However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.

To accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.

The ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.

I will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.  The steak was lousy, the bathroom is lame and the service sucked for an establishment of this caliber.  Word to Emeril:  You need to work on this restaurant - BAM!!!

If you're a guy going to Vegas and thinking about getting into XS on girls night be prepared to wait at least 2 hours in the general admission line! We went over the weekend when Zedd was suppose to be playing but he canceled last minute due to "illness". XS offered to issue refunds but unfortunately i guess only to those people that didn't go in. Sucks for the rest of us eh? 

Anyhow the if you're not baller enough to drop a couple grand on table service and not on the guest list you'll need to wait through the Disneyland style queue. But hey if you also wanna be suckered by the bouncers or still wanna be baller you can pay off the bouncer to get into the "express line". That could cost you anywhere from $20-100 though. But hey this is Vegas money can buy anything right? 

The venue itself is pretty spectacular once you get in! It features a huge pool which yes people do jump into fully dressed or in there undies. Although be prepared to get kicked out if you get out of the pool soaking wet. Also be aware of them douches splashing everyone on the sides. Yes there are fights that break out randomly as we witnessed. 

The drinks are pretty standard and definitely pricey. But again this is Vegas so you gotta pay to play right! Cmon $5 for regular coke and $10 for a bottle of water too for those DD's! Cocktails and beers range from $10-20 as well. But hey if you got girls in your group and its ladies night don't forget to get them free drink vouchers! 

The music is a pretty much a mix of EDM but depends on the DJ spinning that night. Sadly we didn't get to see Zedd so we had some no name guy playing all night. The dance floor does get packed and watchout for them bouncers that will literally football style push everyone out of the way to make room for staff or the baller VIP table guests to get through. Yeah people be getting squished in the middle but oh wells its  Vegas right! 

If you're coming to see a specific artist play for the night definitely check XS's twitter or Facebook before coming! Otherwise go hit up Marquee or somewhere else!

Is Mon Ami Gabi all about the food or the view?
Before dining here I read the many reviews my friends wrote on Mon Ami and half talked about the food and half talked about the cool view of the strip and the people watching. Well, I'm happy to report that Mon Ami Gabi is great for both. 

Located at the Paris hotel, Mon Ami Gabi is a super popular joint because its huge outdoor patio sits right on the strip, with an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains. No matter what time of day you visit Mon Ami the patio is jammed pack full of people. 

Mon is a good spot to visit for any meal. Whether you want breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner you're bound to find something tasty. 
My wife and I ate breakfast here on our most recent trip to LV. I made reservations through Opentable.com and when we arrived we were sat on the patio within mere moments. After looking over the large menu and hearing their daily specials, this is what we ordered;

Me- Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict W/ caramelized onions, hollandaise sauce and hashbrowns http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=hXY6rJfbWKAbfpXatsJ-7g
My Wife- Strawberry Waffle W/ fresh whipped cream and a side of sausage http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Oym0dA3Z42jtulQx3f_BWQ 

My Benedict was amazing. The meat was super tender and flavorful and both the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce were perfect. I also really enjoyed their housemade English muffins. My wife's waffle was light and crispy and had a warm, fluffy middle. The strawberries that were on top of her waffle were extremely fresh and sweet. The side sausage was good too. To drink we both had a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ, which was super refreshing.

The prices here are really reasonable and our server was super friendly and helpful. 

My favorite part of breakfast though was by far the people watching. Even though it was early, the strip was littered with people who were staggering back to their hotel rooms after a long night of hard partying. And since it was such a cool, beautiful day in Vegas we took our times eating and had a wonderful time watching the entertaining crowd. Next time I want to dine here at night and watch the Bellagio fountain show. 
Check out Mon Ami Gabi for yourself. I know you'll love it.

I've read the reviews of Fat Choy my friends have posted and I knew this was a must try and I'm glad I did.

First of all, my server, Jenny, was an absolute delight.  She asked me about being there before and if I had any questions about the menu.  She was very helpful and very personable.  I was the only customer on this slow Sunday evening, and she had extra time and she spent it checking back with me a chatting.

I had looked at the menu online and I opted to try the bao.  I've never had Vietnamese bun bao so this was a new experience.  I ordered the duck and pork belly bao.  The duck bao comes with thinly sliced cucumber pieces, scallion, micro greens, and hoisin sauce.  The pork belly bao comes with one side of the pork seared, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, hoisin sauce, and some crushed peanuts.

The sandwiches were great!  The duck was my favorite because I simply love duck.  Jenny had brought me Sriracha and a small plate for putting the Sriracha and then using the plate as a dipping area.  It worked quite well!  The bun was very tasty.

Then the option came for dessert.  What's a person to do?  Ask Jenny for advice and certainly follow it.  I got the peanut butter cup which has a chocolate cookie-like bottom, then a layer of peanut butter mousse (my words), topped by some bits of crispy pieces.  I got it  la mode with vanilla ice cream.  The peanut butter is excellent.  Soft, creamy, and very rich!  I'm a fan--big time!

The restaurant uses the app Wallet so you can pay without pulling out the plastic and they'll email you a receipt if you want.  

The only drawback for me was the smell of smoke.  The restaurant is open to this small, locals casino and there's a smell of stale smoke as soon as you come in the door from the outside.  This permeates the restaurant and detracts from the overall experience.  I wish they'd put up some doors after scrubbing the place down and trying to get rid of the smoke smell.  But, I will be back.  Even though it's a small menu, there are things to try!

I love the 51 because, many years ago, I managed to lose a police helicopter that was following and tracking me with it's spotlight, in the middle of the night. I felt like James Fucking Bond 007. First of all because I have 0 respect for law enforcement officers and their Nazi-like "just following orders" arrests of people for victimless crimes, followed by locking them in government cages. Second of all, because I knew that the statistical chances of me ever being tailed by a Police helicopter and managing to lose it, at any time again in my entire life, approached 0. Third, because I spontaneously adapted an idea from an entirely different field.

Story time! Pull up a chair.

The setting: mid-late 1990's. Perhaps around 1996, 1997, when there was massive construction going on, on the 51. I lived downtown, on Roosevelt back then. Roosevelt then was NOTHING like it is now - most foot traffic was crack heads and transvestite hookers. But whatever, I'm from NY and I felt right at home. We're a tough breed. 

I had spent the evening visiting some people who were friends at the time -  if you remember The Congo, after it turned into the first Internet coffee house ("cyber cafe") in the Valley - it was the couple that made that happen.

It was late at night. I was driving home, tired. I just wanted to get home and into bed, so I was speeding. A lot. Next thing I know, there are light flashing all over my car. I look behind me and see nothing. Roll down the window and look up, thinking I'm about to be abducted by aliens in a Betty and Barny Hill type scenario. Nope! Just the Popos! They had their spotlight on me and were ordering me to pull over on the megaphone. 

First thought: Oh shit. I'm going to jail tonight. I had probably been smoking some high grade indoor sensimillia or something similar all evening. I know, dumb to do that and drive. I'm much more responsible now, so if you want to give me a hard time for being a dumbass at the age of 23, go right ahead and I'll probably agree with you - I was a with an outsized ego because I was... a computer programmer at the time. Sounds dorky but unless you've been in that world, you have no idea of the massively exaggerated sense of self worth a kick ass software developer can have. Now that I truly am that awesome, I look back and laugh. ;)

Anyway, I digress, Back to my police problem.

Brainstorm! Amazing what the chemically altered mind can come up with. 

I've always had an interest in military tactics and strategy, even though I never joined any army. I'm a history buff, and it makes history come alive. Only I didn't learn this tactic by reading about ancient armies prepping the battle field, or reading about their troop formations, or reading one of my all time favorites, Sun Tzu. I learned it by watching the Robotech and Macross cartoons. 

I remembered a tactic called Fokker's Feint, named after a German WWI flying ace. In a nutshell - you're being chased. You gain speed but then slow down rapidly, before your opponent in the dogfight has a chance to respond. He zooms past you, you get behind, and now he's in your gunsights.

Since my car wasn't equipped with heat seeking missile launchers, lasers, or other cool accessories, just a CD player, shooting it down wasn't really an option. 

Instead, a plan came together. The best part was, I realized that if it failed, they'd have no idea of what I was trying to do, so I had nothing to lose. Go big or go home! Or in this case probably directly to jail, not passing go and not collecting $200.

At the time, the 51 was under construction Well, lucky for me, this construction involved a long stretch of the 51 that was just ahead of me having no street lights at all. Also, there was an exit coming up - if I recall correctly it was somewhere between Northern and Bethany Home.  I'm thinking Glendale, but as I mentioned, I wasn't exactly sober and this is going back a ways, so I don't recall.

Calculations going through my mind: I am going fast. (prob 90+). Helicopter going same speed. Tracked by helicopter with spotlight, which uses my headlights to tell where I am. Street lights which illuminate the freeway - off. I have one chance to do this right.

I sped up another 15 MPH so I was going past 100. Helicopter speeds up to follow, megaphone guy goes nuts, telling me to pull over. Then.... as I approach the freeway exit.... I turn off the car headlights, slam on the brakes, and pull off the exit. I watch as the helicopter zooms right past me, down the freeway. It then starts circling the freeway to figure out where I went - I watched, parked with my lights out in a parking lot right off the freeway. 

My windows were rolled down and I'm pretty sure I heard helicopter guy drop the F bomb over the megaphone. I waited for the flying pigs to leave, then took city streets the rest of the way home, careful to drive the speed limit and obey all traffic laws. 

Whew.

Blah, blah, blah.... best pizza in the world.... Almost silly for me to write a review about Chris Bianco's Pizzeria, but here goes....

Kari and I cook at home, for ourselves and for groups, 5 or 6 days a week unless we're traveling. And we often cook even when traveling. Doesn't leave us much time for going out to eat. That said, our little group hits Bianco EVERY week. It's a ritual. One night a week, we go early, drink wine, get a grilled cheese or cheese plate, and wait... sometimes waaaaaaaaaaait. Knowing them doesn't get you in faster; in fact it might be a detriment. But it never disappoints. You really just have to make a night of it.

Tips for making a night of it:
  - come with people you know & like. a first date there can be brutal!
  - bring layers: if the wait is long, the weather can change.
  - plan on drinking and getting snacks next door at Bar Bianco.
  - bring games or other distractions: we're the idiots that bring mexican train dominoes or dice every week.
  - when Sue quotes you a time, it's accurate. live it.
  - make friends with the people who are waiting near you. some of them are in our foodie circle now. it's like a micro-YELP at the picnic table.

We've eaten pizza all over the country, all over the world... NYC, SF, Italy, Des Moines, IA & St Joe, MI... wherever! To say that one and only one pizza is the "Best Pizza in the World" is kind of ridiculous. But if I had to pick only one, last pizza, it would be Chris' Special - whatever he wants to make that night.

(disclaimer: i'm not gonna order the special tonight, i usually let everyone else do that and eat theirs. i'll order exactly what i want: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic. but IF it were my last pizza ever... the special. and that night, the special would probably be: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic).

I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entre was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entre alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called "Bacon Bar", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the "Dining Area", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.

My friend and I have wanted to go to the Butterfly Wonderland for a while and the time came to go! We met up on a Sunday morning and got our ticket to check them out!  

What does Butterfly Wonderland got going for them? Well they are the only butterfly atrium in the valley and they say they are America's largest butterfly atrium too. , they say the butterflies inside the conservatory come from butterfly farmers from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Ecuador, Thailand & the Philippines as well as within the US and another fun fact Arizona is home to 344 species of butterflies.  Here comes the sticker shock: its 18.95 plus tax which equals to 20.26 I think it was.  

Once you pay your ticket you walk inside and have to wait in a hallway because you will be directed to watch a 14 minute movie on the migration of the Monarch Butterfly in 3D, we had to wait a few minutes because there was a show already playing.  The movie is cool; you follow a year in the life of a few Monarchs. 

Once your movie is over you are shown into the conservatory, now this is where the fun is it, so many amazing beautifies fluttering around, some look like they are in a game of tag, some just seeing what everyone else is up to, if you stand still and make small movements you might be blessed to have a few land on you, also was told if you wear bright colors they will be attracted to you too, You are not allowed to hold out your hand or try to touch them, but they are allowed to land on you.  I had a few land on me and also had a few fly too close to my face and gave me a butterfly smack or too! Haha  I could spend hours in the conservatory just watching the butterflies enjoying the sun light.

A few things, the conservatory is a tropical rain forest, its humid and misting water is happening, so dress for the rain forest, leave your bags & purses in the car, no need for all that, watch where you are walking the butterflies land everywhere and just make sure you don't step on them. Also inside the conservatory you will see a Koi fish pond, I thought that was cool but also thought hey don't they eat bugs that might land on the water,aawwee poor butterflies that became fish food .

Once you leave the conservatory you go into a smaller room and check to see if you are smuggling any butterflies, and I know that sounds funny, but there were a few that tried to escape before we went through the door. 

Then you get to check a cool ant farm, some fishes and other stuff, and even stick your hand in a tank to touch a sting ray, and yes I did that, but I have fed sting rays before too, it's a cool experience.

This was an enjoyable time, we spent maybe 2 hours enjoying everything, do I feel its worth the 20 buck entry fee, no I don't, but will I be a sucka and do it again yep I will haha.

This was one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special meal.  I got the 6 course chef's tasting menu.  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed dinner and time to get to the show.

David took my order after answering some questions I had about the menu--a menu I had poured over online.  He was a great help.

There were five canaps delivered shortly after.  They're small and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the salad of watermelon and dragon fruit, passion fruit, and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!

The first course was glazed Skate with red miso water, spring vegetables and Paris mushroom duxelle.

The second course consisted of the 3 small bites--a grilled prawn on spinach velout with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip, toasted sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi tuna, and cuttlefish.

Course three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.

The fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!

Course five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was excellent and the tart fruit with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!

The last course was dessert which consisted of 5 different small desserts.  They were a coffee panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua, Coffee Gele and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a "Bella Vista" granit.  Then a fresh coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire meal, the flavors developed in the desserts was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought?

Service was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced tea got low, a server brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a server was at the table with a box of Kleenex.  Service with a smile and funny!  The same server also brought me a small Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the menu items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The server wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!

The restaurant is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.

Truly a wonderful dinner, about 2 1/2 hours.  It's worth the cost for the chance to try some unique foods in a unique setting with superb service!

We arrived at 5:00 pm to check-in and were told by the front desk agent that our room wasn't ready yet and that they couldn't give us an estimate of when it would be. The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us, they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was, we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.

After a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account, we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. 

The front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night, and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50, not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her, she brought in the front desk manager, David Bayley, who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.

After coming back at 5:30, we asked a front desk agent, Kira, if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us, implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually, she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of "good will", but refused to do anything else, telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.

We, of course, were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager, David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint, he came out to tell us, essentially, to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us, and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.

First of all, this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up, then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail, and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of "good will" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time, we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.

Second was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of "good will" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar, treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. 

Finally, the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit, which certainly was the impression we received, good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. 

At the very end, after they finally canceled out our balance, I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David, to his credit, wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira, however, wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - "Kira". No last name, no phone number, no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately, Kira seemed to lack both.

Don't stay at the Cosmo. Your dignity is more important than having a nice view.

Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. And no, I don't mean great value. I mean it's obvious how many corners they cut with this place. I love the sls in BH and this place feels like a budget motel in comparison. 

We paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a "lux corner suite" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress, thin sandpaper sheets, cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners, which, oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst "luxury" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. 

Not to mention, right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No, we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. 

The finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already, but given that I love the sls BH, I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they "already told me so."


Update: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total, $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as "gratuity".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.

Even asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering.

We chose Carnevino for our fancy dinner out during a recent bachelorette party. We were happy to find that they were able to accommodate our large group (8 girls) for dinner, but were a little paranoid when they told us they'd charge us $50 for each person that didn't show up. They were also really persistent about checking up on us in the days leading up to the dinner - maybe they have a lot of experience with flakes in Vegas?

Anyway, we were immediately really impressed by the space. It's dim and romantic and very upscale. They put us in a semi-private little nook which I liked because we were still able to see out into the main dining area but still got some privacy. 

I have to say the service here was excellent, though I wasn't so impressed with the food. Our waiter was really helpful in determining how much we should order and making recommendations, though I did get the impression that he was trying to upsell us. If we ordered as much as he suggested we would have been too stuffed to walk after our meal! However, he took it in stride when we ordered only some of what he recommended. 

The meal started with some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes, which were a small bite and very savory and tasty, as well as a bread basket with choice of butter or lardo to spread on top, which I thought was a nice touch. 

To start, we had the grilled octopus and two of their salads. I enjoyed the arugula salad with a triple cream cheese but the other starters were not so memorable. We also went with the ribeye, which was yummy but to be honest nothing special compared to other steakhouses I've been too, both expensive and more affordable. We also weren't super impressed with the pastas we had - a black fettucine with crab, a gnocchi and orrechiette with sausage and broccoli. They were all fine but definitely not memorable (I just had to look up the menu on the website to recall what we ordered!) To be honest, the highlight of the meal was the side of mashed potatoes we ordered, which comes with a poached egg and some sort of bacon type meat. It was so indulgent and rich! But I was a bit disappointed that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of this extravagant meal. 

Though I was totally impressed with the ambiance and service, the food unfortunately didn't measure up for me. With so many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas, I don't think there's time to waste on mediocre expensive meals!

This may be the only time I ever give a 5 star review and never return back b/c I definitely feel like a creeper in the Teazer.

A few friends wanted to check out the cafe after indulging in a massive food coma across the street.  As we walked in I'm not gonna lie - i was nervous - it felt like going to my first nudie club when I was prepping for SATs.  

Don't come off like an OCG-IT....Don' come off like an OCG-IT .that's Old Creepy Guy....In training.   I like to think i have another 5-10 years before the IT is removed.  

We were greeted by Courtney who was really sweet.  She sat down with us and told us all about the menu.  I really cant remember much about the boba drink I had but for 5 bucks it was great!   We played 6-7 games of Uno with Courtney's house rules and then played a version of Big 2 or VC.

I definitely then pulled the creeper move but i SWEAR it was on accident......she asked our names and it went around the table and for some reason Charlie came out of my mouth.   If you don't know me, Charlie is no where close to what my name is.  Nowhere in the ballpark......At this time my friends were telling a story so i didnt want to butt in and after a few minutes i wasnt gonna say -- oh heyyyyy..... by the way.... my name isn't Charlie....so i ultimately passed the point of no return.  No notes needed - creepy move executed......check

Eventually later, my name came up and did the explaining.  Anyhow time flew by - things felt more natural - the girls are sweet and easy to talk to.  Take care of these girls and tip well.  They go above and beyond exemplary service of any food server.  

I'm not sure if i'll be back after pulling an OCG.   Side note - As I was walking out I saw 2 master Yelpers probably the Co-Dukes not counting the owner... decked out in suits - that was pretty pimp.

Forte was mysteriously closed on a recent Saturday night, yet my wife was unable to shake her hunger for Eastern European cuisine.  Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials "you're not you when you're hungry"?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. 

I found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!

Our friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entres were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    

I should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  
   
Got talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  

So the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!

Stopped by on Thursday to celebrate National Nacho Day after seeing Marc M.'s post and what a treat!  I had originally planned on going to another place down the street but I had Julia's bookmarked for a while so why not try something new?

Situated in what was once a Target's parking lot, this small and unassuming restaurant was quite an adventure.  Upon walking in, there's a distinct smell of mesquite.  Whether it's artificial or just for show, who cares?  It smells great.  There's a generous bar of all sorts of grilled meats, fixings, and salsa.  The menu is kind of confusing but I already had made myself a note before to try their soft tacos.  The best day to get tacos are Tuesdays, mind you, when they're $1.50 each.  Mr. W. had the Crazy Thursday special which is a green-sauced enchilada if I remember right and we also had nachos. 

At first I wasn't sure what to expect.  The lovely lady had made the enchiladas first.  First warming up the tortillas and then filling it with cheese before sprinkling more cheese on top only to be be put into the microwave.  That had us exchanging a side-glance at each other.  But when I saw her making my little street tacos and stuffing it full of marinated chicken and topping it with pico de gallo and other stuff, I had forgiven her for the microwave business. Then she had started pouring ladles full of cheez whiz onto the nachos.  I just wanted to tuck in.  Our meal was $23 for the both of us so my wallet was happy.

So how did everything taste?  Delicious!  The carne asada on the nachos and my marinate chicken in the tacos were both delicious, flavorful, and moist.  The portions are decent for the price and the salsa bar was a mini adventure on its own.  I wanted to try them all but I was scared and unsure on which ones were mild and which ones were a blazing inferno.  I wish there were little signs.  Oh well.  

Nonetheless, Julia's served up a decent dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again.  I think I want to try a burrito or a taco salad next time!

Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. 

This review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. 

Like I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. 

The washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently "broke down" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to "resolve" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.

But, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. 
I called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. 

I then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final "pulled strings" to "accommodate" my original delivery request. 
But...it's not over yet. 

The second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. 

I don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. 

So my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. 

This is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment.

All you need to know:

Peach cobbler is so good, it'll make u slap ur momma!

Brisket is moist, juicy and melts in your mouth.

Fried Okra is the best in town hands down.

Catfish is properly seasoned, crispy on the outside and juicy and flaky on the inside.

So we walked in on a Saturday night at around 11 or so and we were the only ones in there. So I will admit, I wasn't sure if the reviews were going to be right. I mean if this place was going to be as good as everyone said, then why isn't this place packed?

But we sat down and the guy was friendly and down home. I love a southern gentleman, they win me over every time. He told me that they were out of the beef ribs but if I wanted to wait 45 minutes that they would be ready. So I didn't want to wait 45 minutes and went with a meat platter. I got the brisket and st Louis ribs and hot links. Already told you about the brisket, the ribs I enjoyed too. They were tender and smokey and very flavorful. If I am being honest, then I would probably pass on the hot link. I think they were just bbq'ed too long for me. 

So we got dessert with our yelp check in and I wasn't too sure that they would taste so good based on their appearance. We ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. I would alone come for the peach cobbler but again, if I am being honest I would pass on the banana pudding.

I love BBQ. It is just always so hard to find a good decent eats for BBQ in this town. But the quest for me has ended here. I rave about this place to everyone. 

The BBQ sauce here is amazing too. Sweet and Spicy. I tried to see if they bottled it and sold it but they don't. So instead they gave me a to go container for free.

I can't wait to come back.

I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. 

The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the "Banana Cream Pie" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on "Carot Cakes" and "PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!

Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested "Portuguese Sausage And Eggs". He said they have a "Garlic Rice" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. 

They have a great kids menu at affordable prices.

When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!

My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!
Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    
 
As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? 

Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!

Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  

Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. 

Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!

Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  

Trio of Caviar 
Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. 
Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  
Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       

Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.

Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. 

Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.

Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. 

Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!

If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!

They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.

I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience
of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. 

But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!

Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!

Oh I really enjoy this buffet....

In the past I never really enjoyed the buffet at Mirage, but ever since Cravings buffet was established I've became a fan of this place...

The decor is sophisticated at it's best.. all the nice LCD TVs along the entry way showing a slow motion of an egg being dropped into a pile of flour.... awesome way to start a buffet!  (lots of other food related video clips for your enjoyment!)

Here are the typical review section for a buffet...

Pizza:  Pretty good.. probably about as on par as CPKs... so pizza lovers will enjoy.

Carving station:  Prime Rib and Ham.... decent prime rib as it was more red than how I've liked it, but the server was nice enough to carve the other side for me and was very attentive!  Definitely a plus!

Mexican food section:  Had some breakfast burrito but didn't taste that great.. pretty dry in preparation so decided to past on this section for the rest of the time there.

Cold seafood:  Had snow crab legs and shrimp cocktail for brunch!  Cool!  I didn't really eat too much of this because it seemed too early for me for crab legs but others were diggin this!

Hot seafood:  Had some paella, pesto cream mussels, and some salmon... they were all fair tasting.

Special metal room for fresh Chinese noodles!  This was my favorite!  A chef is inside this steel room cooking fresh noodles with the options of wonton soup or beef stew soup.... had some gyoza and also few dim sum servings (little shrimp wrapped in rice paper), all very tasty!  The best part was hot roast duck and BBQ pork to go along with the noodle soup!  YUM!!!  Definitely my favorite!

Chinese food section:  Not a big fan... bored of all the orange chicken that everyone is serving and beef with broccoli, I think I will past for sure..... (But the egg drop duck soup was very delicious!  Not salty yet sweet tasting!  Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)

Crepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!

Salad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!

Dessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....

Cravings...... I can't crave you anymore for today.... maybe another time.....

I've been here seven times since the end of March. I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed with the flavors, innovation, quality, prices, and hospitality. Every experience has been spectacular! When I try to explain exactly what "Modern Japanese" means, it's never the same description because I can't quite put it into words. My best explanation is a photo paired with a detailed caption. I usually don't need to say anything else. The presentation and methodical usage of ingredients elevates itself from other Japanese and fusion establishments and has become a category of its own. So, what is Yonaka? A place that will intrigue your tastebuds and incite conversation of excitement and surprise.

I've had the pleasure to try many dishes during my multiple visits. I wish I could write about all of them! I really enjoy the items that involve sashimi or other raw seafood and feature a wonderful balance of sweet and savory elements and textures. The dishes truly heighten the different flavors of the sea creatures and such an experience than your typical sashimi. The menu is impressive and ever-changing. Simply the list of ingredients will intrigue you and the best part is they keep some of it a surprise (although they are happy to share the details).

Sake Orenji ($11): Scottish Salmon sashimi, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon and orange oil, maldon, and micro arugula. The sauce is their take on Ponzu and it is delicious. This is a great example of the sweet and savory balance. I've had this dish during every visit and the salmon is always so succulent.

Nana Iro ($13): Hamachi sashimi, grapefruit supreme, avocado, golden cherry tomato, pickled fennel, dehydrated fennel, and chili sauce. I'm already a big fan of raw yellowtail, but I really dig this combination of flavors. Highlights: the non-tart grapefruit and dehydrated fennel.

Tea Brined Ribs ($10; HH $7): Pork ribs, citrus-honey-tea glaze, sesame seeds, topped with negi. These ribs are on-point. Flavorful and the meat falls right off the bone! I love the fresh negi with every bite.

Tate Ichigo ($13): Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, negi, apricot and strawberry relish, hibiscus salt, Thai chili, negi oil, and strawberry sauce. I love the soft texture of the raw scallops with the sweet and juicy strawberry slices. You get just a little bit of heat at the end as well.

Mango Cotta ($8): Mango panna cotta filled with mango pure, pistachio butter, crumbled pistachio, mango ice cream, and mango tuile. One of my favorite desserts, ever! The panna cotta has the perfect consistency and even with the pure, it isn't too sweet. The pistachio marries well with the mango and all the textures make it fun.

Although these are my favorites, I've enjoyed mostly everything. I really like the Foie Gras Nigiri, Yoshoku, Avocado Nigiri, and Crudo as well (to name a few), however, I'm not a big fan of the Tsutsumi, Buko Jam, or Tuna Tataki. The Specials Menu ensures that you don't tire of dishes and also highlight seasonal ingredients. The Happy Hour Menu (Daily 5PM-6:30PM, M-Th 10:30PM-12:00AM, F-Su 11PM-2AM) also features items not available on the Regular Menu like the delicious Hana Wings.

Helpful notes: Bring a couple friends and share several dishes since most are perfect for 3-4 people. Most importantly, this is not a place to dine and dash. As I'm sure you've seen the photos, the dishes are intricate and obviously take time to prepare. Heed the warnings and don't visit while in a hurry! I usually allot two hours and it's given me enough time to really enjoy the meal and my company. Reservations can be made via OpenTable or phone. Happy Hour is offered at the bar and booth area only and not available for reservation. The bar is a great place to sit to watch the chefs at work! It's mesmerizing. This isn't your typical sushi bar, so orders are placed with your server. Also, I haven't tried the Omakase since I was fortunate to visit with seasoned patrons, however, it's a great way to try their popular dishes and not worry about what to order. Lastly, this is a place to leave your preconceptions at the door. Don't let the ingredients or combinations intimidate you and just go for it.

Herbs & Rye was one of those late dinners with Terri R that was on a whim.  Herbs & Rye looks like a pub on the outside, even has that feel when you walk in. All I know is that it was a very long day, I was starving, and anything that was food would have hit the spot.  In other words, I didn't expect much coming in. Maybe a good thing that I didn't expect much because I was actually surprised by the menu.  I expected nothing but fried dishes or meals with zero sustenance. What I found was a menu ranging from apps to steaks.  Prices are not pub prices though.  Price here is what you are to expect at a steakhouse.  A ton of really tempting items on this menu like Filet Mignon and Lobster, Burgers, and other steak options.  

With all the recent talk about White Castle here in Vegas for the last couple of days (compliments of the Foodie Fest), I decided on their sliders.  The presentation of these sliders is probably the best I've seen in awhile.  It at least kicks White Castle's butt.  I thought that the sliders were pretty good, but just a little rich.  We also got their fully loaded calamari.  To me, I thought it was one big workout killing mess.  It had a ton of what appears to be mayo, bacon, and some other add ons.  Both Terri and I, scraped off this mess and ate some calamari the way it should be eaten.  

As for the ambiance, you can say that you get two types.  When you walk in, you have the bar to the right where all the action is.  It's louder, brighter, and this is where everyone else is eating.  Then you got the quiet side where it's dimmer, quiet, and barely where anyone is dining.  Normally, I'm good with either side. But on this night, the dining was a little too tight on the bar side. So, we ate where it was quieter and darker.  Since it was also late, keeping ourselves from falling asleep was a challenge in itself.  My other concern is that we would be forgotten and our orders never taken.  This wasn't an issue at Herbs & Rye.  Regardless which side you choose to eat, service seems to be right on. 

Overall, Herbs & Rye is a decent place to meet with friends, grab a drink, and some dinner.  I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general, but I still have my favorites.  Herbs and Rye can easily be one of them.  

PS:  I don't drink, but there's a some great Happy Hour specials here.  For all you HH dudes and gals, give this place a try.

My traveling companions decided to go and get pampered at a hotel spa and rely on a trained professional to provide some comfort into their lives, but I nixed that idea because for me comfort comes in the form of good food passing from my mouth to my belly.

I found myself exploring the Cosmopolitan on my own when I came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced Chinese food in one window and Mexican food in another.  I stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what I thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.

Since I was dining alone I was seated at the dim sum bar where I had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=zE32BWJoqOAZL4TmaNlT3w) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  I decided to order from both the Chinese and Mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.

For starters I ordered one of two Agua Frescas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=W60P4p4WhAKZMHqhVyGHmw) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  From the Dim Sum menu I selected the Sui Mai Scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the Har Gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  From the Tacos menu I selected an individual Carnitas taco and the Pescado Frito taco.  I agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.

The Pescado Frito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=8cIp34h9uM_xmdh4LajsUg) taco arrived first.  On paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a Mexican salsa, but the fish I had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  No matter its preparation I liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  This was a very simple but very good fish taco.

The Carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=9WJy0kQq33M7dBVaCtAbNw) was up next.  This was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  When the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  If I really wanted to pig out I could have easily devoured another three of these.

The dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until I was ready to enjoy.  This helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while I worked on my tacos.

I had the Har Gau (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ugVecr8s4E13Ak4f0t3P8w) first.  These were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  The shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while I didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.

I saved the Sui Mai Scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=OG_yUcneFS9wu0I9ejqQLg) for last.  These were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais I've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  In terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  The soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  I enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food I just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.

Uh, guys, I won't be joining you for dinner tonight.  I'm stuffed!!

There aren't many of us out there, but I'm Luxy enough for this to be my neighborhood coffee stop.

Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing. 

While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.

Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from "home" type of thing.

Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app. 

The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!

Happy Yelping Phoenix! It's time for today's caffeine fix.

When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!

I toyed with this rating for a while. 4 or 5? Man 4.5 would be perfect! I settled on a 4 based on my first visit, but I can see myself upgrading on future visits. 

We all know the history of this building. An old beauty parlor. I love how the building was preserved. There are old photos all over the business and even have parlor chairs at the bar. 

Starting from the main door you pass a garden where the cooks grow their own herbs and produce. Very cool, I wish I was good enough to grow all my own herb, but i know they would just wilt up and die.lol.anyways you can see a real,nice cozy patio while you walk up to the door. You are greater by a host to great you if you want a table in the dining room, or you can go right into a small bar area.

Service was good the entire. I really dug the decor.  Hard to explain,  but it was a little dark and just overal hip and romantic at the same time. What I'm trying to say I would feel just as comfortable with my buddies here as if I was on a romantic date with my wife. That is super cool. 

Now for the food. We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer called Fritto Misto. Wow, when that came out it was just awesome! I couldn't believe how juicy the shrimp were. The sauce was also great for dipping.  I would totally order this again!

For the pizza we ordered the Proscuitto Cotto. It wasn't what I was expecting, even though the server told me. But there was no cheese on the pizza, just proscuitto and a smokey tomato sauce. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd like to try something with cheese on it next time.

Also while we were dining the music track playing was surprising good! I saw a fellow Yelper that commented in how much the music rocks. He's right, every song was good!  

I will be coming back to the Parlor again. This time to try a pizza that more fits me, and I would expect my rating to improve afterwards. Overall The Parlor is a great local Phoenix restaurant. I can't wait to take my out of town friends here

After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say "I'll......have......this.".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. 

With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. 

It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. 

Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!

The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.

The table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!

Another bookmark bites the dust! I actually bookmarked this place a long time ago after seeing someone post a picture of a yummy looking pastrami sandwich, which I knew my husband would love trying. When we walked in and I saw they had pizza and other stuff on the menu I was excited to give this place a try. They had the typical "pizza by the slice" sitting out on the counter as well the same thing with the garlic knots. I don't mind when pizza is sitting there and gets re-heated, if it is good pizza it can handle it. What I don't like is when it has actually been sitting there for hours. With this place being located across the street from UNLV, I would figure if good pizza is put out here, it wouldn't last long with a college crowd around. I love trying garlic knots from different places, but just couldn't do it here since they looked greasy and like they had been sitting there for a long time. Bummer.

I just asked for a regular slice of cheese ($2.25 each) and a Sicilian slice ($2.50 each) to-go. The regular cheese slice was almost not edible. The slice had too much cheese on it weighing it down and when I picked up the slice it immediately flopped. No folding with that slice! It just lacked any "wow" flavor for me. The Sicilian slice however was perfect. The crust was crisp and chewy where it needed to be and I enjoyed every bite. I'm really glad I tried both because just trying the regular slice wouldn't have me wanting to come back. I don't usually see places that sell Sicilian by the slice so that is a bonus plus the fact that it tastes legit. 

They have Boar's Head lunch meat for sale and a variety of sides. Inside appeared clean and there are tables or booths inside and tables outside. Catering is offered. Delivery is offered.

I've seen my friends talk a lot about this place. I've never had Japanese style BBQ before, and being a big fan of grilling your own food at a restaurant, I was excited to try out this spot.

Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.

Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.

The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.

Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.

The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.

I don't know if I'll be back here. My experience was so-so. Maybe I'll come back here later in the future if they improve their service. But I thought the food was aight except for the cheese wontons, which were a ripoff. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

I've heard a lot of buzz about St. Francis and was eager to try it because I am always on the lookout for new restaurants in CenPho. I was not disappointed. This restaurant design and layout is as fantastic as the food and service. 

The Spot: 
Located on 1st and Camelback this gorgeous building boasts original brick walls and polished concrete floors downstairs. I had inquired about the upstairs and my server let me sneak a peak, the floor upstairs is made of cork, very unique and gorgeous. The contemporary design really stands out. There is a support system of cable and pin settings, which do away with support columns (so said my dining partner), and it creates a very open and airy flow.  The women's restroom has an original safe built in to the wall with the handle acting as a toilet paper roll. The bar opens to both the restaurant and the patio so giving diners a sense of comfort. There are also pop out windows, so you are able to see in to the kitchen from almost any spot. Currently only the downstairs is open, with plans to open the upstairs within a few months. (The upstairs would be a great place to have a big birthday dinner, seating about 40). The patio wraps around the restaurant and will provide additional seating once the weather cools off a bit.

The Chef:
Aaron Chamberlin was part of the opening team for some of my favorite restaurants in the valley: Chelsea's Kitchen, LGO and Radio Milano. He has over 20 years of experience and his French/Mediterranean training helps him to create phenomenal dishes, with top quality ingredients. The kitchen has a brick chamber used for roasting meats, vegetables and breads. The oven and selected spices really brought out the flavor in each dish. 

The Food:
The menus will change seasonally to take advantage of the ripest produce Arizona has to offer. The current menu incorporates local ingredients such as Arizona pistachios, honey and goat cheese from Black Mesa Ranch. St. Francis is one of only a handful of restaurants that are able to use rare herbs from Sonoma. 

Last night I started with the baked goat cheese with walnut herb pesto and toasted bread, it was absolutely delicious. The cheese and walnuts were so fresh I had to go easy not to ruin my appetite for dinner.  For my main I had the pepper-crusted flat iron steak with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes covered in a red wine reduction.  The steak was phenomenal; it was so tender I could cut it with a fork. I was also pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the creamed spinach.

Desert was also amazing; I went with the summer fruit trifle as it seemed a lighter dish. It had strawberries, peaches, raspberries and some other berry I couldn't nail down, all surrounded in a light cream topped with toasted almonds. It was heaven.

The Service: 
The server was awesome. She explained the philosophy of the restaurant along with the vision of the chef. She was quick to point out her favorite meals and her parents were seated next to us. It was nice to see so many friends and family in a newly opened spot. 

This place will become a part of my regular restaurant rotation in CenPho. Quality ingredients, wonderful layout and educated staff make this a 5 star review.

In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!

When we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!

We showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.

We looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called "kids" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.

As for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.

The three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!

If you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!

Well, I have to admit that I wasn't expecting to be blown away by the cuisine here, but goodness gracious was I. Stopped in promptly after 5pm to sample this new East Blvd restaurant installment and I'm thrilled that we did. It's in the old Sutton House building at the corner of East and Kenilworth. You can't miss it now. Upon the Yellow brick rests a glorious mural facing the Kenilworth side and it's gnarly. Really like the aesthetic. 

The interior has your typical kitschy bar decor, pop art on surfboards, and plenty of beer paraphernalia. Tables, booths along the east wall, ample bar seating, 25 draught beers with plenty being local(s), cocktails a gogo, and a moderately expansive menu. On to the meal.

Started with the chips and salsa -- Pineapple and tomatillo. The pineapple salsa was great, perky, laden with cilantro, and super sweet. It worked well with the lime salt on the chips. The tomatillo....lacking. It had a pretty viscous consistency and I didn't enjoy it very much at all. Topped with a bit of Cholula and it was passable. There are a few different salsas. I'm looking forward to trying them all. 

Tacos. Hmm where to start other th....AMAZING. Dude. Seriously. The tortillas are textbook. Flour tortillas were choice du jour and are lightly fried, puffy, housing a slight crunch and retains a light chew throughout. I'd like to lobby for a take-home pack of these tortillas, por favor. Went with the pablano shrimp tacos. Sign me up. Every time. Smoky pablanos, chipotle cream, slaw, spicy shrimp. I didn't want them to end. Your order can consist of two or three tacos. I went with two and it was plenty for an entree. 

Tempura avocado tacos. Umm...vegetarians should be lining the block for these. I was astonished at the flavor(s). I may order these again for myself. Great job, fellas. 

Sides. Mexican Street Corn. I repeat, MEXICAN STREET CORN. Just go look at the photo I posted. Stellar execution. Try it. Thank me later. Repeat. 

Black beans and rice. They were A-OK. Flavor was rather pungent but a nice rounded side for tacos. 

Price point is fair, staff was suuuuper friendly, and the location is great. Only real problem, which I'm sure all could commiserate on, is the parking issue. We walked since we live in the neighborhood, but the parking situation is abysmal. Garage parking, some street parking, or snag a space at an adjacent business and pray not to get towed. Maybe that vacant lot can turn into something in the future? Hmmm...

Synopsis: We'll be back. Very soon. (For more of those tacos, no doubt)

Cheers and welcome to the neighborhood, Longboards!

Ever since the Bellagio opened up on the Strip, their buffet was generally the best in my eyes.  Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.

Now, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!

What's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.

The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  

The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  

We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  

No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.

There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:

- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  

- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.

- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  

- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.

- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!

- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!

3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.

Absolutely nothing else exudes such opulence, over-the top luxury, and sheer bliss like The Spa at Encore. From the second you step out of the elevator on the spa floor, you are immediately immersed in a mini-paradise of a "lobby." I've been there a solid 8 -10 times now and am still completely captivated by every little detail of the place. 

This review is not only for the facilities (easily 5 stars), but for the even more amazing and unrivaled spa treatments. First things first, let's start with the flawless facilities.

With purchase of a treatment, facilities are included-- otherwise, I believe it is $40 for a day pass. TIP: Friday and Saturday, only Wynn/Encore hotel guests can purchase a day pass (the treatments are fair game, though). 
Once you somehow stop marveling at the beautiful lobby, you are taken into your respective gender's spa area and are given sandals, a drink of choice (any juice and water) and are taken to your user-friendly, electronic locker with a super soft, plush robe. The locker area is large and spacious and is hardly ever crowded. 

--Sauna: Hasn't been consistent when I've been, but is typically just right. Two levels for seating. 
--Steam Room: VERY hot and impossible to see two inches in front of you. I can stay in 5-10 minute increments in here. Also two levels for seating.

--Then, enter the jacuzzi/whirlpool room. This is another large, spacious room with two rather oversized jacuzzi pools....probably 20x7 or so in size. Next to that is a "cool plunge" that is ~80 degrees I believe, so completely bearable. And, adjacent to this is a "cold plunge." What an incredible shock to the body this is when switching between the hot jacuzzi and this whirlpool. Invigorating, but borderline miserable for the first few minutes! 

--On the right side of the room sit around 7 contouring, warmed, ever-so-slightly vibrating tile-inlay stone chairs. These are similar to the ones at Qua (Caesar's) but are even better. I've been guilty of a nap on these! 

--On the left side are waterfall showers and "Experimental Showers;" the waterfall ones are just that-- they dump a TON of water on you at one time in that waterfall arch. They are extremely good for a minor massage on the shoulders/scalp and after jumping out of the whirlpools. The other showers have several options to play with, including water temp, lighting of the shower, pressure, which shower heads emit water (there are so many!), and even themed experiences (rain forest, thunderstorm, sunrise, etc...). Kind of a ploy, but very neat and it's pretty entertaining for a bit. 

NOW, FOR THE MAIN ACT....

The spa treatments. I've been privileged enough to try two different treatments here on multiple occasions: 
--The 50-minute Fusion Massage (traditional Swedish type of massage).
--The 80-minute Good Luck Ritual (50 minute Fusion Massage, followed by a scalp massage with Wild Lime Blossom Oil and then a hand/arm/foot treatment with peppermint/lemon exfoliating scrub, then wrapped in hot towel booties and then a follow-up lotion treatment). Since I've had this, I can't go back to 50 minute massage..this one is just too good!

TIP TIP TIP!!! 
--The first therapist I ever had at Encore was Liana Poet. Some advice...REQUEST HER. I honestly cannot tell you how absolutely incredible her treatments are...you cannot go wrong with whatever treatment you choose to have with her. I've had so many different massage therapists in my life and she is DEFINITELY not one to be missed. Unfortunately, she isn't there on weekends, but an extremely suitable alternate is Kassi Sillin. If Liana isn't available, request Kassi. Both of them are incredibly talented with their professions and are exceptional assets to the spa. 

I know this has been an extensive and drawn-out review, but it is just a testament to how much I love this slice of paradise. I feel like a king every time I set foot here and wish that everyone could experience it. While I do like Qua's facilities a lot, too, Encore's Spa is by far my favorite spa I've ever been to-- both in Vegas and beyond.
Quick condensing: Get the Good Luck Ritual with Liana Poet and spend hours in glam facilities. It is worth every single penny.

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

Any Asian owned business that has the word "Spa" in its name will raise suspicions of being a "rub and tug."  Being a member of law enforcement,  I have to be extra vigilant about the businesses I patronize.  Imperial Health Spa was recommended to me by several female friends and after some research on Yelp, I felt it was an legitimate spa and made an appointment.

The spa layout is pretty simple unless you're gender-confused.  It is located in a two story building and divided into three areas; the top floor is the co-ed area and the bottom is segregated by gender. 

Before I go any further, I must warn you...  DO NOT go if you are not comfortable with same-sex full frontal nudity.  There will be naked people there and they will walk as if they are strolling in the park.  If you have a hang up about being naked, don't go, because if I catch you checking out my junk, I'm gonna kick your butt--and two naked dudes fighting in a spa is the last thing ANYONE wants to see.

When you arrive, you will be checked in by the receptionist, it costs $15 for locals and $20 for non-locals to use the facilities (Mani, Pedi, Facial, Massages, Exfols services are also available at extra cost).  You will be given a set of shorts,  hospital scrubs, 2 towels and a key.  The key is for your locker, the rest, hopefully, are self explanatory.

When you walk into the changing area, there will be mini-lockers, those mini-lockers are for your shoes.  You are now faced with a couple of decisions, put your shoes in the mini shoe locker or your key locker; and use the slippers in the mini shoe locker or go bare foot.  You're an adult, figure it out.

There will be lockers and the number on your key will correspond to the locker.  Get out of your street clothes,  wrap a towel around yourself, hit the showers.  In the segregated area, there will be:

Stand-up Showers
Sit-down Asian Showers
Hot Tub
Cool Tub
Salt Steam Room
Herbal Steam Room
Dry Sauna
Salt Hot Sauna

PLEASE SHOWER AFTER YOU VISIT EACH AREA... shower/hot tub/shower/steam room/shower/cave/shower/sauna... and any combination thereof, just shower after each "area."

The upstairs is the co-ed area, it consists of a general lounge area with big comfy lazy-boy chairs where you can watch TV and a mini-restaurant that serves basic Korean/Asian food as well as some boba/smoothie drinks.  Upstairs specialty rooms are as follows:

Salt Brick Room - A hot room with salt bricks
Red Clay Ball Sauna - Think kitty litter, for humans, without the poo.
Jade Sauna - Not sure what this room was for and didn't bother to read the sign, just remember it being hot
Red Clay Room- It's a red clay igloo... also hot.
Cold Room - Basically a walk in freezer
Mini Gym - I don't exercise, so I avoided this room.  I think there were treadmills and stationary bikes.

I got the combo package of "Pure Heaven" which consisted of a Body Scrub, Swedish Massage and Fresh Grated Cucumber Mask (70 minutes, $130).  The scrub was great, left my skin baby soft.  The cucumber mask made me hungry.  The massage was okay.  

I took one star away for the fact that I didn't have a choice of getting a female therapist... becuase I got the body scrub, the entire package had to be done by a middle-age Korean man.  I was told that if I wanted a female therapist, I should have separated out the massage and body rub; wherein the exfoliation would be done by a man and the massage portion, a woman.  Fine, next time I know.

I did enjoy the Tofu soup at the restaurant ($9.00)... which was prepared by a woman.

All in all, it's a pretty good experience, relaxing after having to deal with my crazy mother.

***Like a lot of Vegas restaurants, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is expensive, but the food is very nicely plated and delicious (contemporary food but also tried and true flavor combinations)***

I went to the L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Tokyo two years ago and I had a very good experience so I decided to give the Vegas location a try.  The restaurants are fairly similar.  They both feature very similar decors (sharp reds against dark blacks to give the restaurant a very modern and trendy feel).  Both restaurants also feature bar seating around the open kitchen (a great view of the talented chefs at work).

There are other similarities.  Both locations feature a lot of modern dishes--whether available as small plates or in a seasonal tasting menu.

There are differences as well.  The Tokyo location is much bigger.  The Tokyo location also takes pastry very seriously.  The bread at the Vegas location is decent, but it does not compare that well to the Tokyo location.  The Tokyo location even has a high-end patisserie on site, which features upscale French pastries as well as individual cakes/desserts.

The food was very good at both locations though I probably liked the food at the Vegas location more.  The Tokyo location seemed more representative of the country's cuisine though.  The restaurant featured a lot of Japanese ingredients--whether Japanese fish, Japanese raised beef or mushrooms.  The menu at the Vegas location felt like a menu you might see anywhere.

I went with the tasting menu at the Vegas location and almost everything was very good.  I also added their crispy langoustine as an additional item.  Here is a rundown on their tasting menu.

(Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan) This was okay though I wish the foie gras taste was stronger.

(Confit of mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a radish cannelloni) The flavors were simple and light, but I liked the varying textures and flavors as well as the presentation.

(Poached oysters with chive migonenette) These were good.  The oysters were warm and soft while the dressing was flavorful.

(Langoustines with green curry and coconut milk) These were exceptional.  The langoustines were sweet and very moist (also very soft).  The garnishes were not that strong, which allowed the flavor of the langoustines to really shine.

(White onion tart topped with smoked applewood bacon, quail egg, parmesan, and asparagus) This was kind of a take on breakfast.  I really liked the crispy (hash brown-like) onion tart as well as the rich yolk of the quail egg.  I thought the bacon could have been crispier.

(Crispy langoustine fritter, basil pesto, salad) I ordered this as an additional course.  The crispy shell of the fritter was good--light, crispy and not greasy.  The basil leaf tucked inside the shell also gave the fritter a nice fragrance.  The langoustine was also good (moist), but it did not have the sweetness or softness of the other langoustine dish.

(John Dory, baby leeks, tomato, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger, pomme puree) This was small but good.  The John Dory was moist and light (though the fish still had a good flavor).  I liked the mix of the butter sauce with the creamy, buttery pomme puree and the fresh tomato and leek salsa.

(Foie gras stuffed quail, pomme puree, herb salad with truffle vinaigrette) Though the foie gras stuffing was just okay, the quail was very good.  It was nicely caramelized and had a great sweet and crispy sear as well as juicy meat.  The sauce was rich and good.  I really liked the herb salad--great freshness and fragrant herbs, much better than micro greens (the also strong in flavor truffle vinaigrette was a great pairing).

(Caramel panna cotta, lemon cookie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries) I really liked the panna cotta--smooth and creamy with a very good caramel flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was great--smooth and dense with a great old-fashioned vanilla bean flavor.

(Berry mousse, tender chocolate cake, blackberries, banana tuile) This was a standard fruit with chocolate dessert.  The mousse was creamy and the chocolate cake (pieces) was not dry but just okay.  I really liked the light tuile, which had a noticeable banana flavor.

Prices were high though the tasting menu seemed to be a much better value than going a la carte.

Service was decent.  Not super attentive and plates lingered a little bit though the food came out relatively fast.  The staff was pleasant.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon features very contemporary and artfully designed food, but there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The restaurant focuses on classical flavor combinations (whether from France or other countries/regions), which should please many.  There are a lot of overpriced fine dining spots in Vegas.  L'Atelier is expensive as well, but at least the food is delicious and very memorable.

MGM Grand offers free self-parking (via a structure).

I'm writing my review of the operation for San Diego, but, as far as I know, all the local operations use the same Vegas address. Fun fact: I had to submit a question on the website to get an actual address emailed to me. I think it goes without saying that the company does this intentionally probably so that it can avoid criticism on sites such as Yelp. I.e., this is why, as far as I know, I am the first person to write a review of the business.

I purchased a year-long membership for 2 off of a deal site in October, 2011. Prior to doing so, I had emailed the listed contact person to inquire what kinds of free tickets I could expect. She replied that she couldn't say because she wanted to protect the identities of their entertainment partners. That is, if word got out to the general public that show tickets were being given away freely, who would pay the full price? On the surface, this makes sense, except that anyone familiar with the internet knows that I could just do a search and see what other members were seeing. That said, given that Fillaseat's service had just arrived in San Diego and overall lack of Yelp reviews, I had to go by forum posts concerning the Las Vegas outfit. Which meant Musicals! Concerts! Etc.! And I'm comfortable enough with my masculinity that I can admit that I adore musicals.

Based on the example of Vegas, I bought the deal, thinking that two concerts or one musical might cover the initial cost, and everything after that would be gravy. And for the first month or so of my membership, I thought I had found a bargain. In that first month, I saw tickets for a Foo Fighters show, Kyuss Lives!, and the Scorpions. (You had to front $10 extra to get the latter.) I didn't actually go to any of those, because I wasn't free, but still it looked promising. In fact, when other San Diegans posted messages in the Yelp forums, asking whether they should themselves get memberships, I spoke well of the offerings.

But then, as far as I could tell, Fillaseat stopped trying. Pretty much the only tickets they offered were for comedy clubs, which some of the Yelp commenters suggested might already be free. Either way, if going to comedy clubs is your thing, great. I don't hate stand-up, but it's not my first choice, and it would have been nice to have had more variety during my year of membership. Although I guess I might have enjoyed the antique shows. And there were other concerts (most notably at 4th and B) that I didn't have an opportunity to attend, but they were needles in the proverbial haystack. Often times, when there were interesting events, the available tickets would be snatched up well before I could even log-on.

All in all, during the entire year, I only went to two events using my Fillaseat membership. The first, ironically, was a comedy show--Jon Lovitz. Because it was Jon Lovitz. And the second was for San Diego *something* *something* Dance Company. I didn't do enough research on that, apparently, because the show was filled with teens and pre-teens. 1. That was awkward. And 2. As much as the show wasn't terrible, Fillaseat providing tickets to see non-professionals was pretty tacky.

Summary: Your mileage may vary, but likely not worth it if you're not a huge stand-up fan.

***Aria's Julian Serrano is a nice looking tapas spot with a menu that sounds good; unfortunately, the food was surprisingly mediocre***

Julian Serrano is a tapas spot that is near the front lobby of the Aria Hotel.  The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.

The decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).

We had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.

Here is a rundown on what we had.

(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).

There was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.

(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).

(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.

(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.

(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.

(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).

Service was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).

I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.

Julian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.

Aria features complimentary valet parking.  I am not sure if they feature complimentary self-parking as well.

I was involved in a car accident on March 8th while out of state. The car made it back home to Vegas and my insurance company wasted no time picking the car up from my house and taking it for repair. My insurance company chose Caliber Collision for repair.

After almost 2 weeks of Caliber Collision having my car I wondered what the heck was taking so long for them to finish. The car was dropped off to Caliber on March 11th. I was told that my car would be ready on March 21st. I called on the 21st just to confirm it would really be done since they had changed their story so many times before and I was assured that my car only needed to be buffed in one area and something else put back on so it would for sure be ready a couple hours from the time I called and that I could take my car rental back.

After arriving at Caliber I was told my car was FAR from finished. I was furious since I had returned the rental and was promised that it was finished. My hubby snapped some pics of the car and it needed paint and several parts still replaced. I was told that they got behind and it would for sure be ready the following day on the 22nd.

So, on March 22nd I show up at Caliber Collision ready to pick up my car and it still isn't done!!!!! An employee for Caliber who said he was in charge of overseeing the repair of our car just stood there next to our car with lie after lie after lie coming out of his mouth about this whole ordeal. He was the one who the day before said the car just needed some buffing and something put back on. I can't even list everything still wrong with the car or what Caliber scratched a broke while pretending to fix my car because yelp would give me a character limit for sure so I will cover just some of it.

- Over spray of paint near tires.
- When they replaced the passenger side door it was painted but not well. It has a primer look to it. Returning a car to someone that you didn't even finish painting is lazy.
- Replaced the wrong hubcap even though the paperwork told them which one to replace. The employee told me he made the judgment call himself on which one to replace even though the paperwork said what one to change. 
- The passenger door that was replaced pushed up over the car. WTH do you think I, as well other people wont notice a car door that is higher then the rest of the car??!?!?!?! 
- There were gaps in several very obvious spots where the car just didn't line up.
- Electric locks were broken
- Side mirror broken
- There was still BLOOD in the back seat of my car!!!! W-T-H!!!!!!!!!..... The car accident took place during a heavy snowstorm and 3 cars were involved. We (hubby & me) were the only people not seriously injured. Another car had a passenger that was very badly hurt and since we had the only running car with a heater, we were asked if she could sit in our car. We of course said yes because no human being with a heart would leave someone bleeding and with the injuries she had on the side of a cold snowy road that had no visible street lights. The injured girl had her boyfriend with her and he got into the car as well. They left blood every where. It didn't really bother me at first because it was an accident none of us could predict and people do bleed. What did bother me is that the insurance company was billed for the car being detailed and it was filthier inside then when it was originally dropped off to them. I have no idea how any person lives or treats their body but how I care for my own body and don't want to get sick or my dog who rides in the backseat and is bound to smell the blood and lick it to get sick. I do know after so many days and a certain temperature dried blood might not get you sick but would you really take the risk? I refuse to. This was disgusting and absolutely not acceptable. 

I could keep going on but think you get the drift. When the guy was showing us the car on the 22nd and actually said while looking right at the car, that it was ready I just couldn't believe it. After we pointed out all of the stuff he admitted that they didn't do a full check of the car (duh!) and were very busy trying to get other vehicles done. I told him that telling us it was done and lying over and over wasn't cutting it with me and that I wanted him to pay for another rental and to fix my car right. He had the nerve to let us leave in our broken ass car with dried blood all over the backseat and told us to come back when we weren't busy next week so they could look at it. SMH again, hubby decided the car needed to go to their Henderson location to see if they could get our car fixed like it was supposed to. I would never ever ever ever ever ever bring your vehicle to Caliber Collision!

Hubby said it best when he said "it looks like an 8th grade mechanic shop that was blind put our car back together".

I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks. 

Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like. 

Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to "Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.

Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.

Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes! 

I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!

Any place that rewards my check-in with a tasty on-the-house Sangria is A-OK with me!  Especially since I would have checked-in regardless.  We had 8:30 reservations on a Saturday.  When we got there, there were a few tables open in this hip Cuban style restaurant.  Our waitress greeted us quickly and supplied our Sangrias within 5 minutes.  She inquired if we were ready and I said I needed a minute.  She left to attend to a much bigger party, and we were quickly greeted by another server who explained he would be helping because she was taking care of a bachelorette party.  He described the menu, how ceviche is made and was very informative.  However, when he left our original waitress appeared as the party table was wrapping up, I am guessing to go party a little more hardy... 

I decided I wanted to try the Fire and Ice Seviche with salmon.  She kind of shuttered, and said most people don't choose that with the F&I... Ok I love getting suggestions from the servers... She said most like crab or Ahi Tuna... Well then I will go with the crab... It was fabulous... I loved the balance of heat and citrus and herbs to cool it down.  Definitely a winner.   The drink I decided on next was a Manhattan featuring Wigle Whisky, holy snikes, it was almost as much as my main meal!  It was good, had a punch, but I couldn't blow the whole budget on cocktails!  Or could I??

Next we both got a trio of taco's.  My husband went with BBQ Short ribs tacos, were as I played mix and match and got one BBQ Short rib, on Baja Fish, and one BLT.  We both really enjoyed the BBQ Short Rib taco but it was such a small amount of fillings in the shell.  The shell stood a good inch above where the filling ended.  Kind of disappointing there.  My Baja Fish was really tasty but it was a little dry.  It needed an aioli or slaw something.  Good flavor, just needed a boost.  The last taco, the BLT was by far my favorite.  Filled to the top with the pickled veg and romaine, and the pork belly boats sat on top.  I call them boats because they were big strips not bite sized cuts which I thought was way better than cutting them up.  The prices on our tacos were not bad but since the short rib one was so skimpy my husband was still quite hungry, so I talked him into getting dessert... HA!  Yea like someone really needs to talk him into dessert; ) He ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  It was good and he enjoyed it but it was a bit pricey for the size.  And unfortunately he left hungry.  I on the other hand was satisfied so I can't complain and I am sure we will be back to sample some other dishes.

From acclaimed Michelin star steakhouses to the trendiest gastropubs, from AYCE buffets to authentic Asian food, Vegas has a ton of restaurants. 

Unfortunately, almost all of these restaurants are not dog-friendly. I even heard that you can't walk dogs on the Strip because they wanted to keep the peddlers and their dogs off Las Vegas Boulevard. 

Therefore, trying to find a dog-friendly restaurant will require you to leave the Strip and head over to the more residential areas of Vegas. Perusing the Yelp app, that is how the wife and I stumbled upon Honey Salt, a glorious restaurant in the Summerlin part of northwest Las Vegas that feels like Palm Springs, CA... complete with wealthy white people and golf courses.

Like morons, we decided to do a late lunch with our four-legged son, Charlie, in the hot desert that encompasses Las Vegas. Blame our stupidity or the fact that we are so used to taking him around with us everywhere in Southern California that we did not realize how fucking hot it gets in Las Vegas. That is why when we arrived at Honey Salt, their spacious patio was empty. However, almost immediately, one of their workers, Mauro, came out and set up a patio umbrella for us to shade us from the hot desert sun. I'm sure he was thinking, stupid tourists! 

As we were waiting for the umbrella to be set up, our mindful server, Louis, brought out a bowl of water filled with ice cubes for Charlie! He even brought out two glasses and a pitcher of ice water for the dumb humans! First impressions go a long way and we were definitely impressed. 

We ended up ordering two of the "Family Favorites" off their lunch menu. The Mary's Free Range Chicken ($15) and the Ahi Tuna Salad ($17). 

The Mary's Free Range Chicken is served with red and white quinoa, beluga lentils, shaved fennel, radish, avocado chunks, and a citrus vinaigrette. While the chicken was very good, the grains definitely stole the show. This hearty conception was delicious and the citrus vinaigrette made it really refreshing. True to their name the citrus vinaigrette provided the "honey" and the grains provided the "salt".

The Ahi Tuna Salad was equally amazing. Yes, the wasabi pea and ginger crusted ahi tuna was great and the baby spinach with cream soy vinaigrette was delicious. However, the real star was the sea beans and julienned Asian pears salad mixed in what was a sesame kind of sauce. This single salad had both "honey" from the sweet Asian pears and "salt" from the sea beans. Freaking awesome.

All in all, the service and the fresh farm-to-table food was really impressive. It's definitely a hidden gem in the Las Vegas desert. Next time the family is in Vegas, we will wait for the sun to go down so that Mauro won't have to break a sweat for us.

* The complimentary Parmesan crisps served with honey butter were very addicting and they have an extensive beer selection.

* Honey Salt is located in the inconspicuous Rampart Commons shopping center with a Chico's, Gap, and Pottery Barn at the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston. If exiting the Rampart exit off the Summerlin Parkway, the shopping center will be on the right.

* Honey Salt must be doing something right because they will be opening up another restaurant in the Summerlin area!

They've only been open a few weeks, but Kitchen 18 is already doing a fabulous job with their (kosher) food, service, and ambiance.  

I went to meet some girlfriends for dinner the other night, and we all were delighted to see that the place was jammed.  Lucky for us, there was one table open when we arrived, and it seemed to have our name on it!  The hostess was friendly as was our server, and we were impressed by the wide selection on the menu.  None of us keep kosher, but we were intrigued that there were plenty of fresh and healthy options.  

We started with the hummus appetizer to share and we also tried the salami and fig bruschetta.  The hummus was a tad on the bland side, but I loved that they served it with warm fluffy pita (white and wheat) and delicious pickles and peppers too.  The bruschetta was tasty... I can't compare it to Postino (my fave place for bruschetta) as you can't possibly compare kosher salami bruschetta to something quite the opposite, but it was good.

For our entrees, I had the Israeli salad with schwarma and really enjoyed it.  It was a large portion, so I boxed half of it to take home, but it was colorful, filling, and seasoned just right. One of my friends had the sliders and the other went with steak, which they both enjoyed.  Oh, and I ate more than a few of the sweet potato fries that came with the steak - they were delicious!

We shared a tiramisu dessert which didn't disappoint, even being dairy free!  (The kitchen happens to be entirely dairy free, so don't ask for a cheese burger when you go!)

I love that the attached market stays open late, so I did a little bit of shopping after our meal.  I highly recommend a product they carry called "popcorners."  They are popped corn chips and totally addicting!  There are tons of other unique kosher food items at the market too and an entire jewish gift shop as well (which I believe is in the process of being remodeled).

I look forward to returning to Kitchen 18 again soon... It's moderately priced and conveniently located on the Southeast corner of Scottsdale and Shea.  Whether you're keeping kosher, trying to eat healthy, or none of the above, there is something for everyone on the menu.

Shout out to Nelson Q for having a good eye and letting me know this business opened today! I got myself down here about 30 minutes after the heads up.. Dedicated!

I arrived expecting this to be the chain that's based out of Hawaii. Unfortunately, this is independently owned, and not at all like the Bale that I'm used to back home, but that's where my disappointment ends. The owner, seeing my sad expression enthusiastically told me that it's much better than the place I was looking for. That's a lot to live up to, since I have childhood memories of pate banh mi.

I came knowing I was going to order a pate sandwich, but didn't see it on the menu. Upon asking, they told me they could make me a pate sandwich and asked if I wanted it with or without butter. I opted for no butter, letting the pate do it's own rich thing.

The sandwich was huge and only $2! Not sure if this is regular pricing or grand opening pricing seeing as all the other banh mi are $3.45- which, on it's own, is pretty competitive for Vegas.
The bread is crusty and crisp on the outside while light and buttery on the inside- perfect! Way better than Mr. Sandwich and on par with Dakao. The vegetables were just right and cut the richness from the smear of chicken pate which was actually minimally applied. The cilantro provided that herbal kick that I love so dearly. Jalapeos for heat. Sriracha because.. Well.. It's Sriracha, and every table is equipped with it. Based on the bread and veggies alone, this is a major banh mi contender on the LV China Town strip.

They offer a lot of soups and deli items as well, though the sandwich was just right for me and I was unable to bring myself to sample anything else.

And nice plus was the hot jasmine tea they brought me when I sat down, brewed just right and not bitter. 

Update!: after speaking with the owner, he also owns Dakao up the road, but he says he likes the bread better here because they have a different oven. =)

Given the room we were in I think 3 stars is about right, had we been in a better updated room then I could imagine it being 4.

The rooms were ok, nothing special but they were a place to sleep which is really all we wanted for our 2 night stay. My Husband booked 2 rooms via his Perks subscription for us and his Family to stay in. The rooms were on the small side and really dark inside, they really had seen better days too. Paint was chipped and housekeeping wasn't overly enthusiastic in regards to the dusting but the location was perfect. We were on the 21st floor which has some nice views and was quiet, what I really didn't like was there was only one working Ice Machine for the entire floor, I had to walk right around to the other side of the building in my PJ's twice to fill up a tiny little bucket.

Britney happened to be performing on the 2nd night that we stayed and thought it nice that they place her pictures up around the elevator area, not so cool when fans are holding up the line to get one while posing and taking pictures though. Maybe have a designated area for this sort of thing?
The casino downstairs is pretty big and there is a great selection of shops and eateries, I LOVED the fact that Gordon Ramsay Burger was in the same building. The Miracle Mile shops is also a huge bonus too.

Check in was easy once we got through the 30 minute wait in line.

This review is long overdue. The first business I dealt with when I was buying a house in Las Vegas was Bugsy's Blinds and it was a great experience. I found Bugsy's on Yelp and Yelp did not disappoint. Aside from the reviews, Bugsy's had way more options than the other companies, could deliver them quicker and at better prices so that's why I decided to go with them. 

I was buying a house that didn't have a single blind or shutter. I had temporary paper blinds shielding my house from the hot Vegas sun throughout. That was a situation that needed to be rectified immediately so I called up Bugsy's and they matched me up with Rafael. He became in charge of my account. I communicated to him via text messages and we got the whole process going before I had even closed escrow. Rafael was easy to get a hold of and went the extra mile to help me, which I'll admit, I needed a little extra help than normal because I still lived in NYC at the time.

Rafael knew that I didn't want to be without window coverings for a long period of time. I like my sleep in the mornings and waking up at 5 am when the sun comes up was not something I was looking forward to. Bugsy's was sensitive to that fact and he assured me that they would take care of me and get me my blinds as quickly as humanly possible. Rafael was great to deal with from start to finish. Bugsy's Blinds got the job done right on time, just as Rafael had promised. He even recommended a great trainer whom I've been working out with ever since. I really appreciated that extra personal touch, as I was new to town and didn't know very many people. 

I recommend Bugsy's without any hesitation. The blinds/shutters that they made for my house are very high quality and beautiful. For the quality of that I received, I got a great deal! There were some minor modifications that needed to be done to one of my shutters and they did it expeditiously without any additional charges. 

I was so happy with my experience with their company that I decided to hire them to add solar shades to my bedroom doors. This saves you money on your energy bill as well as makes it blackout dark so you can really get your zzzzz's on. Last I heard, Bugsy's was going to start doing unbreakable glass in addition to all the other services they offer. I will probably be hiring them again to add this security feature to my home in the near future.

***Lotus of Siam is a very good Thai restaurant and easily the best value I've ever had in Vegas, which is filled with overpriced and mediocre restaurants***

Lotus of Siam is a very well respected Thai restaurant in Las Vegas (it recently won a James Beard award).  The restaurant is off The Strip but not too far away.  The restaurant is located in a deserted kind of strip mall and has a no frills decor, but it is nice enough.  The restaurant is clean and has warm colors (the walls are outfitted with many photos--I guess with pictures of celebrities though I did not take a close look).  The restaurant is also bigger than I expected and was very busy (luckily, we had reservations).

The menu at Lotus of Siam is huge.  There is an unbelievable number of dishes and they range from all kinds of proteins (beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, many kinds of fish) to many different types (soups, salads, noodles, appetizers, and so on).  We tried several things.  Here is the rundown.

(Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and served with sweet and sour sauce).  The chicken wings were moist and flavorful as well as crispy (and not greasy).  The sauce was thin and mostly sweet.

(Tom Yum Kung hot and sour soup with shrimp, lime juice, lemongrass, and straw mushrooms) The soup had a strong citrus flavor as well as good fragrance from the fresh herbs.  There was a very generous portion of shrimp, which were plump and moist.  The soup was surprisingly spicy and left quite the tingling on the tongue.

(Thai Beef salad with onion, tomato, chili, lime juice, and greens) I liked this one more than my friends, who were surprised by its lack of salad-ness.  The salad was mostly a stir fry, but the meat was nicely cooked and had a good flavor.  I liked the lime flavor as well as the moistness of the plate.

(Charbroiled prawns with garlic black pepper sauce) The prawns were big, moist and tender.  The garlic black pepper sauce was good and not too overpowering.

(Pad Thai with chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, and chopped peanut and Thai fried rice with shrimp, egg, onion, and tomato) Their Pad Thai and their fried rice were the only disappointing dishes of the night.  The noodles were too soft and clumped together too much.  The other ingredients were fine, but the overall flavor was nothing special compared to other Thai spots I've tried.  The same could be said for their fried rice.

(Crispy duck with chili, mint leaves and Thai basil) The duck was very good--moist but with a great crispy and crunchy outside batter.  The garnishes were flavorful and fragrant.

(Braised beef short rib panang with a red cream curry sauce and cognac) The creamy sauce was great--great flavor and incredible fragrance.  The short rib was just okay.  While mostly tender, the short rib varied from kind of dry in some parts to too fatty in other parts.

(Fried banana rolls) I liked the very egg roll-like wrapper (crispy, thin and not too sweet).  The banana was sweet and good.  I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional.

(Coconut ice cream) The ice cream had a good flavor and was creamy, but it was a little sorbet like.

Service was friendly, but it did take a while for us to put in our order.  The first dishes took a little bit of time to come out and I wished that our second run of dishes would have been spaced apart more (too much came out at the same time).

Prices were very good.  Given the quality and the fact that Lotus of Siam is in Vegas, the meal was easily the best bang-for-your-buck meal I've ever had in Vegas.

While I am not that experienced with Thai food, I really enjoyed Lotus of Siam.  Many of the dishes were good.  Since Las Vegas has so many overpriced restaurants, it was very refreshing to try a place like Lotus of Siam where you could spend less but not sacrifice in terms of quality.  If I was ever in Vegas again with a big group and needed a satisfying but also reasonably priced dinner, we would definitely head to Lotus of Siam.

The strip mall has a huge and free parking lot.

If you're from a Tier1 city on the East or West coast, this city is a major fail.  If you come from, say, Chattanooga, TN, or anywhere equally as appalling such as anywhere in-between Philly and Los Angeles, this city will probably be a step up for you.

PROS:
----------
Friendly people.  Beautiful sunsets.  Beautiful desert scenery.  Cheap rent.  Beautiful weather 6mos out of the year.  Pretty decent Magic the Gathering scene.  Wonderful family.  

CONS:
-----------
A big percentage of people here are radical Christians and loony Mormons waiting for their spaceship to the planet Kolob (look it up).

There are a lot of chain restaurants and you've really got to search high and low for decent eats.  Unfortunately, most Phonecians enjoy Applebees over, say, a great Cajun eatery. 

The music scene is laughable, at best.  When the weekend's headline event is "Hardcore is a Girl's Best Friend", and when you go to a desert party with 2 stages of Hardcore, you know you're in trouble.  The city's DnB weekly draws crowds in the single-digits, and most events, sound-wise, are utter failures.  For instance, bringing out a huge UK DnB DJ then having the sound cutting out and clipping all night, awesome!  Want to hear Glitch?  bawahaha, good luck.  How about DubStep?  woooo!  If you're lucky you can catch the DubStep _monthly_... yes folks, 1x's a month.  Awesome.  There is literally only one weekly that's worth anything and it's the Pound which has been going strong for 1yr.  Sadly, you see the same 100 people at every event worth anything.  So in a city of 5million or whatever, 100 people know and support good music.  *sigh*  Want to hear a sick DJ like DJ Dan, Donald Gladue, DJ Icey, etc....?  Well you have 1 option:  wade through the sea of douchebaggery at Myst filled with the worst of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale wanna-be's with their $200 jeans and $150 bling t-shirts with no clue that a world-class DJ is on the decks.... THEN, you will be sadly disappointed as you watch your favorite DJ spin a watered-down set on a shitty sound system.  Sweet.

Art?  "Hellz yeah we have First Friday".  Yeah, 1x's a month, there's something artsy to do.  Tits.

Public transportation?  Yeah, the people of The Valley voted for the Light Rail project... a BILLION dollar debacle which provides Phonecians a single route from Mesa up to Phoenix, at a cost of $2.50 for a r/t.  Is it cheaper than driving?  No.  Faster than driving?  Nah.  More convenient?  Nope.  Does it go anywhere useful?  Naw.  It serves only a tiny fraction of our population, mainly those that find it "hip" to live in Downtown Phoenix.  How about the bus?  Don't know, I've never seen a bus in Gilbert.

Weather?  Miserable... you are forced to live in an artificial environment 6months out of the year because it's too hot to have a window open, too hot to even go outside.  Sure there's a lot of nice outdoors activities, but you can only participate 1/2 the year.   Don't let people fool you and tell you "it's a dry heat".  I don't care if it's dry or not, 117 degrees is 117 degrees.  OH, and don't expect it to cool down at night.... 100 degrees at MIDNIGHT is actually common.  And btw, it's not always a "dry heat"... most of the summer is Monsoon season.  You actually begin to look forward to the monsoons.

How does Phoenix's weather effect your body?  Well, if you enjoy not being able to breathe, sneezing, watery eyes, bloody noses, burning your flesh on your leather seats, Valley Fever, and respiratory issues, Phoenix is the place for you!

Job market?  Awesome, if you enjoy working for a call center.

Cops?  Super!  We've got the anti-Constitution, racial profiling, show-boating, murdering Joe Arpaio.  If you are caught with even a roach or a stem of weed, you're looking at a trip to Tent City where you can enjoy our 117 degree weather from the comfort of an outside bunk bed under a canvas tent.  If you're brown and working hard to support your family, expect for your place of business to be raided, and for you to be arrested and detained, probably even deported.

Drivers?  The drivers in Phoenix are fascinating to watch and observe.  They paint the perfect picture of mental retardation.  Everyone tailgates here, going 70mph.  I defy anyone to drive 20miles on our freeway systems and not see a rear-end accident.  Multiple rear-end accidents happen daily.  Why?  Because people drive at 70mph literally inches from the car in front of them.  Now any person with an IQ over 70 would be able to understand that if the car in front of them has to stop suddenly, you are guaranteed to get into an accident.  GUARANTEED.  I am baffled and literally astounded at the fact that no one seems to understand that out here.

FINALLY, a place for hipster wannabes from Assfucklandia to circle jerk!!!  It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long, downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks, get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????

I'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism, but on the whole, progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure, it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind, I swear.

I bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours, I ain't biting it no more.

So many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio, but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled "upstairs" drinks, so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available, so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete, without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for "mixology" drinks, at least make 'em right!! 

The other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here, trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!

Speaking of the DJ, he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type, but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut, Coke-bottle glasses and stringy, balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown/secret child molester than your average DJ, and for that I give him MAJOR props.

I actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place, so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz, asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell, I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!

Over hyped. There I said it. Don't be hating, I just wasn't blown away and after seeing words like ''amazing'', ''exceptional'' and ''spectacular'' appearing in so many reviews I did expect more than the very average tasting Chicken and Waffles I had. Ok, portions are huge but that is the exact reason why America has an obesity problem. Half the portions, increase the quality and you're onto a winner Hash House.

Located inside The Quad this place is a bitch to find. It's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.
Once inside the place is large and the staff inviting. The menu consists of Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner with your usual American fare. Knowing from the Yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one Entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.

- Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=WMlwV0h4FJ210s5htktfYg#qbOfWBSEnFvS3S5Kvu9uBA) The Waffles have Bacon cooked into them and comes with Leeks. The presentation was great, piled high and held together with a huge steak knife, truly a beast of a meal.
My Husband and I found the Chicken to be a little dry and the coating oily. It also had a strong flour taste where too much had been used before the egg wash and crumb coating. The Waffles and Syrup were good if you took out the Bacon (consisted of more fat than meat) and the Leeks really added nothing to the dish, do people even eat them?
The portion was large enough for Breakfast between two of us though as we didn't even manage to finish it, how one person could eat that much in one sitting is beyond me.

Bottom line? Disappointing experience, I'm glad I did come here after wanting to for so long but am not likely to return. I guess it's the kind of place you come once just to say you have been. 

Probably more 2.5 / 5. I'm too generous...

I wish I could give this place 6-stars. I even changed my last meal on earth in my profile to Bacchanal Buffet- it was that good.

Weekends are WAY more expensive because of brunch. We had a little mishap when we called and asked for prices and were given the wrong information. When we told the cashier that- she said that we should have called the buffet and not the hotel. WTF- you work there, right?

Anyways- it was off-season in Vegas, so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch, mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We 

I seriously could list out all the food that I ate, but that would be a super, super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!

A couple of standouts:
- Beef brisket: It was smokey, tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.

- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.

Quail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. 

I am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination, you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit, screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet. It's seriously worth it.

It always kills me to write a negative review, when the idea and the execution was good, but a staff full of arrogant kids brought the whole thing down like a boat anchor. The worst part about when this happens, is that it usually starts with a good idea, lots of enthusiasm, a creative menu, and a ton of money.....and you have to wonder after it crashes and burns, if they ever do realize that it was the self-centered staff that actually did them in.
Such is the case here with the Meatball Spot.
We arrived at 6:30pm, and there were 4 people at the hostess stand. We approached, and they were chatting amongst themselves, so we waited. And waited. And waited. At around the 2 minute mark, it was laughable, so my wife says to me, "Should we set ourselves on fire?". This prompted someone to tear themselves away briefly (from what was only a personal conversation mind you, not a business crisis), and say, "Just the 2 of you?", followed by "There's a 20min wait, do you want to get on the waiting list?". We said yes. Then, they took our last name, then our first name, then (for some reason) our phone number. No greeting, no politeness, just the facts, and that was it, then back to their private conversation. We interrupted one more time, and asked if we could wait at the bar, to which thy replied, "Sure, if there's room". There was.
Now, here's a bit of an unfair generalization that my wife likes to make, and it used to make me angry, until it proved true so many times that I no longer had a leg to stand on. I'll preface this by saying that my wife is a stickler for the perfect dirty martini. So when she ordered a remedial drink, I asked why she didn't get a martini, to which she replied, "The staff is too beautiful to make a good martini". And the broader generalization she is making here, is her own observation that the more picturesque the staff is in a given service-industry venue, the worse the service is going to be. Now again, I used to get angry at this generalization, but I've come to accept it as being true, far more often than false. So I really take the place in. All of the hostesses, the wait staff, the bartenders, even the bussers were all right out of a fashion magazine. 
Then, everything just fell like dominoes. Busser grabbed my drink before I was finished, unattentive bartender needed to be flagged down before I could get another, 30 minutes later, we asked for a menu, and decided since our table wasn't ready (half of the table were empty mind you) that we'd get apps at the bar. When apps were done, we ordered dinner.
The server didn't write down the order, as is so trendy to do now. It was a simple 4-topping pizza, so I asked her to repeat it, and she repeated 3 out of 4. I repeated the 4, and she repeated a different 3 out of the four. I repeated it again, this time counting on my fingers, so at least she'd have the four-finger visual in her head. But no, the pizza came out with only 3 toppings anyhow.
In any case, the pizza was actually pretty good. But the service was such a joke, beginning to end, that it did not matter. 
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And in las Vegas, the customer service capital of the world, that had better be your strongest link. Here, it was their weakest, and that will be their undoing.
There are so many good choices in Las Vegas, I have no reason whatsoever to return to this establishment.

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL -- MONEY AND JEWELRY STOLEN FROM LOCKED ROOM!!!

Don't get me wrong because I've had many pleasant past experiences at this hotel, so much that I've even planned 4 different bachelorette parties over the years with 15+ girls each time staying at this hotel, but this trip was pretty much a nightmare and I never want to stay at this hotel again.

Our bachelorette party checked in this past Friday to 3 different suites, and after pre-partying we went out that night to the strip around 12am and didn't return to our rooms until around 4am.  I've had friends who have had things stolen out of their hotel rooms before so I was super paranoid about everyone being drunk and not making sure the door was locked when we left so I clearly remember pulling the door shut, hearing it lock and I pushed back on it to make sure it didn't open before heading to the elevator. I thought this action would cause any major situation from being avoided but I was wrong.  

The next day before heading back out to the strip for day club, I went to my large purse to refill cash from my large wallet into my much smaller clutch more suitable for a pool party (I section out my money in order to prevent myself from spending it all when drunk).  This is when I discovered that all the $20 bills out of my wallet had been removed, leaving only the $1s and $5s behind.  At first my girlfriends thought I had been drunk enough to go downstairs to gamble or to buy food but I reminded them that this hotel has no casino and no restaurants and that I was the first in bed that night.  To make me feel better, one of my girlfriends said she would check her wallet too and to her surprised all her $50s and $100s were missing.  The same problem with a 3rd girl in our room -- all her $100s were gone.  

I called the front desk who sent a security guard up to help us file a report.  We had let the guard know that we were gone between the hours of 12-4am and asked if they could check the security cameras for anyone going into our room.  After filling out a form to list what was missing, we were told by the security guard that the hotel "will always follows up with guests after a report is filed". The security guard then basically told us sorry but that she couldn't do anything for us other than file the report...

I was already upset, but what ended up pissing me off about the whole situation was when security called me on my cell while at I was at a day party to ask if we knew any other guests staying at the hotel -- I let them know we had 2 other rooms booked in our party and I even gave them their room #s, that's when security basically insinuated that it was probably one of our friends from one of the other rooms who had gone in our room and stolen from us!! I could NOT BELIEVE they were trying to tell me this, and I was INFURIATED.  Despite this, I very calmly let the security person know that the only people who had been in our room prior to our money and jewelry missing were the ones registered to the room, and we were the only ones who had key cards.  The security kept asking if I was sure, and I told them to check the cameras and they would see that I wasn't lying.

It wasn't until after we returned to pool party and we were getting ready for dinner that I also noticed that several bracelets, earrings and necklaces missing from inside of a jewelry bag had stored in my zipped up suitcase. This definitely added more salt to the wound.

Seeing that it is Vegas, I can get over having my money stolen as I probably would have spent it on alcohol or gambled it away anyway.  It's the jewelry I am more upset about since there were items that were personal to me.

In total, our room had about $1000 worth of CASH AND JEWELRY STOLEN FROM OUR LOCKED HOTEL ROOM !!!!

Overall, I am extremely horrified at the lack of sensitivity displayed by the Palms Place hotel staff and management. No apologies were offered for what happened in our room by any management, and no one even offered to switch us rooms so we would at least feel safer.  The hotel staff was very uncooperative, unprofessional, untrustworthy, uncaring and very insensitive. PLEASE DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!! It is very unsafe -- you may be robbed and if that were to happen, the management will not care about you or anything you will have lost.

FYI, IT'S 3 DAYS LATER AND I STILL HAVE HAD NO FOLLOW UP FROM THE MANAGEMENT AND NO HOTEL STAFF HAS RETURNED MY CALLS OR EMAIL ABOUT THE REPORT WE FILED.

This place falls to the bottom of my list of honest restaurants - they are scam artists. I can't justify giving them any more money when their flavor and culinary execution is mediocre and they scam people out of proper portions.

Here's what we ordered: 

Create your own: fettuccine + alfredo + chicken + garlic + sun dried tomatoes + crimini mushrooms + basil. The fettuccine noodles were cooked a minute or 2 past al dente, yet the alfredo sauce was actually creamy, rich and satisfying and I tasted some garlic, not too much. The sun dried tomato flavor was muted, they were not tangy or sweet - they tasted like they came straight out of a can and soaked in preservatives. The basil looked like someone sneezed one leaf onto the dish, just tiny specs here and there - it was truly nonexistent and not worth adding. Also, the pre-cooked/processed, bland, chicken was overcooked, dry, and rubbery - it really tasted like the cooked chicken that is packaged in the refrigerated section of the supermarket. However, I'll admit the overall pasta portion size was decent. I mean, if you must, and you have a pasta-carbo-loading-emergency, I would recommend trying the pasta here and judge for yourself - you might get your satisfaction. But! Be careful and don't have high expectations...you might end up in a better position than me. Flavor rating: 3/5

Create your own: gnocchi + pesto + garlic + cremini mushrooms. They are way too heavy handed with the oil here. It was swimming in at least 4-5 tablespoons of oil. The oil soaked gnocchi were soggy, mushy and didn't have any bite to them. Plus, the (oily) pesto lacked so much freshness and flavor - that's a pesto no-no. Pesto craving = unsatisfied. The portion on this one was the size of a petite women's fist, but I guess that's not a bad thing since it was terrible anyways. Flavor rating: 1/5

We also ordered the sweet corn and the mushroom soup with basil oil. The taste of both soups were far from memorable. The consistency of the mushroom soup was thick, gritty, and too unpleasing to the palate. It tasted like someone's haphazard kitchen experiment. The flavor of this soup was really weak and one-noted, I also didn't taste any earthiness or nutty flavor of mushrooms. Not to mention, the gorgeous basil oil drizzle was a gimmick- pretty color, but no taste. What's the point? It all falls to the bottom of my flavor radar. Flavor rating: 1/5

I found preference in the sweet corn soup, yet, it's still never something that I would need to order again. It had a slightly sweet, smooth texture, milky and not too creamy (no corn kernels detected.) For corn fanatics, I still wouldn't recommend this soup because of the horrendous serving size they try to get away with giving you. Flavor rating: 3/5

I'm irked and extremely disappointed in their soup to-go serving portions. They told us that they only offer 1 size, and for $4, the serving is much less than a standard sized coke can! It was literally 3 tablespoons worth of soup - It's seriously a prank on how little soup they gave us. I felt extremely offended and robbed. How do you pull off charging $4 for 3 sips of soup? I would never, ever, recommend the soups here - a total scam! (Refer to my 2 pictures of their soups side-by-side to a coke can to see their disturbing portion size) 

Oh, and about their Yelp check in offer: 1 order (2 pieces) of free, dry-as-cardboard-and-no-garlic-seasoning "garlic bread" was terrible. Lets just put it this way - If I tossed it at a window it would definitely shatter. Thanks but no thanks. Free things are great, but why even bother? It's a waste of food! (Even scavenger/bread loving pigeons would turn their beak away from these) Flavor rating: 0/5

Consider yourself duly warned.

I met the BF for a nightcap at The Mission on Thursday night, and it was such a cool place and had such an appealing menu that I decided to return tonight (Friday) to celebrate my birthday with a small group of friends.  Even though it was kind of last minute, the staff at The Mission was extremely accommodating, and we had an incredible experience.

(For those of you that follow my reviews, please note that our birthday dinner at The Mission was quite the opposite of our experience at Estate House in February, in a wonderful way!)

I am pleased to say that I did not taste anything I didn't like tonight at The Mission, and I did a fair share of tasting!  Starting with their red sangria, their special frozen mango margarita, fresh made guacamole, incredible salsa (I swear my friends wanted to bottle it up and take it home), scallop entree, sweet potato & potato fries, and milkshake dessert, I feel like I gained a good five lbs at dinner, but I would do it all over again for sure - we had so much fun!  The food really is exceptional and there are still a handful of menu items that I can't wait to try!

Sonia was our waitress and took great care of us along with Brian (who runs the joint), and a team of other staff.  Our glasses stayed full throughout the evening and they continued to check on us to make sure we didn't need anything else.  It was crowded with a fun vibe and I am sure we'll be back again real soon as The Mission is a new favorite in the hood for us!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

Jjanga is AYCE for $25.95
Jjanga is new and not busy
Jjanga has excellent service
Jjanga is a good pick if you're looking for some Yum Yum Rolls. 

I'm not a sushi snob, but I do prefer Sashimi's and Nigiri over rolls.  It's been forever since I've had a Yum Yum Roll.  For some reason, I was craving these California Rolls drenched in mayo. It's been awhile. It's been a very long time.  So, when the gf suggested sushi for our Valentine's Day dinner instead of our usual steak dinner, I couldn't help be get a little excited about it.  

From the time we walked in to the time we left, we had nothing but excellent service.  The team at Jjanga can sure teach a few other sushi restuarants out there about customer service.  They know what's up and they knew how to treat me and my special lady.  Good Job, Jjanga!

My Items:
Mells Roll:  This was my first roll of the evening. How could I not get this roll, right?  Inside was crab and shrimp.  This roll has a spectacular name, but was just okay when it came to taste.  
 
Jjanga Burrito:  This is a hand roll with shrimp, broccoli tempura, and crab wrapped in soy paper.  This was actually pretty good and great light option if you're looking for something that isn't going to weigh you down. 

Jackpot Special:  Jackpot!  I think I found the king of all Yum Yum Rolls.  This one had shrimp tempura on the inside with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and of course a ton of mayo sauce on the outside.  If you're going to eat bad, might as well get this. I probably could have gotten two of these rolls. 

Freshman Roll:  This had everything...tuna, salmon, and crab.  Wrapped in rice paper, my taste buds were a little confused on what it was tasting because there was so much going on.  But I still thought that this was good.  

Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  What was I thinking?  The brown rice wasn't the best and the chicken was a little bland even with Teriyaki sauce. My bad...I shouldn't be going to a sushi restuarant expecting great chicken. 

Regarding their food, I only had 4 full rolls, their Jjanga burrito, Teriyaki chicken, and Green Tea Mochi.  Needless to say, I was stuffed.  I thought that the sushi was fresh, the rolls were tight, and all were packed with taste.  Bottomline, the food is fresh.  On my next visit, I will probably go back to Sashimi's and Nigiri's because that's what I prefer.  But from someone that doesn't frequent a Yum Yum Roll, I recommend this place. I

PS:  They got the same rolls as Sumo. So if you're a fan of Sumo, then you'll be a fan of Jjanga.

Eff you McDonalds, eff you! 

You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. 

As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. 

After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. 

McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....

Honey Salt is the newest restaurant to open in Summerlin, tucked away in the corner suite that was once occupied by Nora's Wine Bar at the NW corner of Rampart and Charleston.  Offering a menu inspired by comfort food with farm to table ingredients, as well as a seasonal cocktail menu, I can easily see this restaurant becoming a locals favorite.

There are three menus that are available depending on the time of day you dine in.  Lunch is served from 11:30am - 3:00pm (http://honeysalt.com/menus/lunch-menu/), dinner is served from 5:00pm till closing (http://honeysalt.com/menus/dinner-menu/), and there is an "in-between" menu served between lunch and dinner that seems to be a scaled back offering of the lunch options.  I stopped in during lunch and dined at the bar, where I started with a Midnight Rambler: a specialty cocktail made with bourbon, bitters, honey and orange peel.  The honey added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the drink without overpowering the bourbon; my kind of drink!

For lunch I had their Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich: creamy slaw, durkees dressing, brioche roll, served with a chopped salad (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/honey-salt-las-vegas?select=lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ#lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ).  This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.  There are two pieces of chicken that are lightly breaded and very juicy, which gets complimented by pickled and mustard flavors from the other ingredients.  It's one of those dishes that is so good that I'll have to convince myself to order something else the next time I visit...

A big surprise was the salad that is served with this sandwich.  Don't let the "chopped salad" description fool you, it's a salad served with cubed cheddar, edamame, carrots, radishes, avocado and I think kale.  Very good salad that came together well texturally; I would order this on its own if I wanted a lighter meal.

Overall Honey Salt screams quality.  I'm pretty darn sure this review will get bumped to 5-stars after I try some more things on the menu.  Will they be successful?  Time will tell.  Or you could listen to me and eat there now, before word spreads and you're no longer able to walk in without having to wait for a table.

By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  

I got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!

So, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  

Anyway, this place has "Republic of Tea" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!

Next comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.

Anyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.

One of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!

If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!

I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble. 

I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of "Personal Favorite - thus far" on it. 

I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother "Gyros" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.

Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)

Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!

***Eleven's food is not exceptionally creative or original, but the food here is good, fresh and reasonably priced for an upscale lunch***

Eleven is part of the Big Burrito group, which has many notable restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This one is an upscale spot next to the John Heinz History Center.  The restaurant has a nice contemporary decor.  There is a slightly open kitchen.  The main dining room makes a good use of green and there is comfortable seating along with white tablecloth.  The room also has high ceilings.  In some ways, the room reminds me a little of a cross between Tavern and Lucques (though Eleven lacks the inside-and-outside like atmosphere of Tavern).

Eleven's lunch menu is very inviting.  There is a great collection of starters--some nice sounding salads but also scallops and crab cakes.  Their entree section features a mix of gourmet sandwiches and burgers as well as plates with proteins like lamb and fish.

The bread at Eleven was standard stuff--not much of a crust, not much of a chew and even a little bit dry.

My starter was good.  I had the seared scallops, which were garnished with fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, spinach, sorrel, and sauce gribiche.  It was a very generous portion for a lunch starter.  I thought it was good.  Everything tasted fine and a lot of the ingredients were good.

The scallops were nicely seasoned and had a good outside crust.  They were tender, but the scallops lacked the moistness of the scallops at Lola.  I liked the pearl onions and I thought the sauce gribiche was briny, sour and good.  I also liked the spinach.

The fingerling potatoes were too big.  They were not bland and definitely not raw, but the insides of the potatoes were not as tender as they should have been (4 stars for this dish).

For my entree, I had the Elysian Fields Farm lamb t-bones with a salad of radicchio, arugula, endive, fingerling potatoes, and idiazabal cheese.  Elysian Fields Farm is a great producer of lamb (the farm is located just an hour outside of Pittsburgh).  I once had their lamb at Sona and it was exceptional there (they also provide lamb to The French Laundry).

The lamb here was good.  The lamb was like little porterhouse steaks.  There was a New York strip part that was flavorful and juicy but also with a chew and less tender texture than the filet mignon-like portion, which was very tender.

There were two t-bones and they were a tad uneven.  One was seasoned a little too heavily while the other was not as juicy as I wanted.  Still, the lamb t-bones were flavorful and good.

The salad was a very bitter salad with the radicchio, arugula and fennel.  I did not mind the bitterness, but I think some would.  I liked the cheese and they did a better job with the fingerling potatoes here, which were sliced and tender (3 stars for this entree).

For dessert, I had the chocolate-peanut pretzel candy bar, which was surprisingly  good.  The base of the candy bar was a decent though not great brownie.  There was a very good and creamy peanut butter mousse as well as a thin layer of a dark chocolate bar.  There was a decent chocolate ice cream on top as well as peanut brittle and very good pretzel nuggets that were topped with smooth melted chocolate.

There was also a caramel sauce.  The dessert tasted pretty good and while there were a lot of sweet and rich elements, the dessert did not get too rich or too sweet (4 stars for this dessert).

The meal ended with a coconut macaroon, which was mediocre and dry.

Service was good.  My server was pleasant, personable, polite, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.

Prices were about what you would expect to pay for an upscale lunch.  When considering the many high quality and premium ingredients used, this lunch at Eleven was probably a little less expensive than equivalent places in LA.

I liked my lunch at Eleven.  While the food was not exceptional, my starter, entree and dessert were all at the very least good.  The food was not really creative or exciting enough to make me want to come back, but I think this is a good option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh (they had a pretty good lunch crowd on the day I went).

There are several metered spots along Smallman Street.  There is also a paid lot for the Heinz History Center, which is $5 per day.

There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.

I was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.

The heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the dcor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.

Three menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.

My bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.

The roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  

It took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.

I take the light rail daily to get from my place in downtown Phoenix to ASU.  As far as public transportation goes this is pretty good.  For the most part the trains come in predictable 10 minute intervals.  I've only experience an extended wait once.  I have waited 40 minutes in -5 degree weather for a T in Boston.  20 minutes is nothing to me.  Having disruptions in service along the way goes with the territory of public transportation.  Heck, it goes with any sort of transportation.  To complain that it is loud is just silly...it's a TRAIN!  I find it to be incredibly quiet when compared to the subway in NY or the T in Boston. Its not some rickety old high speed line or glorified trolley car.
 
Time wise and location wise its very convenient for me.  It takes me the same exact amount of time to get to campus as it would if I drove and it saves me $600 a year in a parking permit  I can take it to any number of local establishments, enjoy Happy Hour in Tempe without having to worry about a DD, and get myself to Chase Field in the summer when its too hot to walk.  (I live close enough where driving there is just plain dumb, but the 20 minute walk in 110 degrees is too much)  Which brings me to my next point, don't smoke crack.  Well not that, (but seriously, don't smoke crack) but I fully intend on using it in the summer.  I can endure standing outside for 10 minutes....if I can endure waiting for the T in a Boston winter, 10 minutes in a Phoenix summer is nothing. (And this will be my 3rd summer here so spare me the "you don't know the summer" lecture).
 
The 11pm end time does kind of suck, but it was 12 in Boston so its not terribly shocking for me.  It means you may have to take a cab home.  Of course livery regulation leaves much to be desired in this city but that is a different review entirely.
 
Now, I do think they could start to sell advertising inside, both for revenue and to give me something to look at.  I do wish the route maps were in better locations throughout the cars.  Placing them only in the middle means a large number of people (oh, like the entire rest of the car...) can't see them.  I also think the hand rails are awkwardly shaped.  The bike racks drive me nuts but I understand their purpose. 
 
But all in all I think it's a good start.  I'm happy to have it- I find it easy to use, clean, quiet and it gets me to where I want to go.  I would like some wifi for when I'm working on my laptop but hey, I'll take what I can get.

I love German food!!!! I have always loved German food!!!! 

Oddly enough, Vegas is a German food Mecca of sorts - at least for our part of the country. I was amazed at how many German places I saw around Vegas! Especially since the town is not the biggest. I actually got to try two places and one of them was the fabulous Hofbrahaus!

I know that German food is not one of the most well known cuisines in the world since it is so simple but if you get to try it you will see there is true beauty in its simplicity!

To start with Hofbrauhaus is beautiful inside and out. The building looks like traditional German architecture on the outside and inside. The ceilings are high and they are painted really nicely. They have a stage for live bands too! Seating is on large tables with benches just like you would expect in a Munich beer hall!

My BF and I came here on our last day in Vegas and I decided to treat him with the money I got from the machines!

What is really cool, and even impressive is that some of the food items are actually flown in from Germany!!!! We had a large freshly flown in pretzel to start with and we found out that the red cabbage, bratwurst and sauerkraut are also flown in!!!! We had the veal bratwurst, the chicken bratwurst and two beers. Mine was a incredibly good special seasonal beer! We also tried the apple strudel which was also flown in! Everything was seriously very tasty!

This review, of course, is not truly complete since I did not get to be here during Oktoberfest! The ambience here must be truly incredible when it is that time of year! However, if this place gets five stars without all the excitement of Oktoberfest - it truly must be good and, trust me it is

Service was pretty good! While you wait they give you interesting little newspapers with all kinds of information about the restaurant and its events. Next time we come I will make sure we get to check out one of the live bands! Expect to spend a great deal of what you win at the machines haha! This place is not cheap! I shelled out about $90 for two with tip included!

Parking is no problem as you would expect in most places in Vegas! There is a large lot adjacent to the restaurant.

I do not enjoy giving bad reviews, but based on principle, I have to give Merkato one star.

First, I should state that the dining experience itself was good. We enjoyed the food. Being Filipino, we grew up eating with our hands. The prices are cheap. We went with a combination sampler plate for $15, which gave us a great introduction to their cuisine. We also ordered their whole fish dish for $10. It actually came with two nice sized fish and a large plate of rice with tasty sauce.

If you want, you can stop reading here and head on over to try their food. You'll probably enjoy it.

Everything was going well until it came time to settle the bill. I had a TownHog certificate for $30. I had mentioned it before we ordered, but suddenly the server said she didn't know what to do with it. She tried calling the owners but was unable to reach them after several attempts. Strangely enough, when she had me call using my phone, they picked up right away.

To cut to the chase, the owner said he would not honor the coupon. He said he had called the company back in June and told them he no longer wanted to participate. So after sitting there for a long time, we ended up paying and leaving with a very bitter taste in our mouths.

I just got off the phone with TownHog. The representative said that because Merkato has already been paid, she would have to call them to confirm that they refused the coupon before I can get a refund. They've already been paid? That just makes the situation worse. It's just not right. You agreed to sell these coupons in order to get people into your restaurant. That's exactly the reason I was even there in the first place. It's essentially marketing and it worked. It got me into your shop.

It's really a shame because we did enjoy the food. But there's no way I can return based on that ordeal. Luckily, there are other Ethiopian joints around town with similarly good reviews.

That bread, though. Every time I think back to my exceptional meal at Streetcar Po-Boys, all I can think about is their amazing bread. Perfectly crusty and doughy, I would come back for that bread alone. Luckily, Streetcar has a lot more to offer than just mind-blowing bread. 

After hearing the recent rave reviews for this very new restaurant, I could not wait to give them a try. The decision to drive so far out of my way for lunch was made even easier with Yelp Deal they are currently offering.

The moment we walked in we were greeted warmly by every server in the place. I was already impressed. The restaurant is larger than expected and very cute. Lots of booths with plenty plenty New Orleans flavor gracing the walls and sound system. Service was extremely attentive and friendly.

My mom and I decided to each get a sandwich and share an order of corn fritters. I went with The Bourbon Street and my mom ordered the Da Saints. Our food took a little while coming out since there was a very large takeout order being prepared, but our waitress kept us in the loop so we happily chatted and took in the ambiance while waiting.

The food finally came out and I was floored. We had both ordered the regular size po-boys and we were sure glad we did. These sandwiches were enormous and smelled so good. We dug right in and all the flavors were just perfect. Perfectly crunchy bread that complemented the very juicy and messy nature of my sandwich. I'm usually not a fan of food that is that messy to eat with my hands, but it was so tasty I didn't mind. The corn fritters were delectable as well. My mom's favorite were the homemade chips, perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

Refills were plentiful and we each enjoyed our meals quite a bit. Try as we might, my mom and I both had an entire half of a sandwich to take home with us for later. I had been looking forward to trying some of their desserts, but we were just too stuffed. Next time my plan of action will be to share a sandwich, since portions are so generous.

I will be back, and soon!

2nd meet up for the International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) for 2014 and Haus Murphy was the place picked to try! 

It was a big group this time; we took 2 tables, holy cow!! Our server was a little frazzled about having to deal with this. We were pretty darn close to the bar and our server told me that he was not taking any drink orders until everyone had arrived and I had already known some were 10 to 15 mins out, so off to the bar I went!  

I'm still fairly new to the whole ordering beer, so when I walked up to the bar the bar tender asked what do I like, and I told him I'm still unsure, since I'm new to drinking beer, he said oh you must be 21 haha Love him!! He offered me samples of all the beers they have on tap, which I thought I was pretty sweet and I went with a nice glass of Warsteiner Dunkel, it went perfectly well with everything! Kudos to the bar tender!   When I had already ordered my drink my server came to me and told me well I'm taking drink orders now, and I told him you told me to go to the bar and get my own drink so I did and I have.  

Everyone placed their order, even folks who arrived 20 mins late got their order in, everyone except me got their food, even my daughter who was on the same check as me, ten minutes go by and the server noticed I didn't have my meal, oh it must have been forgotten. UGH!!!! I was upset!! But within minutes my food appeared and I took a bite and OMG ITS DELISH!!! and being upset slowly faded away, one could say I ate my feelings LOL (not really)   I ordered the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing, it did also come with a bowl of split pea soup, which was amazing, reminded me of the times I went to Pea Soup Andersen's in California, so good! The schnitzel with mushroom gravy was soo yummy!! Couldn't believe I ate it all!! It also came with fried taters and this Irish girl luvs them taters & wirsing, it was my 1st experience with that, didn't even know what I was eating when I started, it was creamy melty goodness, learned it was cream cabbage, omg really? That was dang good!

But what I came for was the Sauerkraut Cake, yea that's right, sauerkraut cake!!! I have heard nothing but praise for this cake, they said its better than a death by chocolate cake!! I had to find out for myself!! OOOOMMMMYYYYYGGGAAAWWWDDD!!!! It's amazing!!  

Sometimes the company makes the evening more pleasurable then the overall experience & the food was simply delicious , service well that could have been better.  I'm already craving some more schnitzel so I see myself coming back soon.

Many of you may wonder why I have not been writing as many reviews lately.  Well this is it....I've been saving up to go to craftsteak...not an easy feat on a yoga teacher's salary.

What is the result? I have two words for you: Monkey Bread.

Oh yeah, that's right.  You thought the two words were going to be steak related? Maybe "Skirt steak"? Or "short rib"? Or "Rib eye"?  Ok, that last one is really only one word, but I couldn't think of an amusing third.

NO. You're WRONG.  Where is it at here? Dessert and sides.

Don't get me wrong.....the steak is amazing.  And perfectly cooked.  I had the filet as part of surf and turf, and chose scallops as my surf item.  But really, we've all had an amazing steak and an amazing steak is what you would expect from a place with "steak" in the name.

The great dessert, however, was a complete shocker.   I believe I even offered to have babies for the pastry chef, which I hoped would get me an introduction, but instead only got me a "you're a creepy customer" giggle.  Oh well.

The ambiance here is pretty good EXCEPT the chairs are horrible.  Really REALLY horrible.  Luckily we were not seated at a center table and instead had at least one side of the table that was up against a bench because my poor baby bro who just had back surgery would have never made it through the night in that chair.  The music was also a little off for me....slightly loud country-ish stuff.  I like country; it just seemed a little out of place here.

Service was beyond great, and all of the servers very quickly realized that we were the "nice" kind of customers and were chatting with us and showing us adorable baby pictures.  We actually had two people waiting on us plus another two bus boys filling up water, and my water glass was never empty.  That alone is quite a feat because I drink water like it is going out of style.

In a place like this I always ask the opinion of the waitstaff and they were very happy to guide us toward some amazing choices.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes were so tasty; not too salty, very creamy and buttery and flavorful.  We also had the mixed mushrooms which, when stacked with a small piece of steak, piece of onion, and a dollop of potato made for one of the most perfect bites I have ever eaten.

The scallops were also amazing but the lobster was a real surprise.  The best lobster I've had has not been in steakhouses....it usually seems to be on the beach after being freshly caught and after I am freshly inebriated.  But this lobster was off-the-charts good. So of course the lobster bisque was great as well.

The breakdown:
Service: 5 stars
Chairs: 0 stars
Music: 2 stars
Yukon Mashed Potatoes: 5 stars
Mushrooms: 5 stars
Lobster Bisque: 4.5 stars
Roasted Red Pepper Salad: 4 stars
Lobster: 4.5 stars
Scallops: 4.5 stars
Filet: 4 stars
Monkey Bread: 10 billion stars. 

Complicated computer calculation outcome: 4.483 stars

I will likely never be able to afford to come here again after dropping more than 300 bucks for all of the above plus a half a bottle of wine...but that is ok.  I still have the memories.  And for at least another 12 hours, the leftovers in the fridge.

I was rather excited to visit this buffet after the big redesign several years ago.  Previously - the Caesars buffet was something that didn't really pique my interest.  Even though I've stayed on the property several times, I've always found myself dining elsewhere when it comes to the buffet.  This time around I decided to give it a try based on the all the buzz about the refit.

I'm glad to say the buffet lived up to expectations ... for the most part.  

This place now reminds me of Wicked Spoon and the buffet at Aria.  It's much more modern and features lots of small exotic dishes along with the usual copious servings of seafood, meat, Asian stuff etc. that you'd expect from a traditional Vegas buffet.  Even the little taco station was a nice touch.

As for the food itself, the quality was pretty decent.  The crab legs were great and it was nice to see them freshly steamed and served hot on your plate.  The meat section was intense, with lots of options to choose from.  Unfortunately I was only a fan of the prime rib as the other meats I tried (pork spare ribs, brisket, lamb etc.) were all on the dry side.  The sushi was also so-so, and relatively dry.  However, the other seafood offerings (cold and hot) were pretty excellent and the dessert section was definitely worth saving room for.

The ambiance was nice, though I wish the smaller tables weren't so close to each other.  However it didn't detract from my overall experience.

Personally I still think this buffet ranks among the top 3 in Vegas (alongside the Wynn and Wicked Spoon @ the Cosmopolitan).  However if I had to pick the best, I'd still go with the Wynn simply because even though their selection is inferior, the quality per dish is just a bit better.  Nonetheless, I think Caesars made huge strides here and I would still definitely come back on my next visit to LV.

The ramen scene continues to grow. Yes Monta Chaya, Monta's sister restaurant is the latest joint to open up. I've never tried their restaurant in Chinatown but I know it's very popular with both locals and tourists. So I was excited that they opened here in Henderson.   From the parking lot you won't be able to spot it but It's located between Japan Creek and Golds Gym in the strip mall on the corner of Eastern/Serene.  The sign for their storefront will be up soon according to one of the servers I spoke to. 

As with the other noodle houses, this place has sit table service. Your hostess will seat you at a table or counter. I chose their counter on this visit. Their furnishings reminded me of West Elm type stuff. The dark woods used makes the place look more stylish and gives it a more upscale feel. The seating arrangement didn't feel too crowded.  My server said they were so busy right before I came and that the lunch crowd had just left.

Server gave me 2 menus one with noodle  dishes and entrees and another that Monta Chaya serves exclusively. So you know I just had to try something off the Chaya Dishes menu.  I chose Chashu Bans (bahns). This one was glazed pork belly slice in a steamed bun. They come as 2 appetizer sized portions.

The Tonkatsu Ramen I ordered is just broth and noodles. I chose to customize with add ons they had. So there is an additional charge for them.  So keep in mind your order can add up. 

There was little wait from the time my order was taken to when I was served. When my order for the Tonkotsu Ramen came up, oh boy, I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl packed with noodles. My extras that I added were soft boiled egg and corn so my bowl was pretty full. 

The noodle soup was really good. The pork had just enough fat, the broth was savory. I personally thought it was just a tad salty and not as rich in flavor as the Tonkotsu broth over at the noodle house on Tropicana.  Still I enjoyed my bowl of ramen.  I asked if there is a smaller portion since this was way too much noodles for me.  My server said I can just request 1/2 noodles more broth next time. They still charge you the same price.
 
Service here was spot on. Everyone was friendly and polite.  Unlike the other Asian restaurant that recently opened up at the casino, the employees here are prepared and ready for the rush hour crowd. I'm lovin the ramen craze and welcome another one here on this side of town!

Well, hello Phoenix Yelpers. It's certainly been a while since my last review (maybe a confession is in order?). Well, even though I have lots of recent business experiences that I could have chosen to write about as part of my triumphant return, I think I will (re-)start by reviewing a local business run by hard-working people committed to quality results. What could be better than that?

My husband, Myles M, found Angel Eye on Kudzu.com, which is great but not as great as Yelp, of course! Now that I'm reviewing them on Yelp, it should be even easier for people to find them, which is a very good thing for the following reasons: 

1. They respond to inquiries really promptly. I emailed them for a quote and had a well-written, detailed response in my inbox just an hour or so later. 
2. They confirmed with me the day before and morning of my first scheduled service. Life gets hectic and there's nothing better than a reminder (or two) of an upcoming appointment. 
3. They arrived promptly without calling fifty times for directions. We've hired service providers who have called asking for step-by-step instructions for arriving at our home. That's what Google Maps is for. 
4. They asked for clarification. As any teacher, parent or boss would say, it's better to ask and do something right than to not ask and do it wrong. 
5. They got the job done and did it well. In just four hours (keep in mind we have a fairly large house that hasn't been cleaned in, say, 9 weeks), our house sparkled from top and bottom. I almost didn't want to cook a meal or walk around for fear of dirtying the place! 
6. They were upfront about their rates and didn't try to upcharge when the work was completed. We all appreciate honest and fair dealings, especially in this day and age. 

After seeing the results of their first cleaning, I hired Angel Eye to come back for bi-monthly cleanings. I look forward to having a great relationship with them (and a very clean house) for years to come!

Some of my friends laughed and others scoffed at the fact that I had booked accommodations at the Hooters Casino Hotel for my Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon weekend in Las Vegas.

It wasn't as bad as everybody told me it would be, and considering I booked many months in advance and found Expedia rates ranging from $45 to $55 a night for a room in the Tower building I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  For the race the "off the Strip" location was perfect as it was a comfortable fifteen minute walk to the start / finish area on race day.

My room was okay since I only spent time there to sleep and to yelp.  With the exception of parts of the carpet the room was fairly clean too.  I wore white socks in the room and each night my white socks turned either light gray or charcoal colored depending on how much walking I did in the room.

Here were some of the cool things about my room:

*The queen size bed was firm and comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=iHWbOO5Jzfh31dVthmiB6Q).
*Standard sized television (no flat screen) had crisp cable broadcasting.
*Comfortable desk had a brand new issue of the latest Hooters magazine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=96qyqd-PoYisLKTjPUswuA).
*There is a digital room safe just in case you decide to go out for a 13 or 26 mile run (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=BZMBwl3J5Y6vylsT0c-hBA).
*Clean bathroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=dPRiakqkf2jm4_1Tyw-Iww).
*Basic amenities (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=yqsvK9WYxf_OtSIjZUBXIA).
*Free bottled water (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=S4pY5Ebf2pSWPyP59WTvmQ).  Runners love water!!
*Two fake palms in the room look great without the flying insects (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=YBp_3-oEiKi-ayVqcVDe_w).
*Amusing privacy door signs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=toTBsd8WeZhsSMAEALOiOQ).

Of course there's always bad things that makes it a 3 star review:

*The comforter was lumpy.
*No free internet.  No problem as I brought a wireless card this time.
*The deadbolt kept slamming into the door jamb.  I had to whip out my Leatherman and do a repair job for them.  The deadbolt works perfectly now.  You're welcome!!
*Noisy pipes and the water pressure in the water closet was horrible.
*Toilet tissue holder was too short and the spool would come loose and fall on the floor every time the tissue was in use.
*Thin walls.  I heard every foul-mouthed conversation my neighbors had, but I heard every intimate one too!
*Horrible, lazy housekeeping staff!  I did a better job cleaning up after myself!
*Incompetent and slow check-in process.  The lady kept mispronouncing my last name.  How do you fuck up my last name?  It's three letters and the second and third letters are the same vowel.  Dummy!

I didn't take advantage of the slot playing amenity that came with the room.  The casino downstairs is very small.  Like I said, if I could find these rates again I would return.  If not, don't bother!

***Olives is a nice upscale lunch option in Vegas; Olives also offers a great view of Lake Bellagio***

The first time I tried Todd English's cuisine was at the LA Food and Wine Festival.  His station put out a very nice plate of Asian marinated steak (great marinade; tender and juicy steak), buttery beet risotto and a great cold corn and cream relish.

After this, I was eager to try one of his restaurants.  I did try Todd English PUB next to Aria, but it was not that great.  Todd English PUB is casual gastropub fare.  His Olives restaurant (a version of his flagship restaurant) is not really fine dining or formal, but it is much more upscale.

The food at Olives was significantly better.  There was a complimentary breadbasket, which consisted of addictive flatbread crisps, flavorful caramelized shallot topped focaccia and just okay ciabatta rolls (accompanied by olives and two kinds of olive tapenade).

I started with the spring pea mezzaluna, which was heavily garnished with spring peas, haricot verts, mushrooms, baby pea shoots, Parmesan, and a truffle burro fuso sauce.  I really liked the spring pea mezzaluna (kind of like pea ravioli).  The pasta was very thick and had a good flavor.  The pea filling was good--creamy and lightly sweet with a good pea flavor.

Though there was a lot of stuff on top of the pasta, I liked it.  I think less stuff on the plate would have made the really good pea ravioli stand out more, but the mushrooms were good and earthy.  I liked the freshness from the pea shots and haricot verts.  The truffle burro fuso sauce was not too heavy or rich, but it was definitely a thick sauce.

With all the components on the plate (and especially several traditionally salty ones like Parmesan), this pasta dish was still balanced in terms of seasoning.  That being said, this was a dish with a few salty notes that popped.  I think if the kitchen is not careful, this can become an overly salty dish.

For my entre, I had the sea scallops, which were served over a roasted tomato caper risotto and topped with a shaved fennel and frisee salad (the plate was also garnished with green pea puree).  The scallops were good.  They were big, fresh, plump, and moist.  They got a nice caramelized outside on the scallops and they were not too salty.  One of the scallops was not cleaned that well (a little bit of grit).

I liked the shaved fennel and frisee salad, which gave some lightness and freshness to the dish.  I also really liked the green pea puree--sweet, great pea flavor, creamy, and very smooth.  I am not a huge fan of risotto with entrees (especially since so many places overcook the rice).  The risotto here was fine; it had a good flavor and was creamy; still, the rice was overcooked and did not have the bite it should have.

A lot of the desserts on Olives' dessert menu seemed like standard stuff.  I am not sure if Olives would be the best place for a creative and ambitious dessert.  I had the banana tiramisu and it was a satisfying end to the meal though it was not that special or distinct.

The banana tiramisu consisted of banana mascarpone cream, banana cake and a Kahlua sabayon.  The tiramisu cake was garnished with a chocolate sauce.

The dessert was creamy and mostly moist (the cake could have been a little more moist).  There was also a great banana flavor.  Unfortunately, the coffee flavor was quite mild.  You do not get that espresso-soaked cake/ladyfingers flavor here that you get at other places.

Service was very good.  My server was pleasant and friendly.  He was also knowledgeable about the menu as well as polite and attentive.  There were a few gaps in the meal; the first course should have come out a tad quicker.

Prices were not too bad for lunch.  Olives is definitely serving an upscale lunch and considering that Olives is in Vegas, the entrees (priced in the mid-$20s) did not seem too expensive.

Olives also offers a nice outdoor dining atmosphere for lunch.  I did not think their indoor dining area was that inviting.  It had a contemporary and comfortable dcor, but the lighting was too dim for lunch.  The outdoor dining area is great.  The patio overlooks Lake Bellagio (and you get a special fountain show--the first of the day at noon).

With the view and the comfortable patio, Olives is a great spot for outdoor dining (and unlike the outdoor dining spots on The Strip, Olives' dining areas feels much more private and relaxing).

The only problem with the outdoor dining area is that they allow smoking.  Fortunately, there was only one couple smoking, which was slightly bothersome.  If more were smoking though, I think it would have been an issue.

A lot of upscale restaurants in Vegas are not open for lunch, which increases the value of a restaurant like Olives.  The food at Olives is good--maybe not as good as some of Vegas' fine dining spots but definitely a significant step above the cafes serving lunch in Vegas.

Free parking via Bellagio's structure.

Welcome to my worst dining experience ever with excellent service. Not even the waiter who worked his ass off could eliminate what a horrible dining experience I just got back from. Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review... 

Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKED

Pro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.

First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.

Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.

Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!

Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...

The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them. 

If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken.

V Bar may be my second favorite bar in all of Vegas!

Located on the casino floor of the beautiful Venetian Hotel, V Bar is a decent sized place that offers happy hour deals from 5-8pm, 7 days a week. 
The inside of V Bar is dimly lit, with a large L shaped bar, quite a few booths, soft benches and a dance floor. After 9pm V Bar becomes a nightclub that features a DJ, hookah and more. Once V Bar becomes a club you'll have to pay a cover charge before entering. Since I'm not much of a clubber we left before 9pm.  

My party of six showed up to V Bar at 5:30pm to partake in their HH deals. 

Their HH features half off beers, well cocktails and a small percentage off of their specialty cocktails. 

The reason I had such a great time at V Bar was that even though we showed up during their happy hour, and even though it was a Saturday evening during Spring break weekend, the place was a ghost town. We drank at V Bar for almost two hours and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. It was awesome. 

I had quite a few drinks in the almost two hours I was at V Bar. My favorite drink of the evening was their Creamy Coconut Mojito. It was strong but still smooth and sweet. I also really enjoyed their Key Lime Pie Martini, Blueberry Stoli Press and some crazy shots our adorable server brought us.

Since it was HH the prices were great. The service here was also amazing. Our server was super cute and very friendly. She really helped make our experience at V Bar an enjoyable one.   

I'll definitely be returning to V Bar the next time I'm in LV. It's a great place to start your evening before a crazy night on the strip

A small airline delivering low budget service at big boy prices but always with a smile, until something goes wrong.

A flying bus.  No frills.  No food service menu.  No wine list.  No toothbrushes or personal mouthwash in the lavatories.  Just horrible airline food and a very limited selection of drinks.  They even charge you for a blanket (but you can keep it).

What they lack in amenities, they usually make up for in service with some of the friendliest and warmest employees bar none.  It usually equates to a willingness to pay the 10-20 percent higher prices for domestic travel than UAL or Delta.  Usually.

Then something goes wrong (sorry this is so long)...

Departing LAS via Terminal 3 (Delta's gates).  Announcements from all other airlines can be clearly heard including those of Delta.  All good.  Hawaiian announces a delay of 30 minutes and promises an update at 5:30pm.

5:30pm:  Hawaiian agents tell people gathered around the podium that there is a mechanical issue.  Word trickles out.   NO PA ANNOUNCEMENT.

5:45pm:  Text message received from Hawaiian announcing further delay but promises update at 6:30pm.

6:30pm: ..........

7:15pm:  Flight attendants wandering around the terminal talking to groups who look like they are from Hawaii. People start to gather at the podium.  NO PA ANNOUNCEMENT.

7:30pm:  Everyone on their phone at the podium.  Better see what is happening.  Told the flight has been grounded.  Passengers must pickup luggage by a grouchy agent ("stop making me repeat myself, just follow everyone else and get your bags").  Take a shuttle to a hotel that will leave in 15 minutes (it takes that long to get to baggage claim).  Flight rescheduled to 7am next day.  Everyone must be back at the airport by 5am.  The supervisor says they are some seats available on the midnight flight so those with high mileage status should wait.

8:00pm:  Finally speak to an agent.  No seats on any flight for three days. I know because she just told the person in front of me but still she types stuff into the computer when I'm standing in front of her just to give me the same information.  Better still "the shuttle has left.  You need to go to XXX hotel, find a Hawaiian agent so they can get you checked in then get your meal vouchers"  Sorry, I don't play Where's Waldo.   Opt to get my own room at Mandalay Bay.

5:00am:  At the airport.  No Hawaiian agents at the counter.  No 7:00am flight listed on the departure board.

5:30am:  Still no agents.  Call 800 number.  Between the "your flight was rescheduled?"  and the "your last name begins with the letter U as in ..."  Hang up.

6:00am:  Agent arrives.  Flight has been rescheduled to 12:45pm. "If you went to the hotel with everyone else you would have known that".   When I ask why the didn't text us like they did the night before, I get told "We don't do that".  I show him my phone.  "You must have sent that to yourself".

6:15am: Agent logged in and ready to deliver excellent customer service.  I ask if the rescheduled flight is really leaving at 12:45.  "Doubtful, the mechanic is being flown in from Hawaii and has not even landed yet."  

Enough is enough.  Rebooked flight days later.  But there is a happy ending...

8:00am:  In taxi back to Mandalay Bay on phone with VIP host.  Within five minutes, second room booked, and upgraded to suites, immediate check in assured, and requested fresh juices and fruits to be in suite by the time we open the door.


Huge props to Hawaiian's providing generous $300 per person compensation for the problems when they are under NO obligation to do so (Department of Transportation:  http://www.usa.gov/topics/travel/air/resolve-problems/flight.shtml ).  

Shamefully poor customer service handling the problems.

I took the lady here for our 1yr anniversary after hearing good things about it. She actually wanted to go to the Melting Pot since that was where we had our first date at - but hey, I'm the man here right? And I say that we are trying something new!

Entering the door and going through the kitchen is different... and weird. If I hadn't read about it here on Yelp then I would have thought I walked in the wrong door. The girlfriend still swore I was lying and I pulled a fast one on her. Even after seeing people come and go through the kitchen, she was still skeptical! LOL. It is a nice touch though - my comment was "it makes it a bit harder to spit in your food with customers walking through all the time, huh?"

I know, the way I think is weird.

The garlic bread was good. I generally don't like a bunch of "crap" on my bread but I actually really enjoyed this bread. I could have made a whole meal out of it (I've heard that from others).

The taters were good as was the steak. The searing+flavoring was phenomenal on both her Filet Mignon and my New York. It was probably one of the better flavorings I've had on a steak to be honest.

I actually undervalued the bill too. I figured I'd be hit with a Delmonico's (Vegas) tab but it wasn't so bad. Service was good too - I drink a lot and my water glass was never empty. My alcoholic drink (Long Island) was also good as well as whatever fruity drink she had. Not too alcoholic, but still very tasty on both drinks.

Christmas really isn't my holiday...it's more for the Beautiful Carin, and I try my very best to play along and do what I should to make the holiday "joyful"...not my strong suit:)

This Christmas is no different than 30 or 40 others that preceded it...it's the end of the year and that always bring its own peculiar brand of "troubles".

Today, I had to visit with one of my attorney's (I know, pathetic)...some trouble with some partners in a business relationship and I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is...this attorney is my Doberman...he will chase people to the bowels of hell and bring them back screaming to be returned to Satan's loving grasp...if the compensation is right:)

I don't Yelp him, because frankly, he scares me...a little bit:)

I was bemoaning the holiday season to him during our session today (believe it or not our "chit chat" is quite brief at $425 per hour), and his legal advice was that I "sack up" and get over it:)

To reinforce that, he took me to lunch (I must look like I'm going to be a gold mine to him!) at Scott's Generations:)

That did indeed put a smile on my face and prepared me adequately for my next meeting this afternoon.

I love deli...I get to NYC 2-3 times a year, and consequently I don't think very much of the deli's here in town...overpriced, under-sized...less than we should expect:(

Even Goldman's, who's been good for several years, has fallen sharply over the past year.

Scott's could change my perception of the deli landscape in PHX.

I had a hot corned beef on rye that was as tasty as anything I've found in Phoenix...and it was huge...a restricted flight softball of hot, moist corned beef, between two thick slices of rye (from Karshes, next door, with plenty of caraway seeds:)

Four salt brine pickle spears, and cole slaw, accompanied this behemoth:)

I couldn't leave well enough alone and ordered a side of crinkle cut fries to "make the season bright":)

$11.00 US money for the whole deal (no extra charge for "extra lean":)

Everything was well made, tasty and nicely presented by the sweet ladies that serve the all the customers...I mean 20-25% tip service by these sweethearts:)

I waddled out, with my mood adjusted back to "non-grinchy" (I'm sure this lunch will appear on the bill from my attorney, at some point...I just choose not to think about it right now:)

I didn't even have room for a Black and White cookie from Karshes, after lunch...that's packing in the corned beef!

While Scott's Generations is not, strictly (or even un-strictly) speaking "kosher", it is definitely in  the traditional "New York Style":)

No, I would not claim it's as good as anything in Manhattan...but I gotta tell you, it's as good as a lot of neighborhood deli's in Manhattan...and easily the best of breed for PHX.

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

I wanted to like this gym. I really did. It's gorgeous, after all, and their salespeople do a great job of talking it up. 

First off, I have a very busy and ever-changing schedule. This probably made me a poor candidate for this gym to begin with, as their hours and classes are limited. Anyway, I visited the gym in April and was impressed with the sales rep, the facility, and the quality of trainers. I had very limited time that day (the story of my life!), so I filled out a little card (I did not complete any membership paperwork) and left to carry on with the day.

In May, I began the stressful and lengthy process of home buying and got even busier! David Barton Gym began charging my credit card, and I was fine with that.

Come June, I'm still absolutely slammed and haven't been able to get to the gym. At this point, I had been getting repeated phone calls from these clowns asking me to come in and fill out the paperwork. With everything I had going on, David Barton Gym wasn't a priority. I was fine with them charging me the membership fee. I had no issues. But what did they do? They threatened me. They started telling me that I would be charged MORE because I hadn't filled out the paperwork...

Long story short, I decided this wasn't the place for me due to bad customer service and asked them to simply stop charging my card since I had never officially become a member anyway . I didn't ask for any refunds whatsoever. What did they do this time? They refused to stop charging me unless I filled out the membership paperwork. 

Huh? OK...well, long story short again: Silly me capitulated and signed the membership paperwork along with the cancellation paperwork at the same time, again never asking for a refund. However, David Rivera (who is great, by the way - I feel sorry that he works for that company because he deserves better) insisted that I accept a refund for May. That was a nice gesture. I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.

Fast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.

When I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.

Making a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. 

I am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem.

My family and I ventured back to Biscuits Cafe for a late breakfast. The restaurant wasn't very busy, which let's be honest, it's only a matter of time before the secret is out.

"We don't serve fast food, we serve fresh food as fast as we can." is sprawled across the wall. Biscuits Cafe delivers and they deliver it well.

Since we arrived around the noon-ish mark, I decided to give the lunch fare a go this round. I ordered the Fiesta Chicken Salad and a cup of the Tomato Basil soup. My family and I were seated right by the kitchen, which is wide open, and you can see right into (and it's immaculately clean), I saw our waitress crushing up avocado and adding ranch to it. That is how FRESH the dressing was! My sister ordered the Breakfast Burrito and subbed sausage for chorizo (with no problem) with hash browns. My mother loved the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs so much last time, she ordered it again today.

Our food came out quickly and it was all delicious. So much better than I had remember on our first visit! My soup was perfect. It wasn't overly salty and was the perfect blend of tomato and basil. My salad was not just made of iceberg and romaine, it had spinach and field greens. The salad was huge, too. I have half of it left over to enjoy later. My sister's breakfast burrito was also on point. Loaded with eggs, sausage, onions, peppers, cheese, and served with a side of sour cream and fresh salsa (which was so good, I got a side of it too for my salad - for no additional cost). It was big, filling, and delightful. My mama finally let me try their country gravy. I'm from the South. I know about Biscuits and Gravy and Biscuits Cafe is right up there with the best of them. Creamy, savory, slightly peppered. It's the country gravy that dreams are made of and is probably an old family recipe. It's REALLY that good.

Biscuits Cafe is a large space, ample seating with booths and tables alike. It's clean, open, and warm. There's really no special ambiance or decor, but it has that diner feel and is just as friendly. Customer service here was phenomenal. Our drinks were never less than half full and our orders were precise. 

PROTIP: They have a rewards program. Get a free drink for just signing up! Earn points, earn rewards towards food. Receive $5 off for your birthday! For every $1 you spend, you collect one point. After 200 points, you receive $5 off. They have double point Tuesdays. Refer a friend, earn points!

***MIX provides a great view of The Strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of Las Vegas***

MIX is the second Alain Ducasse restaurant I've tried.  The other one was in Tokyo and it was decent but not special.  Occasionally, the food at MIX felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  The food tastes slightly better than nearby Aureole (and the service is better too), but MIX just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.

The Alain Ducasse name is definitely a draw for MIX, but the atmosphere is too.  MIX sits on the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay and you get a good view of The Strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  The dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  The lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.

MIX offers several menu options.  There is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several Prime steaks.  There is also a seasonal MIX tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of Alain Ducasse signature dishes.  I decided to opt for the Alain Ducasse tasting menu.

(Sweet corn soup amuse) The sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.

(Assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) The breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  The addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.

(Potato gnocchi, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) The gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and I prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  The asparagus was good.  The mushrooms were just okay, but I really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).

(Seared foie gras, date puree, lemon confit) I added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty foie gras.  The foie gras was not that good though.  It was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.

(Roasted Maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) The lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. The coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  It just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  And because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).

(Filet mignon rossini, foie gras, black truffle) This was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  The filet was decent.  It was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but I did not think the quality of the meat was great.  The foie gras was similar to the a la carte foie gras where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great foie gras (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).

The black truffle was not that great either.  It was probably Australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  This truffle part might be better in the winter.

(Mango puree) The first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  It was mango puree and a soda foam.  It was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.

(Baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) This was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  The sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  As individual parts, this dessert was decent, but I did not really love it as a whole.

(Madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  I liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  I wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  The chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.

Despite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  And because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.

I thought the service at MIX was very good, but the food was about the same quality as Mandalay Bay's other lackluster fine dining spot Aureole.  There is a lot mediocre fine dining in Las Vegas and, unfortunately, Alain Ducasse's MIX falls in that bunch.  If you are looking for better and more contemporary French dining, you should check out L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand instead.

The Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

Located inside of the diviest of dive bars, but that's not the issue to us - we enjoy a good dingy dive bar.

We came here for 2 reasons:
1. I had an emergency late night pizza craving. 
2. This was the only place open past 12am that had decent reviews (namely because Guy Fieri recommended them on Triple D.)

I'm just going to put this boldly out there - the pizza was a lie. 

I can't necessarily state that Guy is lie on this one, because I bet this place used to be good, then triple D aires, then the word gets out, then the hype man takes the stage, then they cut massive ingredients and quality to make a profit. Right. It's a sad tune we're all too familiar with. 

The pizza itself was very dry and I can honestly state it was pretty much all thick, dense dough. The dough wasn't even special or memorable - not even slightly sweet or anything that would make it stand out. The tomato sauce was barely noticeable and it wasn't robust, or striking in flavor. The cheese was also extremely limited as well. Everything fell seriously flat on our taste buds.

The toppings were all few and very far between. The meats were sparse and standard, nothing to holler home about. There were tiny specs here and there with spinach. Seriously!? How expensive is spinach, that you can't even hook an honest paying customer up with it? It was truly nonexistent.

Let me ask you this, why did we get the pizza with no love? I think my theory is concrete and valid. 

Here's what we regretted ordering:
Fatboy "not so wee" Pizza: $21
- subbed sausage for spinach 
- subbed salami for ricotta 
- this pizza advertised basil yet they some how forgot the basil? (forgot? or, on purpose... my paranoia is beginning to wonder...)

Pit BBQ Wings: $8 (single = 10pcs?)
- hahahahaha they either, a.) Skimped us, or, b.) Don't know how to count - either way, that's totally annoying and frustrating when you pay for 10 wings and expect 10 wings, but get 9. 
(To be fair- the bbq sauce was robust & the wings were well sauced)

Ranch: free 
- very runny and watery 

It's pathetic that I had a better pizza slice at Sbarro in the mall the other day - the red pizza sauce they had there was full of life and flavor, plus they probably put 1 handful of spinach on that 1 slice of pizza. Sadly, that's the opposite of Naked Pizza.

The only thing they got going for them is this: open until 3am. 

$31 bill for a disappointing pizza dinner is not cool, not cool at all. We wasted our time and our dime.

A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  

We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   

I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.

I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!

Just like my recent meal at Studio Cafe in the MGM Grand, Cafe Vettro really personifies a lot of Vegas dining.  There definitely seems to be nice restaurants in Vegas, but there are just as many restaurants that are below average.  What makes matters worse is that these restaurants can be really bad and still turn a profit.  These restaurants get so much traffic from the casinos that no matter how bad they are, they will always have customers.

This 24 hour cafe (located in Aria) is very big.  There is not much to the decor, but it is comfortable.

The menu features breakfast (served all day), sandwiches, salads and plates (including fish, beef and pasta).  The sandwiches are priced below $20; the plates go over $20.

The complimentary bread was some pretzel bread (with dried fruit).  I do not know if it was purposely served cold, but the bread definitely would have been better if served warm.

I went with the barramundi because it did look decent when I saw a waitress carrying it.  The barramundi (kind of like a sea bass) was pan seared and served over fingerling potatoes and garnished with edamame (kind of an odd pairing) and a thin cream sauce.

The fish was flaky and moist.  Mine was not as seared as the one I saw.  It was okay.  The veggies and sauce were bland and boring.  Some of the veggies were cold too.  My friends mentioned that some of their food was cold as well.

The waitress was trying hard, but the service at Cafe Vettro was not that great.  It took a while to put in the orders as well as to receive the food.  It was hard to flag down a server too because it did not seem like they had enough staff.

Cafe Vettro may have some other stuff on the menu that is better, but from what I had, I probably would not give it another shot (maybe I would try it for breakfast).  I think on my next trip to Vegas, I really need to plan out each meal (no matter how small) to avoid having another subpar (and overpriced) meal like the one we had at Cafe Vettro.

It's sleek, chic and modern with state-of-the-art amenities. 

We came to Vegas for our anniversary and booked our room for three nights back in November. They have several VIP and weekend packages, and we opted for the $100 buy-back option. You can spend $100 on any outlet to charge to your room and can get compensated for it. Pretty good deal, I might say. All in all, I was pretty impressed by Aria. 

The Lobby/Front Desk area was decorated in fall-themed motif and gives it a welcoming experience. It's pretty spacious and not too cluttered unlike in some other hotels. My only negative comment is the provided seatings weren't too comfortable. They could be museum-piece seatings, but not too friendly on the tush. There is a huge waterfall element designed outside the building that has a calming and relaxing effect. 

Security were stationed in every Elevator Landing so that is a plus in my book. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke, but walking thru their casino was pretty bearable even with plenty of smokers sucking on their cancer sticks was on every table. It wasn't fresh air by all means, but the ventilation unit did its job. 

They have several bars, restaurants, a buffet, clubs and a Jean Phillipe Chocolatier. You can also catch a Cirque Du Soleil show called Zarakana. Concierge and Front Desk were friendly and efficient. Didn't have to deal with Valet since they have a self-park option. (I don't like dealing with Valets since dings and dents always magically appear out of nowhere every time I deal with them) Luckily, I found a parking spot on the 2nd floor near the exit leading to the bridge. The parking stalls are pretty spacious and they have several floors that could easily fit thousands of cars. 

The room - What can I say?

First their key cards are the latest generation and integration of a microchips key access card that doesn't require you to insert the card into a slot. Just wave the card in front of the door handle unit and voila. 

As soon as you open the door, the mood lights and music turn on simultaneously and the curtain automatically opens to give you a wonderful view of the strip. It's pretty breathtaking and gets you in the mood for some bump-n-grind if you're thinking with your other head. 

Subliminal? Nah...these guys know what they're doing for sure. 

You can also control the lighting, TV, music, curtain, temperature and almost everything else inside the room with a touch of a button or with the remote control. Everything is fully integrated and we even have free Wi-Fi in the room. The shower head in the bathroom is effin enormous and spacious and the even the bathtub. The toilet is located on the side and you can do your business in private. I also love the texture of their towels. 

And lastly, we happen to bump into Hunter Pence during breakfast and took a picture with him. My smile must have been as wide as the Grand Canyon.

Decided to try this highly rated spa.
This review is from someone that is new to spas.

The area around this building seems a little ghetto so if you can, please park your car near the building and DO NOT leave any valuables in your car.  I saw glasses in the parking lot which indicates a break-in has occurred or someone got locked in their car.

The cost is $20 for one entry
You can bulk by 10 passes for $120 ($12 / entry)

Greeted by a very friendly lady and she explained the process which there wasn't much of.  Basically, take a shower, go to rooms, take a shower, leave.

They hand you a slipper, change, towel and a key to your locker.
Entrance for men and women are separate.
Once you go in, you need to take off your shoes and wear their slippers only.

Then you go to your locker where you store your clothes and belongings.

REQUEST - When multiple people come in at the same time, can you guys separate their locker locations?  The people around me were awkwardly saying "excuse me" and trying to get by eachother since all our lockers were near by.

The Shower
Yes, people are walking around naked and people get naked as soon as they go in.  Yes, ass naked with their wieners hanging out.  People are all taking shower in the same room and they are chatting in the tub.  It's very strange at first, but you just look away from others and start taking a shower.  They provide a tooth brush, shaving cream and a plastic shaver.  There is a mirror in front of every shower so you can see yourself taking a shower.  There's the usual shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.  Dry yourself off with the towel before you leave.

Outside the shower, there is everything from dryer, brush, body moisturizer, after shave, etc.

The Sauna
Upstairs (co-ed), there are many rooms.
Exercise Room - A few bike machines and a mirror to stare at yourself.  Would've been nice if they had weights.
Community Room - Many people sitting on massage chair to sleep or watch TV
Ice Room - It's just a giant freezer.  Why?
Iron/Magnesium Room - Just a hot room to lie down in.
Clay Room - Very hot room and you lie down in a coffin like place
Yoga Room - Seems like a room where you're supposed to meditate
?? Room - A room with a bunch of rocks or beads on the ground to lie down on.  
Work Room - Just a room with a bunch of tables and chairs so you can work or eat.
Wifi is provided.
Water is free.  There is a water dispenser
There is a random korean food menu too I guess in case you want to be there the whole day.

All in all, did I enjoy it?
It was a new experience
I sweated a lot.
I can't say I feel extremely relaxed or detoxed like I've read, but I'd probably do it again when I'm feeling like I want to take a break from Vegas.

Cue Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue", because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!

For most Chicago food lovers, Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes, there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply, the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.

This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night, it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me, there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.  

As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside, and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy, satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.

I was ordering for three, since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself, I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy, did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck, I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me. 

Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half, was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good, but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait, everything was delicious.

The other items on my family's order, were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each, another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09), along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95, including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said, I goofed and over ordered by a mile!

Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95, or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19, and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different, they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.

In Yelp-ese, a Four Star experience is "Yay! I'm a fan."  A Five Star is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Before tonight, I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon, they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.

Enjoy!

I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.

I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the "1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.

Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.

Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. 

I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.

***Fin (an upscale Chinese restaurant) at The Mirage is like a lot of other Las Vegas fine dining restaurants--overpriced, mediocre food***

Most Las Vegas (The Strip) restaurants are overpriced.  So if you are planning to eat at a nice restaurant in Vegas, you are probably not going to get your money's worth.  Still, the quality varies quite a bit.  Mesa Grill and Carnevino are both overpriced, but at least their food is good (at least on my visits).  There are other Vegas restaurants where you spend a lot and the food is bad (or mostly bad).  Fin is one of those restaurants.

Fin sits in The Mirage and has a contemporary decor that is nice though it does not really stand out.  The restaurant is very close to the casino, but it is still pretty quiet.

Fin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.

I started with the barbecued spare ribs.  They were sweet but not overly sweet.  The ribs could have used something else to give them a little more kick.  The meat did not have a fall-off-the-bone texture.  The meat was not exactly tough, but it could have been more tender.

I did not try the shrimp and scallop wraps, but they looked bland.  I tried the crispy shrimp toast that was served on a sweet and sour sauce.  That starter was decent.

For my entree, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass that was served over a sweet garlic sauce.  The sea bass came with a side of steamed white rice.  The sea bass was fried (the menu said wok fried, but it seemed to be more deep fried).  The sea bass was quite greasy.  It was also incredibly fishy, which was a little odd because sea bass typically does not have one of the stronger fish tastes.  It could have been because it was not that fresh or simply that the fish flavor became more pronounced in how they fried it.

I really did not like the fish.  The greasiness and the taste made me feel a little queasy and I can eat pretty much anything.

From the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.

We also had Shrimp Lo Mein noodles, which were okay.  The noodles were fine and seasoned properly.  The shrimp was plump; however, they were not cooked long enough.

For dessert, I opted for the assorted sorbet, which had 3 flavors.  There was lychee and blood orange.  I cannot remember the other flavor.  Only the blood orange had a good flavor.  The other two flavors were bland.

The sorbet here was all ice.  It was like eating a really frozen slushie.

The other dessert option was a vanilla creme brulee and it was much better.  The vanilla custard was smooth, creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  There was a nice caramelized shell.  The creme brulee was garnished with fresh berries.

They finished us off with a complimentary Baileys shot, which was good, and a fortune cookie.  The fortune cookie was pretty good.  It was a little thicker and more buttery than most fortune cookies I've had.  The messages seemed homemade especially since the paper appeared to be cut with scissors.

Service was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.

Still, once we put the order in, the food did come out at a good and organized pace.

Of the "nice" Las Vegas restaurants I have tried, Fin may be the worst one.  The General Tsao's Chicken and creme brulee were both good.  For the other dishes we had though, I think you would be able to get just as good food (if not better food) at one of the P.F. Chang's nearby (and at a much lower price).  There are many Vegas restaurants to avoid and Fin would definitely be among them.

The Mirage has complimentary parking (both valet and a parking structure).

SORRY JENNI, I REALLY WANNA SAY IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME. BUT IN THIS CASE, IT'S ALL YOU!

So here were the events leading up to this decision. 

It was a cold thursday night. I would say it was about 47 degrees with the wind blowing which made it even colder. So a hot bowl of pho would sure hit the spot. The wifey suggested our usual pho place. I wanted to be adventurous and try this new place based on the 4 star average. So off we went.

We come in and are greeted warmly. We sit down to a really nice glass table with what looks like seashells. I look around to see some nice chandeliers. I must say the decor is very nice. But just like any other relationship, once you get to know the person, you find out they are not who you thought they were.

So comes the unpleasantries. 

First off, I think they had the thermostat set to 70 degrees. BELOW ZERO. At first I thought it was just me. But after I looked around, I noticed everybody else in the restaurant had their jackets on. First strike.

I order their namesake, which is your standard combination. Came out at a decent time. Nothing out of the ordinary. If anything, it was a LITTLE MORE GREASY than I wanted. Second strike.

So we finish our our soups and ask for the check. We ordered two of the same soup at 7.99 a pop. So the total was 17 and some change. As I pull out my debit card, our server tells us that there is a 20 DOLLAR MINIMUM TO USE PLASTIC. Say what? You would think that they would at least have an ATM there but no. Even if they did have one you would still have to pay a convenience fee to withdraw cash along with whatever your financial institution might charge you on top of that. Third stirke.

So to make up the difference, we decided to get a milk tea with boba for 2.99 to push the total over 20. We get our drink. I take a sip. THE BOBA WAS HARD. For those that are not familiar with boba drinks, the boba is supposed to be soft and chewy. That was the fourth strike.

Now if this was baseball, they would of struck out plus an extra strike, unless they were bowling, in which case you would have 6 more frames. Originally I wanted to give them only 1 star, but the service and the decor were decent so I was gonna give them the benefit of the doubt meaning I am willing to give them another try at a future date. I will update this review accordingly based off of that.

So Jenni, we just need some time apart. This relationship looks like its not going anywhere except straight to this review. Maybe next time I see you things will be much better. Until then, I wish you luck.

***Bouchon's brunch is a good and not-too-expensive alternative to Vegas' breakfast buffets and their chicken and waffles is a good place to start***

This Bouchon location at The Venetian is open for breakfast Monday thru Friday, dinner nightly and brunch on the weekends.  I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.

Bouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.

For brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.

I went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).

They served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.

The bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.

I also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).

Service was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.

For brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).

This was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.

There is a free parking structure at The Venetian.  The free parking structure has elevators that conveniently take you to the Bouchon restaurant without having to walk through the casino.

"America Runs On Dunkin" 

There are two things wrong with Dunkin Donut's slogan. 

The first thing is that their slogan should not say "America Runs On Dunkin", it should say "Most Of America Runs On Dunkin" because here in California, there is no Dunkin Donuts shops. 

The second thing that is wrong with their slogan is that I don't believe anybody could run after consuming one of their cake donuts. Those things are so heavy that after you do consume one, you won't have the energy to get up and run. 

I had been told by many friends and relatives that Dunkin Donuts are the greatest tasting donuts on earth. Since we do not have any DD in California there was no way for me to verify their statements. Well last weekend my girlfriend took a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate her mom's 50th birthday. Since I knew there were DD in LV I asked her if she could pick up a dozen of them on her way back home. When she arrived at our place I was super excited to see that DD box in her hand as she walked through our front door. These are the donuts we tried 

Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Glaze, Glaze, Double Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Kreme Filled, Blueberry Cake, Apple Spice, And a bag of Glazed Chocolate Cake Munchkins 

Their cake donuts were delicious. I loved how they were somewhat crispy on the outside and super moist and doughy on the inside. The blueberry cake was by far my favorite. The dough is packed full of delicious pieces of blueberries and the top of the donut has a tasty glaze on it. The regular glaze and the chocolate glaze donuts were just OK, defiantly not the best glazed donuts I have ever had. The vanilla kreme and the apple spice were both really good, but again not the best I have ever had. Their little chocolate munchkins were awesome. These might have been the best bite sized donuts I have ever tried. 

After trying Dunkin Donuts I do believe that they are much better then the chain donut stores that we have available in CA (Yum Yum and Winchell's) and I also think they are much better then most of the mom and pop donut stores I have been too, but I do not think that they are better then So Cal's big three donut shops (that is just my nick name for these shops). So Cal's big three are "Donut Man" in Glendora, "Stan's" in Westwood, and "Randy's" in Inglewood. In my opinion these three places are fifty times better then DD and at least a hundred times better than Yum Yum and Winchell's. 

I'm glad I finally got to try DD. I can now say that these donuts are much better then the chain stores we have out here but I won't go as far as crowning them the king of all donut shops. In my opinion that title goes to "Donut Man" in Glendora. 

I do believe that DD needs to come out to CA. In fact if any Yelper out there wants to get together and make some money, maybe we can call up the DD headquarters and get them to let us franchise one out in CA. I think we would make lots of money. All these people from the east coast who rave about their donuts would give us all sorts of business. My only problem is that I might eat up all the cake donuts we had in stock, especially the blueberry ones.

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

Driving to the library I noticed a white banner advertising the opening of another new restaurant on W. Sahara Ave (same strip mall as Swish).  So I decided to give The Las Vegas Grille (former site of CJ Texas BBQ) a try on my way back.  

The restaurant looks spacious, tables are not crowded together, and the chalkboard menu looks beautiful, and there is a big smoker near the cashier.  It is a barbecue restaurant with a menu that can be categorized into the following major groups: barbecue meats, handmade sausages, meatballs, and sandwiches made from barbecue meats or meatballs, salads, side items, and desserts. 

The lady at the counter plus all the staff at the restaurant were all very nice.  As this was my first visit, it took me awhile to look at the entire menu, but they were patient and offered suggestions to help me decide on what to try.  I was thinking about the St. Louis BBQ Ribs, but ultimately went with the 4 Meats 3 Sides Combo, which consisted of Beef Sirloin, BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce, Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin, and Handmade Sausage (Artisan's Bratwurst)  for the meats, and Bavarian Potato Salad, Rainbow Slaw and Rotini Pasta Salad for the sides.  Before I was done with my meal, I also ordered all three of their meatballs (Arisan's Fusion Meatball made with beef and pork, Sweet & Sour Hawaiian made with pork, beef and ham, and finally the Southwest Green Chile Meatball made with chicken and turkey).

As long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed charcuterie items, from Taiwanese and Chinese sausages to artisan German and Italian sausages and hot links from the South.  After culinary school and having had the opportunity to attend a master's class on charcuterie taught by CMC Fritz Sonnenschmidt (master chef, author and leading authority on the subject), I learned to appreciate it even more.  And out of all the items I ordered, I would say that their Artisan Bratwurst was my favorite.  It is also very healthy, as far as cured meat products goes, as they do not use nitrites, nitrates or MSG in their curing process, instead they utilized a high heat smoke curing method.  The result is sausages that have a nice flavor, good smokiness, and not overly salty.

The Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin was also very good.  It has the nice smoke ring, indicative of true barbecue, and the pork was still juicy and packed with flavor.  Undoubtedly, it would be great in a sandwich as well.

The BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce has nice flavor, but was a little on the dried side.  The White Oak Roasted Beef Sirloin was okay, it definitely has the smoky flavor, but was otherwise too much on the well done and dried side for me to appreciate or enjoy it.

The meatballs were pretty good. Served as it, it is too salty for me (but my personal preference leans towards less salt), but serve it in a sandwich it will be just right.

I like restaurants that strive to serve healthier and more natural foods, and this place definitely does that!  Although they do not make their own breads, they do sourced them from a local artisan bakery (Great Buns Bakery), which makes a good pretzel bread.

Overall, it is a good barbecue restaurant that can be even better with more fine tuning.  And personally I would be here just for their sausage sandwiches, which currently is available in the following selections: Artisan's Bratwurst, Italian Fennel Sausage, Keilbasa Polska, Kids Beef Frankfurter, Mediterranean Sun-dried Tomato, and New Mexico Chile.

Food:  3/5  Some items are super good, while others were okay.

Price:  3/5  Reasonable.

Ambiance and decor:  3/5  Spacious arrangement, minimally decorated restaurant with a giant shinny barbecue smoker right inside the restaurant, staffed by friendly restaurant personnel. 

Location:  West side, just down the street from the car dealerships on W. Sahara Ave.

Parking:  4/5  Plentiful parking.

Cleanliness:  5/5  New, and kept in pristine condition by the restaurant staff.

A-OK!

So what would happen if Hawaiian food and Chipotle conceived a love child? You guessed it, Frank Stallone!, oh, I mean Braddah's Island Style!! There is nothing that I've had here that I didn't like. It's definitely worth checking out for the great casual food.

I've heard lots of good things about this place but never tried it for various reasons. But hey, guess what? My little homie, you know him, his name is Groupon was like "hey mike, I got this great deal for you.." I was like "oh yea? What you got for me on this bright and beautiful day?" And he was like "listen to this, you gotta check out this place, it's called Braddah's Island Style, and I'll give you $12 bucks of food for only $6. What do you say?" I was like, "ok, you twisted my arm, but be a little bit more gentle next time because that kinda hurt, I shall take you up on your offer." And so our journey began.

It's really similar to Chipotle. You can either order a burrito, 3 tacos, a bowl, and a salad (just make sure it's not a tossed one). Then you order your meats and toppings. Go for the steak, it's worth it. Hey! Not really a steak eater? Well then young sir, there are also other options available such as pork, chicken, and fish. Oh, so now you don't eat animals. No problem my friend, because Braddah's has that base covered too. You can get some tofu. There you go.

These guys don't skimp on the toppings. I was so moved by their generosity that the tears almost, sorta, kinda, maybe decided to think that they were going to fall, but it wasn't the case.

I see you coconut bark, giving me the eye with your deliciousness. Looking all sexy in the corner over there. Oh, I'm heading your way soon enough. Just give me some time to get things situated with my situations, then we'll talk.

So go here. Now! J/k whenever you're up for it.

We lost a good one; Ms Winnie H...  Vanished, kaput, finito, so long wherever you may be.  Such good things never last where all traces have disappeared and have gone without merit.  Secrets are kept and reasons retained under lock and key.  Whatever it may be, I dedicate this one to thee.

After seeing so many reviews of this worst kept Vegas secret, I finally ventured up two flights of escalators in the City of Sin, where whispers stay and never leave closed lips.  The Cosmopolitan hide-out comes to light as one ventures down a dingy hallway of framed magazine covers dimly lit by spotlight halogen lights (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#4bjZhYMwuBLPOZoW6DI9MA).  It's but a small 60'x60' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw).  

Behind the counter, workers pound and toss their gooey dough (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#lW79LoJSUg1RwIPrp_kAKw), making sliced triangles ranging from $4.50 on up based on 50 cents a topping.  For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my "Lost Wages" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.

We asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren't really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw).   

Various choices to choose:
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#qCog__OGMqN2fhJxaHZx7w)
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#q3VPFuV-SQjXhIab6f_9aQ)

We paid and waited just as patiently as others, noticing everyone kept within their small cliques, or busily eying their mobiles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#c9cbpz6hdIG_qINg5huokg).  The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!

No idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I've put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.

It was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you're with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.  I will loyally keep the secret of this unnamed hallway as faithfully as a yelper should.  The last buck stops here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA)!

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

First off, I should mention that I'm not the biggest fan of savory items baked in a crust, ie empanadas, pot pies, etc.  But I couldn't ignore my fellow Yelpers checking into this less than a month old establishment over on the Eastside and the raving reviews.

Thanks to all the Yelpers who reviewed this before me, it definitely helped knowing exactly where they are located.  And where's that?  Commercial Center - Lotus of Siam and Green Door fame.  They are located next door to Komol, so keep driving and you'll find it there.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  But we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar/counter seating with large and small tables around.  Because it was Superbowl Sunday, the place was empty so we had our pick of where to sit.  The waitress was so happy to see us come in since previous Sundays bring in a good lunch crowd.

We started off with the Oven Chips with added Garlic "Hand cut British style chips, cooked in the oven, with cracked pepper and sea salt." ($3.75)  It came out piping hot with ketchup on the side.  

The Husband was immediately intrigued by the soups and went for the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton (Cup $3.50). It came with homemade bread and butter.  We liked the blue cheese flavoring in the soup and the dense bread that accompanied it.

The Husband chose a Signature and Traditional Pasty - The Oggie "Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup." ($8.50)  He asked for a side of HP sauce too.  I got a little taste, but ultimately the Husband devoured all of it.  It's a pretty good size and for someone who drank most of the soup and finished the whole pasty, he was full!

I chose a Premium Pasty - the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) "Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes.  With a side of mint-yogurt dressing or tahini." ($9.00)  I'm always skeptical about getting chicken breast because of how dry it can be.  This was not the case at all!  It was super moist, tons of flavor, and just really good.  I ate half knowing that I would be hurting if I even tried to finish the other half.  (I did eat the other half the next day and it was just as good! The toaster oven couldn't heat it fast enough for me!)  What I really liked about their pasty is the ratio of filling to crust.  There's a lot of delicious filling and the crust isn't excessive or dried out.  Ultimately, just really good.

I took a quick peek at their dessert menu and was bummed out that I was too full to order anything.  In retrospect, perhaps I would have split one pasty so I could order a dessert pasty too.  Nonetheless, we came back about four hours later and picked up a Strawberry Pavlova "Homemade crisp meringue shells, filled with freshly whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi fruit and grapes.  Finished with raspberry coule." ($6.00) to go.  It wasn't the most exciting to look at when you take it to go, but it was nice.  Next time I'm going for the Apple Caramel Pasty, Shirley Temple's Pudding, or Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding since those seem a bit more unique.

They offer a pretty extensive beer menu that had the Husband wishing he could sit awhile and have a drink.  Happy Hour is all day on Sundays from 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 12 am on the other days, which means $1 off beer and wine.  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays also offer a special on the the certain alcoholic beverages.

Overall, we are liking the pasties that the Cornish Pasty Company are offering and are happy to see them in Vegas.  We only wish they weren't so far away on the other side of town from us!

Somedays I wonder why I even stay on Yelp. I'm so burnt out on the whole community, and I don't particularly fit in here with the breakdancing asian guys, single moms with inferiority complexes, and gossiping housewives. But, then I come to a place like DOWNTOWN VINTAGE BARBERSHOP on Water Street, and I'm glad Yelp is around to give respect and credit to a barber whose been a master of his craft since the 1960s. Ray is the greatest old school barber I have ever met. He is a man in his 70s, but none of the young guys can compare to him in regards to his ability to hold the straight-razor. 

Usually when I walk into a barbershop, the barber expresses to me that he doesn't like to shave people because it "takes too long". When I asked Ray for a shave he was more than happy, and even told me that he misses the 1960s when everyone who walked into his shop used to ask for one. It was the good old days according to him. 

The most important part of the hot-towel shave experience is the pre-shave preparations. Most rockabilly barber shops rush this process and use a barely warm towel.  Ray spends over 15 minutes during the pre-shave process.  First, he spends a good 5 minutes massaging the hot lather into your beard(Oldschool barbers from the 50s and 60s would do this for up to 10 minutes in order to soften the beard to a point where the hair just literally melts off during the shave).  No other barber in Las Vegas goes this far to satisfy their clients! Ray then puts the hot towel over the lather, to open the pores and further soften the hair. This step is important because it brings the root of the hair to the surface, so that a shadow won't be visible after the shave.  Because this is a REAL pre 1960s-era barbershop, the 2nd shave is not done with lather instead it's done with some type of lotion(another lost art that modern barbers neglect).  

The technique that Ray holds his blade is at the highest elite level.  Because of his pre shave preparations and the fact that his technique is so beautiful, he did not have to use pre-shave oils.   The younger barbers use pre-shave oils to compensate for their lack of technique. Like I mentioned earlier, Ray doesn't use oils because his technique is quite flawless.  I NEVER felt the blade against my skin, and if my eyes were closed I would have never known I was being shaved.

Ray actually administers a real 1960s style shave. The rockabilly places don't do this, they actually administer a modern 14-step shave.  Some of the most notable vintage procedures is that the barber roll slaps the aftershave onto your face, and then they massage your neck. The neck massage is a pre 1970s method used by barbers to loosen up a client who had been laying down for over 30 minutes. The roll-slap was a technique used by WW2 era barbers in America to wake up the skin, it's a long lost art. I particularly enjoyed it though.

After your shave he uses another hot towel to reopen your pores and that's when he applies the menthol rub. Due to your pores being wide open from the hot towel, the menthol gets deep into your skin, and even an hour later you will still be feeling that amazing cooling sensation. After all the hot lather, hot towels, aftershaves, and the razor gliding down your skin, at that moment your skin is going to feel very hot. It's then when he applies the final cold towel that extinguishes the hot sensation. For some reason, the way Ray did this felt amazing and was the perfect ending to an already perfect shave. 

They actually use running hot water to heat up their towels. Now that's REAL OLDSCHOOL! The newer places that claim to be "old school", use those generic hot towel warmers. The barbers here stick to 50s-60s protocol and they go way out of their way to do more than the minimum, they don't ever cut corners!! 

I would rather come here any day of the week over High Roller Barbershop for 3 reasons: no 2 hour wait, A real vintage barber on staff(not a hipster with an ironic mustache pretending to be rockabilly for the $$), and no meth addicts asking for money outside the door. Also, this place ain't just for men to get shaves...I've seen some of your profile pictures and a lot of you chicks have a lot of testosterone. You may also wanna get a shave here as well. Oh and I almost forgot to mention...Thank you Drew and Victoria for putting on this event.

I walked in with a sore back and legs, walked out with a huge headache and even more sore back and legs.!

I'm going to start this review by the main reason why I only gave them a two stars review. Worse experience ever! 
When our massage was completed, we charged the massage on our credit cards and I was preparing tip money in cash for our two masseuses.. Upon that time, one of the lady, perhaps the owner  saw that I had only pulled out a $5 bill, she screamed out loud in Chinese, "Only $5 for tip!!!" I looked at her and rolled my eyes and regret I didn't say anything! I was in so much pain, I just wanted to get out of there.

I wanted to give Coco who worked on my sister $10 tip, and for the guy who worked on me $5 because I was nice enough to tip on such a horrendous massage!  Instead, I gave $10 each but walked out of there mad as hell! I wished I was more braver to say something back and I don't know what got over me to even tip more! Maybe I just really felt bad for the guy. 

After days of walking and walking from casinos to casinos, my sister and I are exhausted! What was needed was a good massage! Found this place by it's high ratings and by Yelp's recommendations. Called in and book an appointment at 10pm with Coco and Rex. 

Upon our arrival, they took us into a little sectioned out room with two massage chairs. My sister took Coco, and instead of having Rex, they said he had another appointment and swore to me another guy was as good as Rex and they told me not to worry. 

That was the worst massage I'd ever had!! The entire hour was miserable. I wanted to get up in the middle of the massage because it was so bad, but I felt bad because he was a nice guy and I he was new. 
First, he was confused to either have me sit up first or lay on my face first. Coco that was next to us was directing him what to do. He wasn't well trained and didn't really knew where the body pressure points were. He hurt me by massaging too hard on my bone, His massage techniques was just pushing and pinching. He had long nails so every time he used his fingers to massage me, his fingernails pinched my skin. I was so uncomfortable. I didn't get his name, but he was short and chubby, in his early forties, and didn't speak much English.

P.s.~ My sister said Coco's massage was only just OK. Three stars OK.

So this experience had FAILED! ... will never be back again!

To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.

But then, today turned out to be a special day...
I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?

It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.

So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).

I've recently fell in love with French Cuisine and had the chance to endure great flavors from a cozy, cottage-like, French restaurant in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, Arizona.

I had made rezzies at Petite Maison via Open Table on Yelp. Parking is on the street or their nearby parking lot. As we walked up to the hostess' table, she was able to show us to our seats. Although the restaurant offers outdoor patio dining, we opted to dine inside to experience dining in this cute, kitschy restaurant.

*ESCARGOT ($11 for 6 pieces, **3.5 STARS**)
I was expecting to shell out the escargot from it's shell! But actually, the escargot was already pulled from it's casing and baked within an individual baking dish full of melted butter and seasonings. The dish was served piping hot (especially the plate itself) along with two slices of warm, toasted baguette. The escargot was delightful, rich and tender. The warm buttery sauce it was baked in, encapsulated every crevice and gave a lot of oomph to the escargot itself. Definitely a dish worth trying! I kinda wish though I had the fun of shelling out the escargot from it's shell, but at the same time I'm kinda glad I didn't have to get down and dirty for it! 

*FOIE GRAS ($18, **4 STARS**)
Was OMG! Mouth-watering, delicious and worth every penny! For those of you who are unfamiliar with foie, it's duck liver fat. The French would feed the ducks corn (in this case we knew the ducks were free-range and came from a decent place). The foie gras was seared and tasted like it was a piece of steak! As you cut into a piece of the seared foie, you got a piece of fat, which glistened within the light. Add a piece of the paired cranberry chutney, cider glaze and savory donut, this dish was mesmerizing! I do concur that it's worth ordering as this dish is what the restaurant is known for! GET 'EM!!!! 

*BOULLIABAISE ($33, **3 STARS**)
A saffron base sauce was made with fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and halibut. The seafood was cooked quite well and everything was tender. The seafood was fresh! The base of the sauce was simple and not too salty. Not the best nor the worst, but pretty decent in my humble opinion.

*POISSON ($28, **1 STAR**)
A seared piece of halibut was cooked well. I liked that there was a nice "sear" within the fish and it was light and flaky. The only downfall to this dish is that the lobster risotto was not executed correctly. First and foremost, the risotto was so soupy that it wasn't thick in consistency as risotto should be. In addition, after one bite of the risotto, it was quite grainy - as if the rice was not yet cooked!!!!! After flagging down our waitress, she apologized for the mistake and was embarrassed for such a thing happening. 

The dish was sent back to the kitchen to be corrected. After several minutes, the risotto was served. Not only did it taste slightly better, BUT it was still grainy because the risotto was not cooked well..... AND it was still soupy! Unfortunately, it was the risotto that had made the halibut a lackluster as it was not paired well together. I didn't want to embarrass the waitress again and send back the dish, but accepted it as what it was. 

Service (**5 STARS**) was phenomenal from our waitress. I liked the fact that she shared recommendations of what to devour since it was our first time visiting the restaurant. She even shared a few corny jokes, which made our evening fun despite the risotto fail. She apologized sincerely for the mistake and was happily to correct the error. 

Overall, Petite Maison is a decent French restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. But I've had better French food in Portland, that this place doesn't really compare! If I were to come back to Petite Maison, I would probably only order the FOIS GRAS again. I had heard their dessert is good as well. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled by Portlandia, BUT for what it's worth, Petite Maison is A-OK in my book!

If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL.

 I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. 

It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.

We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.

Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.

The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.

Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.

Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, "Happy Birthday". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.

If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.

Knowing full well that this festival could be a major bust, we came here with the lowest expectations. Even with the worst expectations, this festival stooped below that! There is nothing Italian about this festival. It's more like a cinco de mayo carnival or a shitty kabob cook-off. You're better off going to First Friday for quality food! 

People hate this fest - for good reason too. It. was. terrible. So terrible! I had to see it, to believe it. 

When we first moved here a few months ago, we were actually really looking forward to going to the "Italian Fest" (...yeah right) since my boyfriend is Italian. But after hearing and reading about all of the horror stories, scams, and terrible food, our enthusiasm died down immediately. Unfortunately, we didn't get to dodge the bullet this time since our friends wanted to meet there for dinner and I didn't have the heart to crush on their plans. 

The verdict? Let me tell you this, it's not worth it at all. At all! Everyone in our party had this look of complete disgust on their face by the end of the night. Talk about buyers remorse! Not only was this "fake Italian food Fest" a scam, so were the not-so-Italian vendors acting overly stereotypical "Italian" 

Vendor: Ayyyyye guys whaddya gonna do?! Comma try authentic sausage and peppahs justa likea momma usedtah to makea! 

Me: no thanks 

Vendor: ahhhhhhhhhhhh! You see dis!? You see dis? (Throwing his arms theatrically in the air in disappointment that we're not buying his food) 

Me: Keep walking. Hurry. 


Here's how you quickly burn money:
- $18 for 2 adults to enter this hell-hole called San Gennaro Feast

- $8 for doughy-as-hell, stale, and nasty funnel cake from Funnel Cake Factory

- $15 (!!!!?) for a super ripoff ((1 inch)) lobster (cut with all crab) roll from the Lobsta Trap. Are you f'n kidding me?! Who the hell do you think you are playin' with give'n us that ant sized portion!?

- $12 (?!!) for ((3)) !!! offensively-salt-bombed jumbo cajun shrimp from T&T's Shrimp Basket

- $10 for a plate of stupid, overcooked, burnt, rock-hard steak and dry-as-death chicken kabobs with wilted salad and dripping in oil, soggy fries from Kabob House 

^^^ you have been duly warned. 

Only 3 items were actually decent and worth recommending:
- $5 for 2: 1 chicken and 1 pulled pork tacos topped with coleslaw and a side of baked bean chili from Billy's Bar-B-Que. I highly recommend the pull pork tacos topped with coleslaw! Juicy and delicious!!! 5/5

- $4 dried and overcooked BBQ corn from the Roasted Corn on the Cob stand. The corn was overcooked but it was pleasantly sweet. Just make sure to add all of those toppings and you're in business! 3/5

- $5 for a cold, bread-y, mushroom & olive calzone from JR's fine Italian Cuisine. The gal apologized to us that it was cold and took it back to reheat it. That didn't do much to make it better, but my Italian boyfriend ended up finding a glimmer of satisfaction in it. 3/5

Oh yeah, and to the lady that uses terrible sales tactics at the front entrance, harassing us to buy a groping session with your dancing monkey...ain't nobody got time for dat!

What an amazing experience from start to finish! Locals are in for a treat and I have no doubt that word is about to get out. I'm considering myself lucky to be amongst the first set of patrons. 

I have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word, starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)

Unreal! These prices are too good to be true... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running, not walking, to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.  

Took some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park! 

Some things that I recommend trying are:

Ty Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)

SOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)

Beef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite, pictured.)

Rock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeo aioli and the sweet banana sesame)

Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)

Soft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite, pictured)

Crme Brle (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double, she knows all about it! *wink*)

If there's something you usually order that is not on the menu, ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not. 

I would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself, Mr. John Lee, came out to welcome us. He made us feel like true VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best. 

I have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire, mark my words! 

I'm eating there again tonight. Yep, it is THAT good!

Update: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently, one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease. Chef John Lee hooked up many options for her. My guests were so impressed! Thanks Soho Japanese Restaurant and John Lee for all the extra special things that you do.

"Quick and curious and playful and strong." It was just like that Kate Spade tag line, how I went though this store. I "quickly" looked at all the sale signs, "curiously" looked at each and every section, "playfully" moved my way through the store and "strongly" resisted the urge to buy everything hehe!

I've always been a fan of Kate Spade. In fact, I love this brand as much as I love Hello Kitty. Gasp! This may come as a surprise for some who know my HK fanatic-ism but it is true. Kate Spade is fun, colorful, chic and stylish. My "Eat Cake for Breakfast" purse is one of my favorites and one that fits me very well. With all that being said, I was one happy girl visiting this store. It was actually my first and my must stop when I went to the Premium Outlets in Vegas.

True to the Kate Spade name, this store was colorful, lively and cute. They had several latest style purses as well as clothes, tech accessories and jewelry. They had mostly 30% to 40% off deals. I managed to get one of the last two of a cute Stevie bag from this season (the other was bought by a guy who saw the bag I got and he decided he wanted to get one for his girlfriend- lucky girl! Same guy followed me to the Michael Kors store right across from Kate Spade- ahh seriously lucky girlfriend. Haha- my Michael Kors review is next.).

I was super happy with my purse purchase but I did want to shop even more and found that the jewelry section had great deals as well. The people who worked here were friendly and helpful. They held the items I wanted up front as I continued to look for more cute stuff. They also were nice in making suggestions and chatting with me about the various styles. 

At the end of my visit to Kate Spade, I left as one happy camper with very cute Kate Spade goodies.

I am sorry...

/Commences Rant

I will never return here. I was sorely disappointed and feel like I was treated as a subpar customer. Yeah not everyone eats sushi. I am that guy. Consequently I did join a large group of friends here. I knew that things wouldn't exactly be outstanding, but this place took it to a whole new level. The only reason they get a two star vs a one star is that most of my friends received excellent service and food. 

Whereas I got worse treatment than the red headed step child... Hell that is demeaning I don't even have red hair  *SMH*. In fact my trip here was one of my worst restaurant experiences in the last 10-15 years. *extremely disappointed*

So while all my friends purchased the AYCE meal and started to receive their various foods within 5 minutes of ordering, my appetizers (sesame chicken and shrimp tempura) took about 45 minutes to receive the first item, the shrimp tempura. It took another 10 plus minutes to receive the sesame chicken.

REALLY YAMA SUSHI!!! You brought out appetizers to my friends on the AYCE menu within 20 minutes. Why cant you bring the non AYCE appetizers to the guy who has nothing else to eat?  But your attitude seemed to be who cares he isn't getting AYCE.

Knowing that they are concentrating on the AYCE folks and the rolls that most of the people are getting, I knew I would have my food delayed. What ended up happening? Everyone was on their third or fourth roll at least before my food was served. 

Consequently I think you guys can go jump off a cliff. Way to treat a customer who wanted to partake in what he had heard was an awesome restaurant experience. I can count the number of times on a single hand where I have had a worse dining experience in my entire life!

Way to ruin what was otherwise a wonderful day for me with a large number of friends. I SERIOUSLY HOPE YOU DECIDE TO REVAMP YOUR POLICY TOWARDS NON AYCE PAYING CUSTOMERS OR THOSE WHO WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, AND YET STILL ORDER DIRECTLY OFF OF YOUR MENU WITHOUT A SINGLE CHANGE REQUEST!

WHY THE HELL EVEN HAVE THOSE CHOICES LISTED WITH PRICING THAT IS NOT AYCE IF YOU JUST WANT TO IGNORE THE GUY WHO ORDERS DINNER THAT WAY.

I HOPE BEYOND A SHADOW OF A BELIEF THAT CUSTOMERS TURN AWAY FROM YOUR RESTAURANT IF THEY ARE LIKE ME. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND NOT MADE TO WAIT AN OVERLY EXTENSIVE PERIOD OF TIME TO GET WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY SERVING TO THOSE ALL AROUND HIM.

I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AND I HOPE THAT OTHERS WILL NOT AS WELL.

To add insult to injury your staff came after me for leaving less than the pre-ordained tip as listed on the check since I was part of a party of 6 or more. You should have been happy I left a tip at all. But to have you come after me demanding more for absolutely no service and unreasonable treatment, well F YOU. I am still pissed off about it and it has been several weeks.  

I hope your business goes bust!

/Ends Rant

I am Schel and I approve this review!

Edit: Screw it I cant stand to give them 2 stars... I have to drop it to a 1 star... still super ticked off...

This Southern girl was good and satistifed when she left Hot and Juicy Crawfish!  

When I saw this restaurant flash on the Yelp front page,  I thought I would give it a try eventually.  As I looked over their website, I realized, this is the same resto/company that I have had on my Vegas bookmarks for years.  The second I realized that, I bumped up my visit to "today".  

Going on a weekday at 4:30p has its bonuses - parking on Mill is much easier and Mill is not as crowded. So, I park and walk toward the restaurant.  The one thing I want to warn the Yelp community about is that the address says 740 S Mill Ave, the restaurant is actually facing 7th street and is west of Mill Ave (west/around the corner from Mellow Mushroom).  

So I went alone as this was decided an hour before I arrived.  I am so disappointed that you can't order a combo boil.  So I made up one.  I ordered 1lb of crawfish with the Hot and Juicy sauce served Spicy Hot.  I also ordered a half pound of shrimp (the only thing that can be ordered by the half lb) with the Lousiana Style sauce served Spicy Hot with sausage and a corn.  Each order comes in a plastic bag with enough seasoning to cover, but not drawn your crustaceans.   I couldn't eat it all, so I saved the shrimp order and ate the crawdaddies.  In general, if you like southern food that is spicy and full of flavors, my advice is to completely bypass the any other sauce option and go straight to the Hot and Juicy - trust me on this. (Order a different flavor as a side, thank me later)

So, I pull my first crawfish tail off and put that head to my mouth and sucked the head and out flowed the the hottest and juiciest crawfish deliciousness I had ever had in my life.  Sucking dem heads and pulling dem tails is how you eat crawfish.  But what I LOVED about these crawfish the most is how juicy they were!  So much seasoning and juice flows into your mouth out of those heads!  And the tails were tender and not overcooked.  So many places muck up crawfish by overcooking them!  They were also so tender and just right because they had not been frozen.  Yes, fresh, ALIVE when they cook them fresh!  Someone help me, I could have slapped someone it was so good!  I have eaten crawfish my entire life and I am pretty sure these were definitely seasoned the best because the Hot and Juicy sauce is so much thicker than the typical crawfish boil juice.  So the flavor just coats your mouth really good.

Thats it folks.  Get yo' self on over there and enjoy it.  Get over there, roll up your sleeves,  put on a bib (very important!) and get a beer! For Pete's sake, don't look like an amateur and wear the gloves they offer!  And always  remember to Suck dem Heads and Pull dem tails.

After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.

The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. 

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.

Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. 

Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. 

Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. 

They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar.

North Las Vegas residents might say, "It's the biggest one I ever saw...in grocery stores, that is."  The parking lot is as big as its neighbor's -   Target.  It's right off the 215 freeway and Decatur in North Vegas, just north of this new growing sin city suburb. I went on St. Patrick's Day, two weeks after the first day of Grand Opening, and customers were plenty. and plenty happy.  The woman in line ahead of us said that she's probably going to abandon Wal Mart and start coming here. Wal Mart, a few miles from here, so far has been very crowded but maybe that will change..

If you like size, variety, and a place to get a walk in while shopping, this box-like store without a membership is for you.  There will be almost 200 employees with new jobs, so that's good.  It's also 92,000 square feet, open 24 hours, is bright inside, and has things you don't find in discount stores, like grind your own peanut butter- though I didn't see that.  There were also bulk pet foods, lots of bulk candies and snacks, and brewed coffee samples next to the 20 or so bulk coffee varieties. On the down side, it's so big you things might be hard to find. I wasn't the only lost shopper, as others paced up and down looking for signs describing the aisle's items. Several minutes later, I found an employee with a list of items and their locations. And, you have to bag your own groceries, so in that sense, it's like a Food 4 less. Beware those shopping carts are giant,
big enough to put your St. Bernard in (dogs aren't allowed in the store, though!)

So you grab a huge cart, and notice the front door specials are nuts....well, it depends on the week but besides cheap peanuts this week, there were Cheerios for under $2.00, bacon for $2.99 a pound with no limit, and other low priced things like 3 twelve pack of Pepsi products for $10, etc.  It changes weekly.

Then you step into the produce department, and find a decently stocked, colorful department including 5 varieties of apples for less than $2 a lb. Honeydew Melons are not much cheaper at 99 cents a pound than other places, though they even had some hard to find things like plums and nectarines from Chile for $2.50 a lb.  Not everything is cheap, but a lot of it is.  We didn't buy any meat today, but there were pretty good prices, definitely cheaper overall that Albertson's but more close to Wal Mart Neighborhood Market. There is also a Smith's a few miles from here, so the shopping choices are good for this hood. 

Overall, I'm a fan though stores like this hopefully don't get ghetto like most Wal Marts eventually do. When I visit relatives here again this summer when the temperatures are over 100 degrees, I'll be inside getting my exercise while shopping in the cool new store.

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

I haven't been to Buca di Beppo in years, and I recently had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant with my friends here in Vegas.  From the moment you walk into the restaurant, there is tons of excitement and energy!  Love it! 

First, you have to set expectations before eating here and writing a review - it is a family style restaurant that caters to large groups.   This is not a James Beard Award Winning restaurant, but it is a fun place for groups to grab a meal together.

I called in to make a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. and Miss Hostess was the nicest person I've encountered in a long time!  Easy Peasy!  When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by three lovely hostesses.  We were told to wait 5 minutes for them to set up our table (HUH?  The restaurant was half empty!).  After being seated, we were quickly greeted and served by lovely Miss Server Shennae!

For starters, we got the Apple Gorgonzola Salad (Small for 4).  The salad was your typical green salad but was loaded with gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced Granny Apples, walnuts and cranberries.  It was light, fresh, and tasty!   Grade:  B

For the main dish, we got the Frutti di Mare Pasta (Small for 4).  The pasta was topped with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari.   The pasa noodles were tossed with a rich and spicy marinara sauce.  I loved the taste of this dish.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles.  It tasted like either the noodles were over cooked or were a cheap brand of noodles.  The texture was mushy and did not have a chew to it like most noodles should have.    Grade:  B-

The kiddos at the table ordered from the kid's menu ($5!).  Each had a personalized sized cheese pizza or spaghetti and meatballs.  Both selections were VERY generous and large!  The pizzas were 9" across.  The spaghetti and meatballs was served in a medium sized pasta bowl and looked like it was enough for 2 adults.   (It looked so tasty, I wanted to eat the leftovers of the kids, but I refrained!).   Grade:  A!

Best part of the meal was the energy and smiles of Miss Server Shennae!  She was patient and really made it an enjoyable evening!  You can tell she loves her job!  Thanks a bunch, Shennae!

Food Grade:  B
Service Grade:  A!
Worth the Money Grade:  B-  (sorry, the bad pasta noodles and prices did this)
Overall Impression Grade:  B

OMG!  Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had.  If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino.

My friends are thoughtful.  On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race.  My race morning ritual is pretty simple.  One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead.  Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping.

Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning.  They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade.  The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away.  With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides.

Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA).  I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight.  The sandwich was incredible.  The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City.  It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's.  The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it.  The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill.  It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning.

Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning.  Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make.

I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another.  This time I had the New York Skyhigh (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice.  I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top.  Here it was without the froth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q) as I had already sucked it up.  I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink?  Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz!

Greenberg's is very reasonably priced too as their sandwiches are mostly under $10 including the sides!

Yaaay! I'm always excited when I get to write a one-star review! Trust me, it is NOT often that I write a one-star, you have to be truly horrendous to get a one-star from me. Well, truly horrendous is the perfect description for Emperor's Garden. 

Firstly, I didn't pick the place, my traveling book club met there. Being Asian, I tried to be open-minded about it, as none of my Asian Yelpie friends seem to dig this place. I  was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to see it wasn't Americanized at all, actually it's smack in the middle of Chinatown, and the place is just as run-down and stinky as the rest of it (this is not an insult)!

The place was packed with Chinese people, a tour company had taken over the place for dinner. Why would Chinese people from China would want to eat here? I have no idea. Maybe the horrendous service reminded them of home? 

The food was mediocre to bad. The highlight of the night was the eggplant, it was decent. I got the combination fried rice, which was bland and simple, cooked more in the true Taiwanese style than the American style. I tried the Seafood Lo Mein, which was decent, again bland, as authentic lo mein is, but not enough seafood. Nothing about the food wowed me, 3-stars at best. 

The one-star is because of the horrible service. The place has a full bar and someone in my party mentioned that house wine was $2 a glass. What a deal! She had even mentioned it to the waiter, specifically asking if the glass was $2, and he mumbled something like, "yes, we have it, but it's $3." The other lady at my table said, "I would like the $5 glass of wine, NOT the house wine." Soooo...  the wine comes, and just for fun, everyone tried the $2 wine (I swear it was the two-buck chuck they sell at Trader Joe's) then we tried the $5 wine. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME! But we laughed it off. We were having fun and the lady didn't seem to mind paying the extra $2.

The bad service came when we got the bill. They charged everyone $5 for a glass of wine. When we complained, the OWNER said that's the price and we have to pay. WTF??? We even pulled up the website to show that the house wine was $2 and we specifically asked when we ordered. The OWNER said that it wasn't her website and she would not honor the price. LOL. Well, the address was the same? The name of the restaurant was the same? I guess someone with a huge vendetta against this place took it upon themselves to make a fake website and sell glasses of wine for $2. HAHAHA. What a bunch of bullcr@p. And the OWNER was getting nasty about it, she was so upset we weren't going to pay the extra $2! Her restaurant was packed, we just rang up a $200 bill and she was upset over the $2! 

So we did what every vindictive 'Murican does, we took it out of the tip. LOL. Duuuuh... The OWNER then had the audacity to tell us if we come back, we can have a free dessert. Uh... no. 

They also padded our bill with things we didn't order, like bowls of rice and something else.... but they promptly took it off. 

Overall.... just a miserable experience in a stinky rundown place. Will not come back.

The other day I ran across all the Yelp noise about this little 4-months new BBQ joint, and how can you say "No" to trying a place that has 66 out of 70 Reviews at 5 Stars?     :-))

The last time I was here, this was La Canasta Burrito Shoppe, and in my Review it barely earned 3 Stars.  When it closed, Yelp took down all the Reviews, including mine.

So now here we have "Little Miss BBQ."  The floor plan is the same as before, but it's squeaky clean inside now.  Robyn N. and Norm R. joined me for this lunch today and I ordered a 2-Item Combo Plate with 2 slices of Beef Brisket and one large, meaty Pork Spare Rib.  For sides I went with the Cheesy Jalepeo Grits and beans.  Also, a couple of slices of white bread were provided, plus slices of pickle , onion and Jalepeo.

This order was expensive, at $15.  The going price for such a plate of BBQ around the Valley is $11 or less except for $15 at The Barbecue Company's monthly Buffet feast.  It had better be good!     :-O

First off, owner Scott was super nice and friendly.  When we had arrived a little before opening time, we were treated to comfortable patio chairs to relax in and a misty overhead awning to keep the outdoor temperature nice.  Then the small dining room was completely comfortable and OMG, the food!  This was quite possibly the best BBQ I have ever eaten.  Everything was just perfect.

Forgive the homely comparison, but this place reminded me of my car dealer, Earnhart Hyundai of North Scottsdale.  I pay a little more for service there, but they know how to make it a real pleasure to visit the place.  THIS IS THAT, and don't miss letting Scott's dad give you a "tour" of the smoker!     :-))

I know there is a danger in going to restaurants on their first night, but all things considered I think Moira delivered. 

The red miso soup was incredibly flavorful, and plentiful at $6 for a crock that is easily large enough for 4 or more to share. I snuck a few bites of Christine and Myles' ika sansei squid salad which I enjoyed and would order on a future visit. 

We ordered several rolls and I found each to be well rolled and the fish fresh. We tried a Fuji, Philly, and Sakura and each one was great. The other rolls ordered at our table looked equally amazing and I cannot wait to try more of their specialty rolls. (That's not to say the "traditional" roll we ordered wasn't good, it was, but they have a lot of really inventive specialty rolls). The specialty rolls are reasonably priced in a range of $10-13. We did order from the hot kitchen (yaki itame) which I thought was just your basic Chinese dish, with basic flavors. With so many sushi options I'm not sure that I would order the hot dishes regularly. One thing that I do think they do well is portions, the speciality rolls, soup, and entrees were all well sized. 

My husband sampled a karma martini, which he really liked. They serve the martinis out of the shaker table side, which is always a nice touch, but they should think about using smaller shakers because the regular shakers are slightly cumbersome in the tight space and resulted in some inconsistent pours at our table. One of the big hits of the night were their sake bombers- for $9 you get a 22 oz Asahi and mini carafe of sake. Three drinks can easily be made of this. 

The atmosphere was fun, with blue and red lighting throughout and exposed brick. The space has a warehouse feel to it and executes it well in comparison to other places. There is a large sushi bar, as well as various tables in the long, skinny space. I found it to be somewhat loud, but could easily be cozy on a slower night. Although the chairs look like they may not be comfortable, I loved them! 

Our service was a little off, but I attribute that to first night jitters. Our party of 8 ordered a lot of sushi and when the rolls arrived they were on one large platter that was difficult for us to share at a long table. This was confounded by the fact that we had to try to figure out what each roll was since our server wasn't sure. (Granted it's the first night and the place was packed, I assume that this will come with time). Even though the service was obviously hectic because of opening night, the owner Linda was more than gracious and was running around making sure everything was running as smoothly as possible and patrons were happy.  I would love to see Moira offer a Happy Hour, I'm not sure if they do but I didn't see any information about it.  

I anticipate that you will find us at Moira often! Thank goodness for sushi downtown, now all we need is a tapas place!

Some might call me a super-fan, but when Upward Projects does something, you can't help but love it. In the game of artisan pizza, Federal kneads out the competition. 

Having tried most pizzas from their menu, I've landed on the Manifesto as my normal order. I love the Manifesto, with exception of the mushrooms, so when I order it, I always sub for brussels sprouts instead, sometimes I'm feeling a little frisky and have them throw sweet potato on there too. Not only are they happy to make these changes for me, but the server usually says something like "That sounds delicious, I need to try it!"

The manifesto, with goat cheese, red sauce, fennel, schriener's sausage, and brussels sprouts is delish. The toppings are always super fresh, the crust is a bit crispier than most other artisan pizza's from around town and the service is always excellent.

$12 - $15 will buy you a pizza sized well enough for one hungry dude or in my case, large enough for two to share. Joining their email posse will usually score you a free pizza once or twice a year for things like your birthday or promotions they feel like running.

Their vegetable side is neither here nor there in my opinion, likely because I don't love carrots, but the broccolini were delish. 

If you're a dessert fan (remember two deSSerts and one deSert, in case you can never remember how to spell dessert or desert for that matter) they generally always have a fruit cobbler of some sort. If it's mixed berry, you must order it, dessert fans everywhere insist. Oddly enough, I don't order dessert at many places, mostly because I'm generally looking out for my figure, but in this case, I wouldn't be eating pizza either, but when I am, I sometimes order dessert. Go all out right? ;-)

Enough rambling and back to the part we're all waiting for... the end of this review.

Always delish, always fresh, and no one has ever actually gotten fresh with me while dining here, not yet at least. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

This is a little gem.  Sometimes it's best to do one thing and do it really well.  America's does carne asada REALLY well!!  The meat is tender and flavorful and delicious!!  I had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best I've ever had. But let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  If you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  It's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  Their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  My daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  When we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  That's high praise from a six year old!

The shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  Parking can be a little of a challenge.  There is only one way in and it's the same way out.  So if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.  

The staff is always friendly and accomodating.  They make you feel at home.  The prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.  
Thank you America!!

Where do I start with DW Bistro?  First of all DW has been a long time bookmark for me.  I never had the opportunity until recently with a bunch of Yelp peeps. Read the reviews and one thing in common with everyones review is the wait. So, if you're a patient person, DW's is worth if for you.  I'm one of those impatient people, but had no issues hanging out with a bunch of Yelp buds while our table was being prepared. 

Ambiance...so cool.  I love the decor, specifically the art pieces by Pamela Nielsen. One thing about the decor here is that it keeps you calm.  No angry colors anywhere in this joint.  However, the prices to these pieces are pretty expensive even with the DW discount.  If I ever was to meet that sugar mama, the artwork from Pamela Nielsen would be on my list of gifts.  So right now, it's just on my wish list.  But I did get her card for one of those "I don't care about money" days. 

Price is about right for the type of food this place serves.  Food presentation is the key to places like this and DW's definitely got this part right.  All their dishes are well portioned, meaning huge, and the presentation of each dish is prepped so nicely that it made it even tougher to eat.  But for someone like me, this wasn't going to be a problem since food is my number one priority. For brunch, I ended up getting their Filet Mignon and Eggs.  By the way, this dish is not on their normal menu.  This dish comes with two 4 oz filets, 2 eggs, and some bread.  I killed this meal with the quickness so it would be tough for me to say I didn't like it. I love me some red meat and red meat for brunch made meal #3 for the day just perfect. 

Service here is great considering how busy this place gets. We had a party of 10+ and our server dealt with us as best as he can.  Busy is an understatement here.  Yes, you have to get here before they open and line up.  We were one of the lucky ones to be here before opening and I really feel sorry for the folks that waited over an hour just to be seated.  Actually, I don't feel bad. Their bad for coming in late. 

PS:  Vanessa N shout out.  DW Bistro is super super super good.

Gold Dust Woman

Damn I really hate being THAT guy.  You know, the last on one the bandwagon...before everyone else has already jumped off because it's going down in flames.  Well, because of Lil Brown Sugar's Cupcakes, I officially jumped on board (feel free to exit the cabin at any time).

Over the past 3 weeks, I've sampled probably a dozen flavors and all of them were absolutely spot on.  First of all, if you've read any of my reviews of cupcake places (if not, I will find you and tape your eyelids open), I don't like frosting.  Yeah, I'm odd like that, but my kids love that they get an extra dose of kiddy crack.  These are the only cupcakes where I absolutely cannot pass up the frosting.  They capture the essence of the flavor in the frosting, like how Jelly Belly does in a jelly bean.  Seriously!  Here's a rundown:

1.  Key Lime - Hold your butt cheeks together otherwise you'll shit yourself.  The frosting tastes like a fluffy key lime pie.  Well, not "like" a key lime pie...EXACTLY like one.  I actually ate the frosting before the cupcake.  It so light and fluffy it feels like there aren't any calories, just angel dust.  The cupcake itself had a hint of lime, which was nice, but really, it was second fiddle to the frosting.

2.  Butter Beer - I think this was butterscotch cake batter mixed with cream soda topped with butterscotch frosting.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch, but the flavors were so rich and flavorful.  The cake was a little too dense for my wife's taste, but exactly how I like it.  

3.  Peanut Butter Cup - It was a chocolate cupcake with a Hershey Kiss baked inside, topped with peanut butter frosting.  I hate peanut butter, so this wasn't my cup of tea because it tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup (duh).  On the other hand, my wife and mother-in-law thought this was their favorite of all.

4.  Strawberry Lemonade - One of my favorites.  The cupcake is a strong lemon flavor.  Not tart and not sweet.  Just easily identifiable as lemon.  The frosting was on the sweeter side, so I did scrape off about half, but it perfectly complemented the cupcake to the point where it really did taste like a mild strawberry lemonade.  

5.  Orange Dreamsicle - Just like when Ego eats the ratatouille, my hanabata days memories of eating a Meadow Gold orange dreamsicle came rushing back.  This cupcake was like eating a fluffy one, and without the brain freeze.  Of all the flavors I've tried, this is the most subdued, yet highly addictive.

6.  Chocolate Covered Strawberry - Exactly as described, a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting.  Not quite the most memorable, but not too shabby either.  The fact that the frosting is mixed with FRESH strawberries gets points from me.

7.  S'mores - Dude.  Totally tastes like a s'more.  And nowhere near as sweet as a real one.  Chocolate (maybe it was Devil's Food) cupcake with marshmallow whip frosting, topped with crushed graham cracker.  My family still raves about this one.  

8.  Thin Mint Cake Pop - When the lady behind the counter told me it tastes like a Thin Mint, she wasn't kidding.  Sans the snap of the cookie, this thing is choco-minty goodness.  Get two of these and you almost have a box of the real thing.  

9.  Sugar Cookies - I buy these for my rug rats.  Haven't been able to taste them because they're usually gone.  I guess that means they're pretty good.

10.  Red Velvet - Tastes like red velvet.  Although it is exactly as described, I would have to say this is the most boring flavor offered (this statement comes from a guy who LOVES red velvet.  I'm the guy who bought my wife a red velvet birthday cake because hell, if I like it, she better like it too (right?)).  I suggest you do yourself a favor and try anything else in the case.

I would argue that these tasty nuggets don't contain brown sugar.  No, they must have been sprinkled with some gold dust because I'm ready to dig in with my silver spoon.

Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure, you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.  

Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile, willingness to help if I have questions, and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair, I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless, again, a big plus for me.  

When I crave a burger, this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants, cheese, and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!  Especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care!!!

Wow, where do I begin? I think this was by far the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. I came with a group of 8 for lunch at 11am on a Wednesday. We had stopped by earlier in the day and made a reservation and we were looking forward to trying a new spot.

Our waitress (Liz I believe) was the only redeeming part of the entire incident that followed. (If I was rating her I would give 5 stars). Our food orders took an eternity and we watched all the people who had came in after us getting their food. Our waitress stopped by to warn us about the wait on the food, so we ordered some chips to tide us over. 

I ordered the Veggie Rice bowl (which was described as mixed peppers, squash onions, ect and either rice or pasta) I asked for no rice add  the Vegan Carne Asada.

What was brought out came in a to-go container that was about 1/4 full (think typical Chinese food container). I thought perhaps it was the side of carne and inquired with the waitress to see where the rest of the bowl was. (Where was the pasta, grilled veggies ect?) Did someone get hungry and eat it on the way to my table?

She came back with some guy who looked in need of a shower. He asked me what the problem was, and when I explained there was nothing here but the carne asada
 he got defensive and argued with me. There was no offer to bring the pasta, or add veggies. He basically beat on his chest, pushed a menu in my face and told me he was the executive chef "Joey" and that he would never order a rice bowl without the rice. I was astounded at his aggression and rudeness. If I owned this joint he would be out of a job. This is no "House of Tricks" buddy, it's a bar that plays lunch spot by day and your pompous attitude earns no merit badge.

Some other highly medicated looking guy came by later and asked me what the problem was and basically chuckled when I told him and asked if he could do anything. I was afraid the "executive chef" Joey would spit in my food so I declined, I couldn't get out of that place fast enough. Liz apologized and you could tell she honestly felt bad about the exchange. 

I will never come back to this place and I'll  tell everyone I know to avoid it. I've worked on Mill 15 years and have seen hundreds of restaurants fail over the years, I know this one won't last. Not with the absolute insolence and discourtesy they assault their customers with. 

(And they charge $5 bucks for chips and salsa - GET REAL)!

Best Bar in Vegas! 

That's not just an opinion, either! That's a fact! Just ask my buddy David G. He'll tell you what's up!

Located in the beautiful Cosmo Hotel, The Chandelier is a three story bar that's totally enclosed  with millions of shiny crystals, making it seem like you're actually hanging out  in the middle of a huge chandelier. Each level offers different specialty cocktails, which is awesome. The first floor features a small stage where a live band plays (you can hear the band throughout all three levels). Each level has plenty of seating, whether it's on a couch, chair, love seat or a bar stool. 

If you're like me, you like to go to bars to sit back, relax, sip on delicious cocktails, have a nice conversation with the person/group you are with and to also people watch. The middle section of The Chandelier is perfect for the things I just mentioned. If you're more into being seen, trying to hook up or stand around and move from group to group than the first and third floors will be more of your scene. 

I came here three times on my most recent trip to Vegas. I tried a quite a few of their specialty cocktails, all of which were some of the best I've ever had. My favorite drink of the weekend had to be their Fit to be Thai'd, which reminded me of a super strong white Russian with a hint of peanut butter. Yup, I said peanut butter. They actually put a decent sized scoop of PB in this cocktail while they were mixing/shaking it up (I watched them do it). I also really enjoyed their Cereal Killer, which tasted like spiked cinnamon toast crunch cereal milk. I also had and tasted other drinks but their names and what they were made with escape me at the moment. 

All the bartenders (mixologists) and servers I encountered were all super friendly. The prices here are like any other bar in Vegas ($10-$13 per drink)  but the drinks and the atmosphere are 100% better than any of those other bars. 

My favorite thing about The Chandelier is there are no cover charges, no bouncers, no D bags (at least that I saw in all my visits) and there is massive amounts of available seating, even on the weekends. 

The Chandelier is now my go to bar in Vegas.

Received a killer deal for a 4 day/3 night stay at Encore. Turned out to be ~$116/night package that included a Wynn buffet for two for 3 days and two tickets to Le Rve.  Hey that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick any day in my book!

Dang SWEET right?!
I'm saving a lot of money by coming here right?!
They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing right?!

Spent two days playing craps at the Encore Casino.  I wasn't even planning on playing there, but their Craps tables stuck with the $10 minimum all weekend long.  I thought for sure they would raise it to a $25 min, but no such luck.  So I couldn't resist and to my detriment, I lost big time.  I did have a 20+ roll streak and won some of it back.  Drank a lot of "free" Bloody Mary's and Dirty Martini's.  But no matter how you look at it, Encore/Wynn got their money's worth outta me.   Even though I didn't end up with a roll of 100's in my pocket, I did not leave this place disappointed.  (I did end up having enough to buy a Ho Dduk the next time I'm at Koo's ;P) 

The rooms were awesome; roomy suites (requested more shoe polish and they gave me 10 cans of it!), huge spa-like bathrooms accommodated with robes, slippers, and a flat-screen TV.  Also for your viewing pleasure, awesome views of the entire strip or downtown LV.  Part of the deal included free Wi-Fi, and use of the fitness club; a very sweet setup with a juice bar, cold and room-temp bottled water, headphones, and ample sweat towels.  When staying at the Encore/Wynn, you also have access to their "European" outdoor pool where Steve Wynn proudly states that you are free to go topless if desired.  So we went and indeed, there were many uninhibited women who were "propped up" and indeed topless.  More power to them.  Cabaas can be rented on a per/day basis.   

I wish we came to LV to experience more places to eat, but with my losing streak and money leaving my wallet left and right, we ended up eating at the "free" buffet for either lunch or dinner all three days... AND YES, I AM SO SICK OF THE WYNN BUFFET.  Even though we earned another free buffet for two the next time we go, I don't think I'll want to spend any more time there.  The one great thing was the wait service.  The waiters we had were all very nice, cordial, and attentative.  As far as the buffet was concerned nothing to write home about.  I think I did eat about 10 crme brulees as that was all that was memorable.

Le Rve was a watery enigma of a story about a lost lover who is shown a world of the underground, ravaged with temptation, and is always being pulled back and forth until the end.  At least that's my take on it.  But a great production none the less.

recently opened mexican restaurant located in the portuguese neighborhood of le plateau.

decoration is simple and well thought out. nothing cheesy and quirky like you'd find at other mexican restaurants. like we say, c'est pur.

there's 12 counter seats when you enter and many tables in the back. can seat around 50-60 person. seems to have a full bar. the drinks menu is on the chalkboard at the back. cocktails and beers on one side and beer cocktail on the other. price range from $6 (beers) to $9 (cocktails). shots can be had too. didn't ask for the price but most likely around $2-3.

menu is simple. one side is tacos, the other is tortas which are sandwiches. prices for tacos are $12 (except the fish which is $13) and tortas are $8. there's even a vegetarian tortas.

since they have fish tacos, that's what i got. it comes in 4 and dress up with coleslaw. the slaw is fresh but a bit lacking in flavor. it does its job well when paired with the salsa. as for the fish, it's crispy just the way i like and flaky.

the salsas come in 3 variety: the spicy, the avocado and the habanero. the spicy salsa is mild in heat and tasty enough. the avocado is flavorful but a bit lacking in heat. the habanero, that's all heat! a mix of habanero and avocado is the perfect salsa for me.

the drink: i got the chelada which is a spicy beer cocktail. made with clamato, corona, lime juice, tabasco, worcestershire as well as soy sauce and maggi sauce. you get to choose how much heat you want, i went with light which end up being a good thing as you can taste that little je ne sais quoi. i didn't know what that little something was at first but the waitress being really helpful showed me how it was made. when i saw that soy sauce and maggi sauce were used, that's when i knew it was that je ne sais quoi. it all tied together for a flavorful cocktail and with the salted rimmed, i didn't even need the food anymore!

dessert: there's only churros ($2.50) and they are good. comes in 3 and a choice of sauce: chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry. tossed in sugar and drizzle with sauce, they were crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and oh so finger licking good. if only it came with a dipping instead of a drizzle, it'd be perfect.

service: waitress is helpful and very friendly. asking how the food was, how you heard about the place, showing you how the drink was made. can't ask for better! wait time can take a while between order and getting your food (about 20 minutes) but drinks arrived promptly which lets you enjoy and relax and if you have company, get a conversation going.

so in summary, tacos come in 4, churros come in 3 and the beer cocktail is the best deal as you basically get 2 drinks. all for around $25 after tax (excluding tips)

i'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the tacos selection as well as the tortas

Now this is a Hidden Gem! Found in the 4 Queens Hotel & Casino, Downtown Vegas. Take steps down to the Underground Dungeon of a True Throw Back in Time Vegas Mob Style Dining Area.

Every Lady that steps foot in here, receives a long stem red rose.. Brownie points already! We didn't have a reservation but we were given a table in literally a minute and the place was filled. The host was a jokester, had a great sense of humor that definitely set a positive vibe and loosened things up.  2 Servers(1 Server & 1 Assistant Server, Not Busser) immediately pulled out our chairs, and greeted us with much enthusiasm! Without wasting time, they poured their own in-house bottled water into our glasses. Within seconds, our bread basket (basic dinner rolls and  lavash) was dropped off with butter that had been intricately sculpted into a rose bud! 

Menu offered a wide variety and every other entree I grazed at was so appealing. But I was sold on their 21 Day Dry Aged Top Shelf Rib Eye that is char-broiled and served with mushroom ragout and bordelaise sauce.  My girl orders Hugo's Chicken - breast of chicken stuffed with a sun dried tomato pesto and roasted garlic sauce. Both dishes included sides of veggies and mashed potatoes. Not only that, the order also came with their Custom Made Salad and Dessert!!!!! 

Shortly after, a gentleman with this hunky salad cart rolled over and started to toss the  salad and asked what additions I cared for, about 15 different options! I added, creamy pepper dressing, onions, tomato, egg, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, parmesan cheese and croutons (they had anchovies and nuts too..). The lettuce, onions, extremely juicy tomato was farm picked fresh, artichoke hearts and hearts of palms added that lucious subtle flavor, egg, parmesan cheese and croutons just complemented each other wonderfully!! This disappeared in minutes.. 

Then one of the servers handed us over a tiny ice cream cone with a scoop of raspberry sorbet! Nice!

About 10 minutes later, the servers came over with our piping hot plates of steak and chicken. The Steak was a chunky piece of meat that had Flawless grill marks checkered throughout. Fork tender and their mushroom/bordelaise aujus makes this Steak Unrivaled by Most Other Rib Eye's I've Ever Had!

The chicken had an aroma that filled the air with garlic and sundried tomatoes. As good as it smelled, it tasted even better! The stuffing/sauce flavors were expertly balanced with the chicken. Undeniably recommended!

The included sides were small but were a satisfying amount of vegetables, mash potato and pamesan crusted tomato that were all very good.

When we were done, the servers boxed our leftovers and bagged them for carry-out.

Next came the dessert tray, with an assortment of divine looking Treats.. We passed since we had our Chocoloate Covered/Dipped Strawberries, figs and apricot with their homemade whipped cream to come to the rescue! It came swiftly on this propped up cake stand, exactly what we needed to end the night right! Semi-sweet chocolate, flavorful fruits and fluffy whipped cream equals dessert Greatness!

What an Experience! This place has Romance written all over it! Candle-lit dim dining room, Accomodating A+ Service, and Most Importantly this place doesn't Break the Bank! Just be cautious not to crack open too many bottles of Wine!!

This is really a 4.5 star review. I love Jersey Mike's! When I walked in there were plenty of smiling faces and friendly employees. The taste of the food is important obviously, but customer service goes a long way and this location delivers when it comes to both of those things.

When looking at the menu board I was having the hardest time deciding what to order. So many of the subs were something that I would eat. The cool thing about that is, there will be something new I can try out when I go back, so I could end up with a few favorites to rotate between. They offer a "Sub in a Tub" for those of you who do not like your meat between bread. You can just pick any sandwich on the menu and they will make it the same way they would on a sandwich, but put it in a bowl minus bread for you. They have a variety of "Wraps" to choose from. The sandwich sizes are mini (4 1/2 inches), regular (7 1/2 inches), and giant (15 inches) and the bread options are wheat or white. The bread is baked fresh at each location. 

One of the workers suggested "The Original Italian" since it was their most popular sub. It sounded delicious so hubby and I decided to split one of those. The giant for this sandwich was priced at $11.95 and then it jumped to $13.95 before tax with the addition of extra cheese. It had provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. Jersey Mike's uses quality meats and slices it fresh right in front of you. I ordered it "Mike's Way" which means they add onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar, oil and spices. The sandwich was very good! I will order this one in the future for sure. The flavors all melded so well together.

I was very impressed with the knowledge of the employees. The sandwiches on the menu that are numbers 43 and 56 have meaning. The number 43 is the football jersey of the CEO. Apparently he started working for Jersey Mike's (the original on the jersey shore) when he was a teen and ended up buying it later on and shaping it into what it is today. The number 56 is a nod to the year the first Jersey Mike's opened up.

They offer a "Shore Points" reward program. You can sign up and use a card or just give your phone number when ordering to accumulate points towards free sandwiches. 

Parking can be very frustrating at this location. It is tight in this area so please just be careful.

You can also place your order online or by phone.

Catering is available and they have a few different options for that.

Be hungry and ENJOY!

We wanted to BBQ since it was such a gorgeous day outside, so I suggested we give The Butcher Block a try since I had seen such good reviews on yelp. 

I was not disappointed! The Butcher Block is family owned and operated and offeres a wide variety of meats from U.S.D.A. Prime Beef, U.S.D.A. Prime Dry-Aged Beef, Wagyu Kobe Style Beef , Homemade Sausages, just to name some! If you want something on the wild side they offer Gator, Quail, Venison, Elk, Rabbit and plenty of other woodland creatures. Seafood isn't my thing, but they had a good looking variety of stuff including live lobsters and blue crabs. I'm amazed that they had so much to offer for a tiny shop. One thing I noticed was "Jalapeno Bacon" priced at $8.99 each. Compared to what it costs at the grocery store that isn't bad for good quality bacon.

After looking over the selection and wanting pretty much everything, we decided on a few different things to try. I wish I could remember the name (I think porterhouse?!) of the 2 steaks we bought, but I can't. I do know both steaks together cost $35.81 and were worth every penny! I picked put a rub priced at $5.99 for the meat and the steaks just grilled up so nicely and the steak melted in my mouth. We also picked out a "Petite Bacon Wrapped Filet" priced at $5, "Mushroom Caps W/Homemade Sausage" priced at $1 each, "Mini Bell Peppers Stuffed W/Homemade Sausage" priced at $1 each, "Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Jalapenos" priced at $1.50 each and some "Hot Italian Sausages" priced at $4.99 per pound. 

The mushroom caps stuffed with sausage were decent as the peppers stuffed with sausage, but it was the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos that were an awesome flavor explosion in my mouth! I was bummed we didn't get more than 4 of them. The sausages were full of flavor, but not too spicy and grilled up perfectly. The petite bacon wrapped filet is the perfect size and price for the smaller appetite. Perfect for spoiled pooches too! I was very pleased with everything and will be stopping here at The Butcher Block more often.

You can also stop by to pick up a sandwich for lunch because they have Boar's Head meats and cheeses! What The Butcher Block is currently charging for the meats and cheeses per pound is too much compared to where I get it at a store near my house. I do think the prices for having them make you a sandwich with the Boar's Head meats and cheeses though is reasonable. The man who helped us behind the counter was very helpful and inside the shop was very clean.

And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. 

Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. 

Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. 

The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.

P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. 

DO NOT GO HERE.

Right across the street from the Hard Rock, Alexis is a non-gaming resort with a variety of suites offered. It was the perfect setting for my slumber party! 

I originally booked a suite at my beloved Hard Rock hotel but I switched to Alexis per the Hard Rock's fine print: $50 additional fee per night minimum per additional guest above two! I know that people sneak etc. But I am not very sneaky! The Hard Rock is also notorious for charging $500. fees for bumping bottles in the mini bar. Party girls can not be trusted with a bump-charging mini bar! 

There were two suites to choose from, the other had a fireplace in the bedroom which would have been great for a romantic couple. I chose mine for its proximity to the parking and pool. Only $78.20 for a last minute Saturday night after tax! Happy wallet! 

I booked the Alexis Park resort for a girl's night out weekend with low expectations. I wanted a spacious suite to make sure my four+ gal pals were comfortable. We had the time of our lives. At least I did!:-) 

The lobby is stunning, with marble floors, fresh flowers, an unlocked grand piano (they let you play if you are a scholar like yours truly) and a twinkling Christmas tree. Check in was a breeze, the service was perfect. Far beyond expectations. (five stars) 

If you have been to Vegas before, you know how long it can take to walk to the car, to the room or to the pool. All the while you are breathing in about ten cartons of second-hand cigarettes, as your senses are attacked by slot machine screams. -No mi gusta. None of that nonsense here friends. None of your glorious party time is wasted. 

After checking in, I drove around to the back of the resort and parked less than 20 paces from my ground-floor two-room suite. (# 2201, I believe it was) Enormous! The marble wet bar is decked out with bar stools, a coffee maker, a stainless steel sink, cupboards-a-plenty and a microwave. The coffee provided was not bad! We loaded up the fridge with bottles of champagne stat. 

Closets galore, a HUGE living room with posh chairs, a couch with a King size pull-out bed, a TV and enough floor space to practice our break dancing moves, which we took full advantage of. 

The amazing vanity area (blow dryer included) provides enough mirror space for two or three girls to primp at once. The bathroom is stocked with premium Body-Shop bath products, quality bath towels and a huge 10 jet jacuzzi tub! Bubble bath- loving girls rejoice! Once again, we took full advantage! 

The bedroom was smartly furnished in taupe, chocolate and beige. A dresser, two nightstands and two Queen sized beds. I hope I have more pictures to post of this suite. I saw some yelp photographs that looked nothing like the place that I stayed. My suite was prefect. (five stars) 

The grounds are lush, the grass is green and ten paces from my suite, there are three pools to choose from. Crazy cold! Julia, you are nuts for making me jump in that thing! The jacuzzi was great, hot, bubbly and serene. Most important: Not over chlorinated. There are large towels available at the pool, tables, chairs and a water fountain. 

The location is about five minutes from the strip. (three stars) I get the impression that the lower-priced suites upstairs and around corridors are not as posh as mine. My advice? Ask the hotel manager to show you what is available before committing. 

If you want to gamble right outside your door? This is not for you. If you come to Vegas sans car, this is not for you. If you want to break dance in your living room, play the lobby grand piano, get to your car or the pool Dukes-of-Hazard-fast, fill a refrigerator with champagne and jump in your Jacuzzi bath tub with your four favorite gal pals after wild nights of dancing? This is for you! 

I had the time of my life here. I have stayed at the Venetian, Paris, Harrah's, Imperial Palace, The Tropicana, Bally's, Cesar's Palace, the Rio and The Hard Rock hotel. This was my favorite Vegas trip EVER. Some things are so fun, they should be illegal.:-) 

Alexis was very recently remodeled and updated. I was one of the first occupants post remodel. The older linens etc. from past photographs are current no longer:-)

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

Umm, made from scratch Sloppy Joes and fancy Mac and Cheese?? Pshh, you had me at Sloppy baby...

The fact that there are any sub-par reviews of this place shocks the hell out of me. I had my third meal at District last night, and just like my previous two, it was spectacular.

In the business of full disclosure, my friend and I were going to try Moira for the first time, but alas it was closed, and obviously a sign because we stumbled a few blocks further south to District and had quite the satisfying meal.

We walked in about 6:45, and I'm sad to report the place was empty.  We took a seat at a cocktail table in the bar area so I could watch the hockey game (seriously, I am a dream date) and perused the bar menu. A nicely mannered waitress approached us almost immediately and remained attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal.

The coolest thing about the bar menu was their new take on the pairing menu.  No longer do you have to be a wine conosseur to enjoy the Chef's special menu.  District offers three separate 3 course tasting menus, one featuring a wine pairing, one featuring a cocktail pairing, and one featuring a beer pairing all for between $12 and $14!  I mean, how cool is that?  I challenge you to find a better bargain for such high-quality fare complete with booze...give it up, you can't, I've looked.  If you don't know already, District offers about 10 or 12 different Microbrews on tap an obvious plus for a beer drinker like myself.

Being the difficult diner that I am, I asked for the Sloppy Joe Sliders off the beer pairing menu so I could get a couple other small things and try a bunch.  Yes, I am an adult, and no, I can't not order a Sloppy Joe when it is featured on a menu, I'm sorry, I just can't.

And thank goodness I lack that sense of propriety because the Sloppy Joe Sliders were freaking fantastic!! 3 perfectly sized mini toasted buns filled with possibly the best, spiciest Sloppy Joes I have ever eaten. Seriously, I sucked down my Apricot Ale seemingly in seconds thanks to the District's take on this classic!  Just don't tell my Mom, she still convinced I'm quite fond of her Mamwich Joes...

I also had to get a side of their Andouille infused Macaroni and Cheese, another embarrassing thing that I just can't not order if it's offered on a menu, and it did not disappoint.  Cheezy, creamy, gooey perfection. My only complaint is that I was so full from my Joes I barely made a dent in my Mac n Cheese...alas, there's always next time.

My dining companion ordered what must have been the biggest freaking burger I have ever seen, but to be honest I did not really look or care because I was far too enamored with my meal to be distracted by anything else.

All in all, I had a spectacular meal at the District, from beginning to end.  If you haven't checked out this gem at the new Downtown Sheraton, do yourself a favor, you'll be in for a treat.

Hoi..1st to Review!

Give Manila's Best - A Taste of Home some lovin'!  It's a brand spankin' new place for some delicious Filipino eats!  Just opened about a week and a half ago.  Please check it out!

I'm a new fan because:

1) The owner is a cool dude!
2) The restaurant is clean!  The bathrooms are clean!
3) The food is good!

I cannot tell you how much a clean restaurant does for its reputation.  Being brand new you would expect cleanliness and Manila's Best has it in spades.  Let's hope they can keep it up this way, I feel much better eating in a place that pays attention to proper hygiene.

Like Filipino food from the Homeland? Manila's Best is the newest, tastiest place to go!  Seriously, the food here is down-home country, not pretentious, and tasty.  Yes, Filipino food tends to be heavy, but the folks here at Manila's Best keep the greasiness to a minimum.  Nothing on the line was sitting for too long or drowning in its own grease.

Here's some of the tender vittles on their menu:

-Rice (lots and lots of white rice)
-Bistek
-Pork Adobo
-Chicken Adobo
-Beef Afritada
-Grilled Pork Belly (damn delicious)
-Pancit
-Pork Sinigang (mmmm....sour)
-Chicken Tinola
-Fried Tilapia
-Fried Chicken Skin


I ate all of it...and loved it!  For me, I'm an Americanized Filipino and I noticed their food is lighter on the bagoong/patis side of the palette.  Which is a plus for me because DAMN sometimes my Nanay & Tatay are a bit heavy-handed on the fermented fish stuff!  But for you old skool' Filipinos I'm sure Manila's Best has some bagoong or patis on the side they can give you in case you're looking for that fishy feeling.

Manila's Best is really the best of both worlds, you can either enjoy a 2 or 3 item combo which includes rice and soup for under $7.  Or you can be a lechon like me and go all out for their special BUFFET....all-you-can-eat gloriousness for only $7.99 total!  Soft drink and tax already included!  Plus they give real plates, bowls, and silverware so you can feel like you're having a meal at home.  Things like that really add up to a great experience here.

I really enjoyed Manila's Best, and they are looking for customers!  It was lunch rush today (on a Payday Friday) and the place was near empty.  So sad, poor thing!  These folks need a push from some social media.  And I am here to help with my outstanding review!

So you like-a-da Filipino food, please visit Manila's Best!  Your belly and your wallet won't be sorry!  Best price of $7.99 for their lunch and dinner buffet!  You go now!

I think I will be going there again tonight.

MASARAP!

I have been wanting eyelash extensions for awhile now. I was given a groupon voucher for this place from a friend for my birthday. I scheduled an appointment to get lashes put on and was able to come in the same day. I was greeted by gal and quickly taken into this dim low lighting area where everyone sits next to each other. The chairs were very closely placed and I felt no privacy what so ever. I felt very uncomfortable knowing my purse was laying next to many other people that can walk away with it while my eyes were closed. I wanted to walk out already at that point but decided to wait it out.

She took me to a chair and told me to lay down. I don't even know her name because she failed to introduce herself. She didn't ask me what's my name either which I thought was rude. She didn't bother asking me what length I wanted or explained to me my options. So laid me down and asked me to close my eyes. I didn't know what to expect and was waiting for her to ask me what type of look I wanted. I thought that she'll be asking me with my eyes closed so that I can relax since the chair was comfortable. She did offer me some wine which I turned down. I was there to get lashes put on, not to get drunk. Again, where's my consultation? Let's get it out of the way so I can feel at ease knowing the final outcome. Nope! I never got one.

She started on my eyes without asking me one single question regarding my likes/dislikes. After I felt her applying the lashes, I asked a her if she started already. Her response was " yes, and you'll love them when I finish." Wth?! How do you know I'll like them if you didn't ask me what I like? But okey... I didn't have much of a choice since she already started on them. I was praying with my eyes closed hoping they'll turn out nice. After 3 hours of pulling, tugging, and yanking, she told me to open my eyes. It burned so bad that I couldn't open them. Tears kept running and my eyes were burning. It took about 15 more minutes for me to be able to open my eyes. When the burning went away, I realized I still couldn't open my eyes. They were glued stuck to my bottom lashes. She kept telling me to open my eyes and that she needed me to get off the chair since her next client was there. She said if it still burns then I can go up front and sit in the waiting area to wait for it to go away. I told her that my eyes are glued shut and I can't open them. She said sorry but the lighting there is really poor due to the lounge look which caused her to not be able to see well. She said she probably accidentally glued some of my lashes to my bottom lashes. She took a pair of scissors and snipped away. A lot of my bottom lashes were cut off. I asked for a mirror to see how they turned out. She pointed to the ladies room and told me to check in there. She said she can't waste any more time on me since her client is waiting. She basically brushed me off and told me to get off her chair. That was really uncalled for!

I was overly upset and didn't want to use the ladies room to look at my lashes. I went upfront to pay and asked to talk to the manager regarding the service I was provided. The guy up front told me that he was the manager and there's nothing he can do since the girls are on commission, they can pretty much make their own rules. He said since I'm paying with groupon, they don't make any money so the amount of time that they spent on my lashes was more than what I paid for. I wasn't expecting such a rude response from management. I was speechless and walked away.

The first thing I did when I went to the car was look at my lashes. Oh my god! I was terrified!! They were super long. Hooker long to be exact! Not only that but I noticed my lashes were glued together in chunks. I felt like going back in to scream at them for ruining my lashes and cutting half of my bottom lashes off. But I knew the response I was going to get from the manager since he told me earlier nothing he can do. Why bother...

I quickly made an appointment with Cherry lash lounge to redo my lashes. I have an appointment to come intomorrowto get them fixed. Hopefully this time will be a better experience and that they'll be able to fix my lashes. I'll update my experience with cherry once I go in. Wish me luck!

Aloha! I know it's odd getting Hawaiian food in Vegas but apparently, they do have a huge population of Hawaiians, thus the good restaurants you'll find here. Island Flavor is one perfect example.

We started with their very fresh shoyu POKE for appetizers. Half an order is half a pound for $7.25. It's hefty so it really is a steal! Color, taste, and texture of the tuna passed our standards with flying colors. 

With so many good things on their menu, it's rather convenient that they offer you the option to order a MIXED PLATE ($11.25) with two items and a side of rice (white or brown) plus salad or macaroni salad. Kalbi is an extra $1 but trust me when I say it's money well-spent. FURIKAKE CHICKEN and KALBI were my two choices. The chicken had a beautiful sweet and sour glazed exterior with seaweed flakes drizzled on it. Each bite had a good crisp and could make you work on a chew, but in a good way. The Kalbi beef was marinated and grilled to perfection pleasing my tastebuds while getting envious looks from others on the table who didn't order this. I looooove their macaroni salad here so don't be like my sister who opted to get a salad of greens and regretting it shortly after having a taste of my side order. 

The ROASTED PORK are shreds of meat doused with their own version of gravy that is out-of-this-world delicious. The taste reminds me so much of eating "lechon", a Filipino dish which is literally, roasted pork. In addition, their CHICKEN KATSU is remarkably right on the money. The breading was great in all aspects and how everything held together execution-wise was simply perfection. Our server messed up our order and gave us Korean chicken wings instead of the katsu in the beginning but she fixed it right away without even taking back the wings. Their KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS was bone-in with crispy skin outside and juicy meat inside. Flavor profile was good but I've had better. Bottom line, it's free so I can't complain.

It seems like the CHICKEN KATSU LOCO MOCO is the deal here so we also ordered that to share. An order is ginormous just like everything else we had. We only consumed half of it and took the rest home but the rave reviews on this dish is true to its words. A specialty not to be missed indeed!

Their GUAVA CAKE ($5) however was easily almost everyone's highlight on the table including those without a sweet tooth. Pair with it their refillable Kona coffee because there's just no other way for you to end a meal here. Ahhhfreakingmazing! Not only is it pretty in pink but the cake itself is moist and each layer of icing and guava syrup delivered its purpose giving you that tropical flavor you thought you could only get from the islands. Easily the best thing I ate here!

Service was a bit spotty, almost like on island mode but nonetheless they were friendly. With onolicious food, generous portions, and reasonable pricing, it's worth the little drive off the strip. 4.5 Stars!

I admit it...I like potato chips:)

Back when there was about 60 pounds more of me to love, you could say I really liked potato chips:)

But still, if you are looking at the classic "nutrition pyramid"...potato chips are stuffed in there at the tippy top, along with perfectly grilled bone-in rib eye's, single malt scotch whiskey and Dungeness crab legs...all good things and good for you, too:)

At the Village Tavern, they have an appetizer called Colorado Potato Chips...freshly fried potato chips...with a bunch of junk on them.

But, if you ask them nicely, they will bring you just a plate of the chips, all fresh and warm and salty, right out of the fryer...without all the rest of the toppings:)

Now that's an accompaniment:)

A grace note, if you will:)

The Beautiful Carin and I stopped by the other evening... we hadn't been there in several months, and Sarah G's review reminded me that I have missed the good old Village Tavern.

They pour a nice drink at the VT and have a " 1/2 price on any and every drink" Happy Hour, so we had a couple of inexpensive KetelOne marti's and decided to have an early dinner:)

I had the Maple Cured Pork Chop and Carin had their Teriyaki Chicken...both were very good!

At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)

I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)

In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)

They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)

The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)

I never feel that the staff is trying to "optimize" me or turn the table quickly.

And finally, in a rare "double", I need to give a five star shout out to the Village Clubs...by showing my membership card for the Village Clubs at VT, I get a 15% discount on the entire bill:)

I know...it's a chain and I do like to buy local, but come on...Village Tavern has those potato chips...Fresh, Warm, Perfect Potato Chips!

Potato Chips...Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in:)

The story of two hippies and finally, a great idea.

In a land filled with broken dreams and grumbling tummies, two hippies met while attending a Phish concert. Recognizing each other as hippies by their standard issue, Grateful Dead t-shirts, big daddy; as he preferred to be called, introduced himself to Little "T". In this moment, the clouds parted while angels played their harpsichords and trumpets from a Farmhouse. "Hey, you like burgers?" Little "T" asked big daddy. "Hhhehheehee, of course. You ever seen the northern lights?" asked big daddy.

... fast forward seven years ...  Little "T" finally had a great idea. "Hey big daddy, wouldn't it be cool if there was a burger shop where all the hungry people could come and eat a burger, fries, and a drink for just a dollar?" "No way man, burgers are like heaven and people would pay like, $10 for an awesome burger, fries, and a drink." he replied.

After years of debating and three failed marriages between the both of them, "T" and daddy settled on $5 as a great price for burger, fries and a drink. Today, you can find this $5 meal in Central Phoenix 365 days a year, except Sundays, holidays, between the hours of 8pm and 11am, or from 4:20 to 4:21 -- hippies gotta sleep; and, you know... 
;-)

Stop in for lunch one day (or dinner), order up their daily special, their house bacon cheese burger, or even a hot dog. While considering your options, browse the toppings list such as, fresh jalapenos, roasted hatch chili, caramelized onions, onion rings, house made habanero ketchup, and more. 

Side note to all you spicy food extraordinaires, the habanero ketchup is down-right fantastic. In fact, I think this ketchup steals the show. While greasy burger spots aren't on the normal "bucket list", if you love spicy food and in some weird way make a list of all the places you wish you could try before you die, you NEED to add this to the list. I almost wish I could buy a batch of this stuff to take home - OMG that was spicy!

Oh, the burger and steak cut fries aint bad either ;-) I ordered the bacon cheese burger, sans the tomato, add jalapenos and a side of that delish house made habanero ketchup. It was a burger like none other I've had!

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Pancakes. I hate pancakes. 

Just kidding. Ever since I changed my icon to Grumpy Cat, I've been writing more 2-star reviews. Coincidence? I don't know. What I do know is that, Du-Par is an LA institution, and in my best grumpy face, I hated it. 

I've been to the Du-Par's in LA, and I remember it was unmemorable but I didn't hate it. I think it's the overall vibe of the LV location and the fact that there's so many better options within walking distance that left a distaste in my mouth. 

Firstly, if this review as based solely on the pancakes it would be 5-plus stars. Pancakes are awesome. Fluffy, crispy, buttery, all at the same time, the way pancakes were meant to be. A full stack will run around $10 but it's well worth it. 

Another winner is their shrimp cocktail. For $3 you get a sundae cup's worth of medium sized shrimp with some crazy-good cocktail sauce. I liked it better when you they sold these at the snack bar but it's still a bargain but now you have to pay tip and sit down and be waited upon. 

So... if the pancakes and shrimp are that good... why the two-stars? Everything pretty much negated the awesomeness of the pancakes. Their chicken soup was horrible, a sloppy mess of noodles with little to no chicken. They had a video playing that showed they make their noodles from scratch, which is what prompted me to get it. I love fresh made noodles, they're so light and airy. But I've found that if you overcook them, there is no forgiveness, they become a mushy mess! They're even worse than overcooked store-bought noodles. And these noodles tasted like they've been cooking all day. Gross. 

The bf got the Vegas fried chicken, which was ok, but hardly worth the $9.50. It was an extra $3 for a less-than-par side salad. 

Service was really sketchy. They switched out waiters during our meal and our second waitress seemed lost. Food came out slow. Orders were forgotten at the table next to us. They forgot one of our drinks. 

Overall, just not an enjoyable experience. My bf loves their shrimp cocktail but he'll have to go by himself, I doubt I'll come back after this visit. I just don't like pancakes that much.

We went to the Urban Tap this past Sunday for Brunch.  I LOVE brunch... The only early meal that's not only acceptable to booze, but encouraged!  After searching a few other Brunch stops we agreed we were intrigued by their menu.  What initially was going to be a group brunch turned into an intimate meal with my husband and friend Chelsea S in the good ole Saaahside.  

Parking here was so convenient, something not to be taken for granted in the South Side.  There is a lot basically right next to the restaurant that is free on Sundays.  We arrived shortly after noon, the atmosphere was very nice, modern, and I absolutely loved the open windows at the front of the place giving it a lovely airy feeling on a beautiful pre-autumn day.  I already cheated, as I usually do, and studied the menu online prior to brunch so I was pretty set on what I was going to order, as was the hubs.  Please note, the menu provided online is not exactly correct and does need updated.  For instance, they no longer offer bottomless mimosas.  You can order a carafe for $10.00 which gives you about 5-6 glasses.  I also noticed their online menu mentions pork belly in a few dishes but their actual menu has no such reference.  All was ok, as we order a carafe of mimosas which turned into 3 carafes before we concluded.  I chose the Breakfast Pierogie Saut, as the H got the Eggs Benedict two ways.  Both dishes online said "pork belly" but in house it was I believe sausage in mine and a cured ham in his.  

The wait staff was pleasant, efficient, and never let us wait long for service.  Our food came out in a reasonable time, actually almost perfect for brunch meaning not too quick, but not too long, so we had time to chat and drink and enjoy the leisure of Sunday Brunch like one should.  When our meals were served they did not disappoint.  My saut as I can detail contained a type of hash mixed saut veg and sausage, with a nice balance of sweet and heat, topped with two plump pillow pierogies, laying underneath two sunny side up eggs finally topped with some mustard.  The richness of the egg yolk when cut through rolled throughout the dish coating all elements that lay beneath.  It was quite delectable, perfect portion, at a very reasonable price.  I tried the eggs benedict and it was also really good, but I would have liked more hollandaise as it was mostly drizzled on the eggs.  The cornbread base was unique.  Never had a benny prepared like that.  Again very distinctive and original.   

We stayed for a couple hours enjoying our food and drinks, actually long enough that many people were filtering in for the lunch fare.  We noticed many other dishes coming out that looked amazing and smelled even better.  I think I will have to come back here to try their other menus soon...

Highland Dr and Industrial Rd are better known for their close proximity to the Las Vegas glittery night life, where even the least physically attractive individuals can lease the personal attention of barely clothed seductive sirens $20 at a time.  But thanks to Rollin' Smoke Barbeque, this same area will also be known for down to earth, simply delicious BBQ. 

On a recent weekday evening, a handful of coworkers decided to meet here post work to try some BBQ that Nelson Q has proudly put his 5 Yelp stars stamp of approval on. In typical fashion, I was the first to arrive.  The parking lot was empty except for 2 cars, all the other businesses were closed, and there was a guy in suits finishing his early dinner.

The restaurant itself is very low key. It housed nothing flashy in terms of decorations, except for a big boar's head mounted on one of the walls. The lobby/ordering counter is in a small room, but the main dining area is in the adjacent room. The seats are comfortable, and there is a TV for you to watch sports or highlights, while you wait for your order.

Most of us opted to try the Outlaw Burger. For $6.99 + tax, this burger is the size of two of my fists stacked on top of each other.  It is packed with a 1 lb patty (60% brisket and 40% ground beef) and cooks down to about 12 oz, served with Rollin' Smoke's homemade tangy BBQ sauce, the usual vegetable fixings and some (lettuce, tomato, fried onions, scallions, and cheese) which not only made it physically big but the flavors complimented each other and resulted in a mean serving of burger that I can easily recommend to anyone not opposed to eating pork and beef.  For $2, you get a drink and choice of one side (bacon potato salad would be a good pick), and make your order a combo.  Currently there is also a Yelp Check-In promotion, where you get a complimentary dessert with your order.

Rollin' Smoke BBQ, now my personal #1 one pound burger in LV.

Decor:  3/5  No frills hole in the wall restaurant. You are here because you want good BBQ, not design ideas for your Texas ranch.

Food:  4/5  Good BBQ made with passion and love.  They serve Blue Belle ice cream too (coworkers said it reminded them of the ice cream in the Philippines. I will take their words for it.)

Value:  4/5  Good for the wallet. I estimate that 65%+ of you will not be able to finish the Outlaw Burger, side + drink.

Location:  5/5  Not far at all if you are visiting the Strip.  The cabbies will probably know it too, if not, it is just down the street from Sapphire. 

Parking:  5/5  It is practically all for Rollin' Smoke BBQ customers.

Easily 4 stars!

P.S.  If you stop by during lunch, I heard this is where some of them sirens get their lunch/breakfast before/after work. So I've heard.

I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.

The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?

About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.

We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.

The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.

The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.

The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.  
It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent.
"What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.  
I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.  
"Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU."
"You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this."
"I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight)
"You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?"
"I'm the owner.   I don't care."

A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."

You think?!    


Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.

Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.  
$7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.  
~
On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order.
~
It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.
     -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there
Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."  
"I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend.
"You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing."
"Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."

.......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.

WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:

I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough.
Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.  
A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.

As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.  

"Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.  

I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away.
I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.

But she let me go, and now I know why.

Mr Gyro doesn't need my business.
Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.

And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess 

Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.

Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. 

Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. 

Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.

The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.

So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Breakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11
Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16

Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts,

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

4/7/10

Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!

Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].

The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and "dirty" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities ("colleges" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!

Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying "I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!

Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!

Training is not a four letter word.  Some of your employees need more in depth training.  More on that later.

We stopped in here on the way home last night because I had seem some Facebook posts by SkinnyFATS that were quite enticing and I wanted to give the new location a try.  

First the food.  I ordered a Doggy Style for myself and a Mac-a-briochious for my wife.  I got truffle fries with mine and garlic fries came with the other.  The FB posting describes the Doggy Style this way:  a tempura bacon wrapped Hebrew National hot dog, tempura jalapeos, spicy cheese, sauerkraut, diced tomatoes, onions, and rouge Dijon.  It was very good.  The highlight for me was the tempura jalapeos.  They were more tempura than anything else on the plate.  

My wife's Mac-a-briochious is described this way:  a garlic brioche stuffed with macaroni, creamy marinara, pepperoni, mozzarella, and basil, served with garlic parmesan fries.  She really enjoyed the man and cheese in the brioche and the garlic fries that came with it.  She described a good garlic flavor in both the brioche and the fries.  We also got an iced tea for each of us.

The food was outstanding.  The training needs work.  Here's that story.  I waited behind some folks who were studying the menu.  They told me to go ahead.  At the register, the young man advised me when he finally looked up that the line was behind me in a loud enough voice that the people who told me to go in front of them heard him and explained they had told me to go.  "OK, what do you want?" was his next statement.  I ordered the Doggy Style and theMac-a-briochious.  He didn't know the prices nor what the meal included so he reached over to a digital photo viewer on the counter and manually ran the photos one at a time until he could get the price of each item.  Then he went through the photos a second time to see what was included with each.

He gave me the total of $26+ and I handed him two $20s.  He then looked at me and said, "It's $26+."  I just stared at him and he looked at the money and then said, "Oh, you don't need to give me any more."  As I was getting my wallet back out to put my change, he told me I had given him enough, I didn't need to pay more.  Duh!

At the beginning he asked what the number of the table was where we were sitting.  I pointed to where my wife was seated.  After the payment, he gave me a number for the table so the person delivering the sandwiches would know who got what.  Duh #2.

They have the same salt and pepper shakers as the original location.  Perhaps some have walked away with people who think they're cute.  There was no salt or pepper on our table.  I looked at adjoining tables and there was none there either.  I got up and got one from a table at the end of the row.  The salt was empty.  We had to ask two servers for a new shaker before we finally got one.  

SkinnyFATS, I like your creativity and how your food tastes.  Get your act together at this new location.  Training is not a four letter word.

This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!

My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.

Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. 

Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. 

We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. 

This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!

I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.
Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.

I will never, ever return.

When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.

We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.

Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.

A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.

He approaches me and says "Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?"
Me: "Excuse me?"
BT: "You're making a mess"
Me: "I would like to order a drink, not get hassled"
BT: "I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips"
Me: "Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment"
BT: "Are you going to order or not?"

I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.

He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.

He returns with the receipt. On the "tip" line I write "NoFuckingWay!"
I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.

A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.

Yes, I am cut off.

I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.

I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.

Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.

I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.

Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this "manager" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.

This "manager" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm

I will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.

Had some time to kill, so I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat and watch the Cowboys vs Eagles Sunday night football game.  It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!

The waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!

As most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!

I asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.

To wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!

After a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!

So....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.

I'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!

Overall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!

Other things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!

Will I return?  As the Macho Man Randy Savage would say......Oh Hell Ya!

This is another 3.5 star restaurant on Yelp that I feel is a little more deserving of 4 - 4.5 stars rather than the 3.5 it actually has. 

As you can see by my checkins, I've been here a couple times. I started coming here right before they moved. I was actually quite worried because I had fallen in love with one of their dishes and was told by my waiter that the restaurant was closing for remodeling in a week and they weren't sure if they would even have a Marinelli's at the M Resort anymore. Just my luck! And whatever they were putting there was top secret and even staff wasn't privy to what was happening. I was so bummed because I had finally found a place where I could get my pasta with vodka sauce craving in check, as evidenced by the Yelp tip I left here & now, in the blink of an eye, everything was all in limbo. 

Well... what ended up going down was that they remodeled the old Marinelli's spot and gave that space to the new Jayde Fuzion restaurant and moved Marinelli's to where the old Anthony's Oyster Bar once was & renamed it Marinelli's Pasta Bar. 

I was pleased to see that I didn't lose my beloved restaurant after all! I have major issues with losing a faved place to order Penne ala Vodka ever since Ago in the Hard Rock closed down. I still have yet to recover from that whole experience and have been searching high and low for a similar place to get my fix ever since. So... I always order the same thing here. I get the Penne ala Vodka off the menu but then I get all high maintenance on them and have them add prosciutto (to make it like the dish I fell in love with at Ago) along with roasted garlic slices & crushed red pepper flakes. I recommend my fave concoction with a glass of the Prisoner wine. I also really enjoy their Caprese Salad.

Service is excellent here... Particularly if you sit at the bar. The seating is very comfortable and there's plenty of room, so you aren't giving up anything by sitting at the bar as opposed to a table. Plus, if you need anything, there are at least two chefs right there cooking in front of you that you can ask as well as your waiter.

I must say a big thank you to the M Resort for keeping Marinelli's around. I am going to keep patronizing their restaurant for as long as I am eating carbs. :)

We skipped WNW last season because almost all first year parks have growing pains to deal with.  (Cowabunga Bay visitors will experience this too.  The park is expected to open in five weeks, yet they just started putting the first slide together!)  

When we learned that WNW would be open for Spring Break I decided to buy four gold season passes.  In just one week, we have already gotten our money's worth.
We visited the park three times this week and had a great time.  We were even able to cash in three guest passes.  

The negative reviews come from people who did not plan well, or had unreasonable expectations.  If you do some planning, you can avoid a lot of hassle.  Here are some of my tips-

1. The water is pretty cold, but it should be.  This is not a spa.  When it's 90+ degrees outside the water feels great once you get used to it.  

2. If you are local, the gold pass is the way to go.   Single day tickets are not a good value.

3. Lines will be long on the weekends during the summer, just like any other park.  Odds are, we will never go on the weekends once school is out.

4. Wear water shoes or flip flops at all times.  You can hold flip flops going down the slides.  The concrete will tear up your feet.

5. Don't even try to sneak drinks or food in.  Your bags will be searched.  Just keep food in the car and have a picnic in the giant park area and get your hand stamped.  If you are seen with outside food, you will be asked to throw it away or be escorted out of the park.  Even sunflower seeds. You are allowed to bring a sealed bottle of water. Not a water bottle.  

6. Make sure everyone in your party is at least 42 inches tall.  Anyone shorter will have very limited things to do.  There are only two slides that require you to be 48 inches.

7. Enjoy the people watching.  The terrible tats and middle aged women with artificial chest enhancements are incredibly amusing.  They think they are pretty hot.  

8. The food is not bad at all.  Cough up the $12.99 to get the WNW cup.  Then enjoy 99 cent refills all season long. (free refills the day of purchase) The waffle fries and pizza are serviceable.

9. Carrying the rafts up four to five flights of stairs is a pain, but not as bad as people make it out to be.  They are rafts full of air.  They are more awkward than heavy.  

10. If you are a season pass holder try and go to the park during non-peak times.  Of course the place will be busy on the weekend.  Duh!

My daughter and I were in line to get in at 9:45 yesterday morning.  When we got in we found two chairs by the river and set up shop.  Within 80 minutes we had rode each slide in the park at least twice.  We were out the door at noon when the crowd was just starting to pour in.  Had we not already spent two full days there this week, we would have stayed longer.  We felt our mission was accomplished.

For those who complain that WNW is small and are looking forward to Cowabunga Bay, I have some bad news for you.  WNW is currently 41 acres, and Cowabunga Bay will be 22 acres.  In addition, WNW owns an additional 71 acres to expand upon, and Cowabunga Bay is land locked in most directions.

When I was 28 years old, I started drinking alcohol. I'm now 30. Before I started drinking, I had a certain amount of knowledge about the world. Let's say, for example, I had accumulated 28 knowledge points. A mere two years later, I would say I'm at 56 knowledge points. I have learned much more about life than I would have ever predicted. I've gained 700 Facebook friends. I've garnered stories that would make a porn star, new to the industry, of course, blush. It's difficult to shock the DV/DA-hardened veterans (physically impossible btw - if you have video to prove otherwise, I'll pay to see it). I've punished my body with 10 day benders. I've had the shakes from withdrawal. I've known two consecutive sun rises and sun sets with no sleep. A navy seal, I am not. A grizzled drinking veteran, yeah, a little bit. Abu J, I know you're gonna call me a light-weight. I grant you, there is always more to learn. My parents generously endowed me with a hardy appetite for rock superstardom, but selfishly withheld the genes for a functioning musical ear and a giant member. Thanks for nothin, mama. 

(Interesting side note - one of my ex gf's thinks my mom and I are in love. This comes from a woman who communicates with her mom once a fiscal quarter.)

But then Andrew K was in my car one day and he INSISTED we listen to the country station. And a song came on by Phil McGraw... Yup, Dr. Phil.  

I think Ill take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now its time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey my next thirty years Im gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things Ive done
Maybe now Ive conquered all my adolescent fears
And Ill do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years Im gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what Im doing here
In my next thirty years

Oh my next thirty years, Im gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe Ill remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years

This song struck me. Right in the baby maker. What a fucking loser I have become... 

I have in many ways downgraded the parts of my humanity that society values. I was productive in my past life. Had a solid career path. A brilliant, ridiculously talented woman loved me. With visceral fortitude, I have displaced entirely the concept of self-discipline. Of a work ethic. The desire to work just a little harder than the schmuck next to me... No, not you Z. But in other ways I love who I've become. I'm charming. I'm easy, whatever you want to take that to mean. I don't judge anyone for anything, except my exes, who I seem incapable of forgiving (just kidding Amber). I find it incomprehensibly energizing to meet new people. On many levels, if I weren't me, I would at least want to be my friend. That's how much I like who I've become. 

So the point of all this... You had to know I would get there eventually, is that I need to find a balance. A balance between where I've been, where I am and where I see myself going. 

Whole Foods is that answer. It is THE answer. They have the right products for me to learn to be a better human. A balanced carbon-based humanoid. They have shampoo that makes my scalp tingle. Soap that makes my privates tingle (BUY IT). They have food that makes my tongue tingle. 

One area that I'm really focusing on right now is my diet. According to the enneagram, I'm an average 7, which is an excessive hedonist. And I've totally been a pig of the epicurean sty... I was an unrepentant glutton. The only thing that kept me under 220 lbs was vanity. Even as a vegetarian. But I've always known, in my little ticker, that I should live as cruelty-free as possible. So, one area I'm implementing discipline is in the diet sector by becoming a vegan. Unfortunately, the selection at WF is so good, I don't even have to employ any discipline. I can eat the same shit I've always eaten and it's delicious and no poor creature had to suffer for it. Life is almost too good. How did this happen?

I could go on. This place rules. I love it so much. Like the love affair I'm having with my mom.

Okay so I have to give them 5 stars. Why?

Well, from my previous Yelp review, I got a message from their guest relations apologizing for my unpleasant visit. Had wrote to me saying that me + 1 would get a comped admission + 1 complimentary drink each. Wow! :] 

I gave them a call on Saturday night, explained the message to them, and was told I would get a call back. 2 hours later, I get a call from one of the security guards at Marquee and said that everything was arranged. 

Arrived at Marquee at around 12:45 ish..and with nooo problem whatsoever, we got to cut the line, got our free admission, and the security guard who's name is Joe handed my bf and I 4 complimentary drink tickets. Now that is great customer service. Definitely more than what we expected. 

A much better experience this time. For both of the bars we went to (hip hop room and main room), they didn't have any milk to make my bf's White Russian. :/ 

They seriously need to make the hip hop room bigger! Why so small for?! Good music though, loved it. Love the balcony outside as well. Has a great view. 

One thing I don't like about Marquee though, is too many stairs to walk up and down to to get to the other rooms. 

Main room dance floor is ridiculous. People, do not dance with your elbows up. You're going to hit someone, and cause a freakin' fight. Which was reallly close to happening. 
Felt like anchovies in a can. Pushed a couple of elbow dancers. 

Main room bar..idk about that bartender. He made me the worst Midori Sour I've ever had. I feel like he put pineapple juice in it?????!?!?!?!?! It was undrinkable..but I drank it. :/ 

Other than that..thank you to both Jennifer and Joe for that night. Everything was great!

I went here with my boyfriend on the night of the Zombie walk as we had planned to go after our Zombie trek from Luxor. We lucked out and went on the night of the Zombie walk all dressed up so drinks at the two bars here were only $5 each. I had one Tequila sunrise at the bar downstairs before going into the Goretorium and later two upstairs at baby dolls lounge after. 

The adventure through the Goretorium is fun and a neat experience. It is not very scary however as I am a big baby and get scared easily. I found that the actors were less scary/horror and more real/normal. A few times I jumped but not the kind of scares that I had hoped for or have been fearing.

The experience is fun and we did get our las vegas locals discount for $25 per person. That is a bit steep for what you get as after tax for two of us it was $57 and some change.

The best part of the whole experience was taking photos with the staff, characters and that made it worth the trip.

Is just too bad that this is one of those things you only need to do once in a lifetime.

I think I will go check out what the Freakling Bros here in town have to offer with their haunted house. I am in need of a real scare where I produce those blood curdling screams of horror and terror!

The end of your walk through the Goretorium leads you out to the baby dolls lounge where you can stay for a drink or just leave. 

The baby dolls lounge is one of those places where they cater to the rich and famous. Many sections were roped off for VIP and they had many staff members with their security headsets that just seem to ruin any sort of relaxed lounge feel. We were even booted from the chairs we were seated at, a security fellow comes over rudely and says to us sorry but I am going to "steal" this table and chairs from you. Yes I shit you not he looks at us and says that while seating another couple. That was rude as fuck and I will not be back and I am a local. 

I am glad we got to check out the Goretorium before they go out of business. After Halloween shall pass their just won't be enough traffic with the price to get in or the snobbish staff at baby dolls lounge to keep it going. It is all about word of mouth and baby my mouth is big!

The two stars are for the Awesome characters that are more than happy to stop and take a photo with you. If not for the cool photos we got I would have been super disappointed with the experience!

WHERE THE BIG EASY MEETS VIVA LAS VEGAS

   The Orlean's is a New Orleans themed hotel & Casino. I see it as an indoor theme park where the theme is to try to win money and have fun in a faux New Orleans. Big Al the Alligator is the mascot of this indoor theme park. He is to the Orlean's what Micky Mouse is to Disneyland.  At the main entrance he stars with the alligator statues playing jazz in a scene that welcomes guests to the Orlean's.  Last week was the fourth time this scene welcomed me as a guest in the Orlean's when I walked in the casino during my staycation. And, I have a lot to say.

 The Orleans is the best of both worlds. It is a Boyd local's casino and a Strip corridor tourist casino. It is off of Tropicana Avenue about a mile west of the Las Vegas Strip. Depending on traffic, around every half hour, the Boyd shuttle runs between the Orlean's & Bally's from 9 am to 12:30 am. Guests & B-card members get priority. For the record they never checked. The parking garage is easy in easy out where the surface parking is hit & miss.

  If you read my reviews, you know I love eating. The Orlean's has good dining options. Their French Market Buffet is better than some of the hyper-priced Strip buffets. The 24-hour Courtyard Cafe serves good food at reasonable prices. Near the parking garage is the food court featuring Fuddruckers, Sbarro, Subway, & Baskin Robins. Near registration, Java Coffee is a nice spot to relax with a Starbuck's coffee and Krispy Kreme Donut. And there is Friday's, Sushi, steak house, and an oyster bar.

  If you read my reviews, you know I like drinking & having a good time. This is a casino with cool bars. There is Brendan's Irish Pub. I prefer this bar when it is quiet. And they made a good Blue Hawaiin that was around $7.  In the heart of the casino there are New Orlean's themed bars with serious attention to the motif. They are the Alligator Bar, Crawfish Bar, & Mardi Gras Bars. The drafts beer at the casino bars start at $3.50 for Budweiser. Near the main entrance is the Bourbon Lounge. At night it is a nice spot to take in a live covers band. One night a country act played here. This past Saturday, a covers act played soft music featuring Barry White's "Love Theme."

 Reading my reviews, you see I like entertainment.  The Orlean's has a bowling alley, movie theaters, a decent resort pool, and an arena. The arena is the home of the Las Vegas Wrangler's ice hocky. And there is a plush showroom that I remember being comfortable many moons ago when we saw the Pointer Sisters.

  All this stuff costs money. With that said, I enjoy moderate gambling with the hopes of winning some money. My game of choice is Caveman Keno. The Orlean's is a go-to casino for Keno players. There is a Keno lounge surrounded by Game Maker keno machines. This past Saturday I gambled near the Bourbon Lounge overhearing the music of Barry White and soft rock. $5 kept me in action for an hour. In that hour, the cocktail waitress delivered two Blue Hawaiins & a Coke.

  The Orlean's is a relatively safe place to stay. There is a security guard by the elevators. All we did was flash our room card to get on the elevator.  So in reality a bad guy could blend in with a crowd holding an old room card. Security is a good deterent and they also have a presence throughout the casino & parking garage.

  Room 1248 wasn't a Bellagio suite, however,  it was comfortable. I slept very well on the soft bed. Room 1248 overlooked the resort pool. This brings up the point that most rooms most likely have a nice view. The west facing rooms in the t-shaped tower overlook Red Rock Canyon and the east facing rooms overlook the Strip. Maid service was on the ball. And compared to the Strip hotels, the rates are a steal. I have seen close to a $100 price difference between the Orlean's and Strip properties.

  I am a fan of the theme casinos. The casinos that overdo it with stuffness are blah. The hotel casinos that do a fantastic job with the theme are unique and fun. The Orlean's is a theme hotel casino that is fun to the degree that I themed its review after an indoor theme park. I am a fan of indoor theme parks and will most likely return to the hotel casino where the Big Easy meets Viva Las Vegas.

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

If it weren't for the ice-cold A/C, this place would definitely get 5 stars!
I just got home from dinner with my brother-in-law, who's in town for a conference.  He said "pick a nice place" and, of course, I chose Durant's!
Valet parking.  Cute as a button, and I gave him the "I wanna put you in my pocket" line.  
See, my sister and her family live in the OC.  Not much for flavor there.  When we walked in through the kitchen, the first thing the bro-in-law said was "Awesome!  Just like old Queens mobsters, walking in through the kitchen!"
We were early for our reservation, but it didn't look like we needed it for a Monday night (come on, it's football season!) so we were promptly seated.
Decor reminds me of my Hungarian/Polish grandparent's house.  Red velvet wallpaper and dark red leather booths.  Really plush and the booths could sit 4 comfortably.  There were some hotties in there, so I made sure to sit across from the bro-in-law!  
One of the thing you KNOW means class is them giving out BLACK linen napkins if you're wearing black.  Nothing ruins a good night out more than white lint on your lap.
The bread came and it was doused in an olive oil-basil-onion concoction.  I only had a little piece, but it was awesome!  It was already pre-cut, too.  Convenient!
The BIL (keep up, that's brother-in-law and I'm gonna type it a bunch of times and that's just ridiculous) had to order the fried calamari, his staple.  Breading was light, but a bit too salty.
The soup special was an onion-cheese and really rich and creamy.  I had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  BIL got the scallops, which had pieces of bacon around the edges.  Both dishes were perfect.  My steak was done just right - medium rare.  
We shared dessert.  Strawberry shortcake.  For 2.  We couldn't even finish it.  Topped with homemade whipped cream.
The best touch, though, was the ambience.  Oh, and members of "the Family" at the table right next to us.  Ah, to hear that Queens accent again!  
Definitely my top high-end restaurant in the Valley now!  I'll be back!  Not with the BIL, though.  I'll bring one of my boys.

I've had my hair done by the infamous Kim Vo & I don't consider myself fortunate. You couldn't pay me to go back to him. I gave him two chances but he lost me as a client! Not that he cares because Kim is some "big shot" hairdresser (allegedly). But please allow me to explain because YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT GO HERE!

I thought Kim was a nice guy, so it sucks to have to write this, but this is about hair here & I make my money partially based upon how I look. The results of his work has messed with my livelihood & I'm not happy about it! In short, Kim majorly screwed my hair up & this isn't some isolated incident. I'm completely baffled as to why Kim is a so called "celebrity hairdresser" yet THIS doesn't seem to be common knowledge:

"Kim Vo Firestarter" it's appropriately titled... http://gomezhyatt.com/2010-03-22-kim-vo-firestarter/

I wish I'd read all this BEFORE I went to him because if I had, I would have never let him come within 50 ft of my hair! The whole reason why I went to him was his BS marketing about how he's the "best blonder in the business" & how his blonde techniques are actually healthy for your hair. And I'm embarrassed to say that he caught me with his marketing hook, line and sinker. His PR company must be GOOD at burying info because it turns out that Kim is actually also famous for allegedly burning people & frying people's hair off. You can google all of this info yourself or you will hear it from time to time on Chelsea Lately, as apparently he fried her hair hair off too. Luckily I wasn't burned but I had to cut ties because Kim Vo left my hair in the worst shape that it has ever been in my life after only two visits with him. 

Kim does a GREAT job alright... at packing on the clients like an assembly line! The first time I saw him I was amazed at how fast he works. I was happy with my color but I did notice some tiger striping which was also pointed out to me every time I had a blowout. I think "Who did you hair?!" were the exact words my stylist said when she looked at all the bleeding from the foils in the back section that I was unable to see. But stupid me ignored these warning signs & I somehow thought perhaps it was my fault & that maybe I had tapped the foils by accident while under the dryer. And Kim had me roped in with his lil used car salespitch about how I have to give him a good four visits for my hair to be where it should be. So back I went for time #2 at his salon in Vegas at The Palms. I had been noticing that my hair was sticking up straight every morning like I had been sticking my finger in a light socket so I said something to Kim about it thinking that maybe I should cut my hair even shorter because it was obviously still damaged. Kim talked me out of it though. He related a story about how he was having the same issues with his own hair that morning & that it was sticking up because our hair was short & that we didn't have the weight of it being long to weigh it down. His explanation quieted my concerns & I entrusted him with my hair again. After this visit, my hair condition got even worse & then it finally hit me that HE was the one who was messing my hair up! That's when I started reflecting, & think about it, if he can't even get his own hair right, that is NOT a good sign! And the other thing is that I've had short hair before & I never had issues with my hair sticking up straight like it did under his care. So yeah, the length of my hair was not the problem. It was Kim Vo that was the problem. And let me just say, he is FIRED & officially off my Xmas card list! He's actually lucky I'm not waiting for him in a dark alley to show him my wrestling moves & brass knuckle phone case demonstration, LOL!

And now that I'm done with him, it's crazy how many horror stories I've heard about Mr. Vo which lead me to the articles/shows talking about how he (allegedly) burns people & fries hair. And I also heard that he uses some really hardcore bleach on everyone's hair because when he does his little assembly line action it allows him to lift the hair quicker which means mo clients + mo money = win for him. So if these things are true, then to Kim, you are really nothing more than a dollar sign & that pisses me off. The guy doesn't give a flying F#$K about your hair's health & I had to get back on the extension train & spend a lot of $$ to fix what he did. I just wish someone had said something on Yelp &/or this info wasn't buried by PR campaigns because I definitely would have thought twice about going to him. I'm pissed I drove all the way to Beverly Hills to see him the first time & paid a fortune x2, only to have my hair ruined! So that's my story. Maybe you won't have to fry your hair off or ruin it like he's done to me & others (allegedly). It's really a shame because I wanted to like Kim! I just got sucked in to all the hype. If I can save one person from my fate, this review will have been worth it.

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

$20/hr foot massage.  Need I say more?

Anyone who knows me knows I love a good foot rub!  And finally, Las Vegas has seen the light and is offering $20/hr foot massages!  Yes, you heard that right - $20/hr foot massages!  (What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)

Bali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.

Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)

Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.

Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.

Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)  I will definitely be going back there again though because we bought the gift cards!

Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.

They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.

For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.

Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck. 

Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike. 

The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats. 

The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup. 

For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.

Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed. 

However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.

Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!

People love to rag on Desert Sky Mall, like it's an American Idol contestant or a homeless person. Like your criticism is essential to its existence.

"It's too small. They have nothing good. It's so cheap and dirty. It's a shit mall. You're better off going to Arizona Mills or Arrowhead."

Like the people who drive all the way out to Westgate and still manage to muster the inanity to complain of how it isn't Scottsdale, these same jibbajabberers clearly have no grasp on the area and its economic status. They don't live here (surprise), and make a point to mention EVERY TIME they visit the west side how much they hate it.

Yeah, fuck you too.

Sure, Desert Sky is ghetto. Because IT'S IN the ghetto.

There's a reason so many people take the bus to this mall. It's not because they're environmentally aware. 

To better illustrate the socio-economic climate of Desert Sky, I have prepared a neatly compiled bullet-point presentation. 

* At any given moment, one or more stores in DSM is going out of business. Some don't even make it over the 6 month hump. So if you see something in that smoke shop you really like, better get while you're there, because next year it'll be a perfumery. 

* They can't even afford decent food court food. Other malls have Orange Julius and Hot Dog on a Stick. They get Flaming Wok (who carries the exact same menu as Panda Express but still manages to somehow be less authentic) and a Subway counter staffed by seemingly invisible sandwich artists. 

* And you thought the "free samples" guy at your mall was annoying. DSM has the most aggressive kiosk workers in all of mall-hood. Their cell phone plan is such an affordable value that they're willing to barrel through other patrons and ambush you behind signs and walls to let you know how awesome their deals are. Sure, you didn't want that sugar-coated nut, but at least nobody was injured in the process. Except maybe the underpaid workers whose nut-harvesting skills were exploited by their cheapskate employer. 

* It's pretty common knowledge that one of the department stores (hint; shares it's name with an island and a type of blue-colored liqueur) will issue you a store credit card on the spot. No application process. No waiting period. No wonder everyone comes here packing heat. All these people in holey shirts and torn up jeans walking out of stores with brand new stereos and speakers, their faces shifty with looks of guilt and/or disbelief. 

* The "special attractions" here blow. Business is so bad the caricaturist is closed on weekends. ON WEEKENDS. I went to the mall yesterday and the Santa they brought in had ONE kid waiting in line to get their picture taken. One. People can't even afford to TELL Santa what they want for Christmas. Woe upon the world.

* The Steve and Barry's here is closing down. How FUBAR'd is the economy when not even the combined endorsements of Amanda Byrnes, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the WWE can sell your 9 dollar jeans?

* I have on more than one occasion been asked by fellow patrons not to eat my Pretzel Time in front of their kids, or they'll be forced to explain to them why they can't afford such snacks. I would have given them my pretzel, but being originally from Philadelphia I douse mine in yellow mustard, and 99 percent of the people I've come across find it repulsive.

* Did I mention that this is one of the only malls (if not the only) in the whole state that can only afford to have ONE story?

So please, before you pass judgment on this calamitous and downtrodden mall, please take into consideration the geography and economy of the area and its consequences on neighboring businesses.

Translation: STFU, n00b.

Once in a while, miracles happen to me. It's often while I'm traveling, which is probably because (a) you're in a more desperate, survivalist state when you don't have your bearings and therefore unexpected discoveries seem more miraculous, and (b) when I travel I visit almost exclusively the historic downtown core of any place, which is usually where everything magical resides. 

Now, I may be the only person in the world who travels to Las Vegas to visit the historic downtown core, but this is who I am and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it. Also, fuck the Strip. It's the same shitty middleamerican crowd, it's just more expensive and larger scale, which are shitty middleamerican things anyway.

Back to the historic downtown core thing, they appear to be doing some civic redevelopment stuff in the "East Fremont Street" area. So when LB and I were traipsing around in the 105 degree heat admiring historic neon signs and abandoned wedding chapels, and we noticed a big sign across from the El Cortez for "MEX/CUBAN FOOD", I knew immediately that a travel miracle was upon us. And it was. 

First of all, it is the cutest fucking place you have ever seen. From the neon signage to the bright pink and gold chairs and pleather booths to the waitresses' dresses, it makes you want to kill yourself for ever having eaten at a crappy Chevy's. It's the real deal. It also has a giant big screen TV upon which we witnessed the following: latin music videos on "htv" (hispanic tv? anyway, h-urbano was our favorite channel), music videos featuring booty shaking ladies and armadillos, and - this is for real - a DVD concert series of recent performances by KC & the Sunshine Band, Wild Cherry, and the Trammps. Now, if you know me, you know that disco music is the way to my heart. So Mamacita's, you had me at Play That Funky Music Whiteboy. But I'm not sure you had the large Mexican family eating at pushed-together tables, because they were not stoked when you turned off the Urbano. Also, I should add that the sound system is first rate, and I think at night it turns into a dance club. Sweet.

So, we also learned, "Mex/Cuban" does not mean a mishmosh of two cuisines. Apparently the owner (?) is Mexican, and her husband is Cuban, which means they have two distinct menus, one for each cuisine. Which results in more delicious choices for you, the customer. I would recommend ordering everything under "side orders" and a Cuban Sandwich. That's what I did. You may want to play it more on the healthy side and order the vegetarian fajitas, or the avocado salad. I know this because I ate those, too. Also, make sure to get the yuca. It comes two ways: fried, and in an oily roasted garlic sauce. I mean, you might as well get both of those, too. I'm not going to lie and say we didn't.  You can also get an entire roasted tilapia, if that's your thing. We actually didn't order that. 

Anyway, the point is that the food in Vegas is so generally shitty that when you're ready for a meal that doesn't involve processed lunch meat or $0.99 shrimp cocktail, Mamacita's is there for you, so be ready to EAT.

Also, the ladies serving you are pretty much the nicest people I've ever met, so if you are one of those assholes that is rude to cab drivers and waitstaff, please don't go in here because I will be forced to break knees.

The customer base is eclectic. A nice mix of latin families, oddly misplaced white people and the local street characters, of which there seem to be many on this part of East Fremont. On the walk back to the hotel I was asked if my ethnic heritage includes Russian by a dude smoking a doob in plain sight, and I'm pretty sure I saw Aileen Wuornos order a burrito. But something about it was way less scary than the nasty hooker trash at the Palms.

Once upon a time there were 3 bunnies... very hungry bunnies. Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat. It was seven hotels to be exact, actually, as they were on mission to complete...  *insert deep, booming voice* THE BUFFET OF BUFFETS!!!

And complete it they did! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ?select=cicuGUx9tyF5o88Ykc_0uA
I write today to tell the tale of the 3 bunnies' eating adventure on Easter weekend 2011.   

* SATURDAY *

Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo) - 12:50pm
- Officially got our wristband passes here + thus began the adventure. Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      

Lago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm
- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn't  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    

Le Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm
-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, crme brle, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  

The Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm
- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! 


* SUNDAY *

Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am
- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  

Flavors, The Buffet (Harrah's) - 11:30am
- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)

Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm
- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the "Asian noodles" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don't waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  

*****

Strategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). 

Priced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us 

   $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) 
+ $48 (1 extra BofB pass)
----------
   $261  

Split between 3 girls... that's DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn't a big deal.

And then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!

Outstanding Thai food on the East side and at the cheapest prices I've ever seen! Thank you to Yelper Shawn J's review for leading me to gold.

Normally I wait to write a review until after I have at least two dining experiences, but today I can't wait. Zero patience when it comes to spreading the good word about good food.

 5 STAR FLAVOR. $5.50 (Lunch Special Prices) Green Curry Chicken at 10 for heat level. Overall it was some of the best Green Curry I've encountered and the heat level was spot on. Nice balance of white meat chicken to vegetables and loaded with chiles. It's going to be hard for me to try anything else because it was that good.

 5 STAR SERVICE. The lady who helped me gets 5 stars just for her smile. She lit up the small restaurant with her smile and positive attitude.  Her spirit is contagious and I wish my coworkers could be more like her. I had a real funny thing I wrote right here about that, but thought it would be in my best interest to keep it to myself. (That's growth)

Why only 4 STARS you ask? 
1. Because I've only eaten here once and I am not going to high five a spot until I have tasted more of the menu.
2. This place is REALLY small. It was clean and bright, but it's just too small. Definitely not first date worthy unless the person is really cool and really loves Thai food and you. Then it would be ideal. 

I forgot to mention if you check in on Yelp you get a free Thai Tea if you are dining in. 

Thai Food To Go is not to be missed. One of the most flavorful, top quality meals around for 5 bucks. I might go back tomorrow to try the Pumpkin Curry on special right now!

I'm Mel C. and I approve this restaurant. 

Wow!  That's all I gots to say about Yonaka. So many great reviews here and it's not at all just hype. Yonaka delivers in all aspects from ambiance, location, service, presentation, and of course the food.  This has been bookmarked ever since I read Cathy L's review in January.  Also, the current Duke of Yonaka aka Arvin C and his beautiful wife C-Dub also recommended this place to us.  So it's set.  Me, Sugi, and T-Elite changed our original Friday night plans and headed here for dinner.  Best decision we made all week.  Yonaka is legit!!!

-Food:  I enjoyed every dish that I had and when it comes to freshness, Yonaka is the "Duke of Freshness".  Their fish is even delivered straight from Japan.  I had their Horse Mackerel Nigiri, Yellow Tail Nigiri, Yellow Tail Hamachi, Yellow Tail Shashimi, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, Asparagus w/rice crisp & spicy mustard, and their Spider Roll.  Come to think of it, this is a lot of food that I just ate for about $30.  Every dish is prepared and presented like a piece of art.  You have to check out the pictures to know exactly what I'm talking about. I don't think a review does the food any justice.  You just have to come by and check them out for yourself. 

-Service:  Woohoo! As good as it gets!  Jax and Tiffany were great.  Jax came to our table and explained everything to us, the history, about the food, etc.  Jax is such a darling.  How often do you go to a restaurant where the staff shakes your hand and introduces themselves to you?  Think about it for a second.  Here, they do exactly that. We even had two servers (Ashley and Mike) and they were both attentive.  One thing they do here at Yonaka is that they serve each of your dishes one at a time.  This means no crowded table full of empty plates and no food confusion.  I think they watch when you're about done with one of your dishes, then serve the next one.  Perfect timing here and I love it.  When we were done eating, Jax gave us her number so we can spread the word. I guess she knew we were all very satisfied. 

So many positives about this place.  Here's another one...it's close to the strip for you out of towners.  I think I could go broke eating here, but not because it's expensive. The prices are fair here.  I think I'd go broke because I could eat everything on this menu.  

PS:  Yonaka...Can't wait!!!

If at first you don't get in, try, try again! This is what I told myself after visiting the first time on a Saturday night only to learn that it was a three-hour wait for a bay (the private golf areas). The next time we tried to visit, we came at a down time and luckily scored a bay right away! I'm so excited to see a place like Top Golf come to the Valley. My only question is, what took them so long and why don't other fun entertainment spots like this open up more often!? 

Golfer or not, this is a really fun time and it's family-friendly so Mom & Dad can have a cocktail while the children play! It's like a driving range meets a bar meets a golf arcade. Now, if you are a golfer, you might never want to leave and if you aren't a golfer, this might kick start you into wanting to play. We had a lot of fun and can't wait to continue to visit, especially when the weather cools down!

Here's how it works. 

1. First time you visit, you will go to the check-in counter and buy a card for $5. This card will serve as your license to golf and that means you can bypass the first counter on your next visit. You will also pay for the first hour which varies in price depending on the time of day: $25 an hour (total, not per person) from open until Noon, $35 an hour from Noon-5 and $45 an hour from 5:00 until close. 

2. After you've signed up and purchase your card and first hour, they send you over to the concierge where they will set you up with your bay or put you on a wait-list depending on the time of day. 

3. Now that you're set up, you can head over to your bay and start to play. The bay comes with golf clubs and a private area with couches and misters so even if you don't want to play, you can still hang out and watch! 

4. The bays run by the hour, so when your hour is up, you can pay for another half hour or hour right at your bay, making it easy (and pricey!)

5. You will get your own server at your bay and they offer a full bar and full menu of tasty food.

*** If you just want to come and drink, they also have a full bar set-up so you don't have to rent a bay. ****


Tips:

1. If you're a golfer, you can bring your own clubs. 

2. If you like to play with a glove, bring it with you. 

3. Wear comfortable clothes. 

4. You don't need golf shoes but I suggest you wear closed toed shoes. I played in flip flops and it wasn't very fun. 

5. If you don't want to play golf, you can still hang out with your friends in the bay while they play.

I've been doing a lot of searches on Vegas lately because of the Yelp Spring Break Las Vegas that's coming up in 2 months!!  I CAN NOT WAIT!!!  I'm totally ready!!  I wanna go NNNNOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, that's how I got to thinking, I should review one of my fave places!!

I've been going to Vegas since I can remember.  We used to play at the arcades while the parentals would gamble away our college funds.  We would have annual summer treks out to the desert with a huge group of friends and family.  It was good times.  Circus Circus was the place to be!!

During the teenage years, Vegas was boring...  Nothing to do except eat or stay in the room.  I didn't go to Vegas for years...

Once I turned 21, I've been coming all the time!  At least twice a year.  I remember a time when I was here for 3 weekends out of 4!  That was just craziness.

I've been to Vegas for shows, weddings, bachelorette parties, birthday parties, girls weekends, just cuz trips, you name it!  There is so much to do, so much to celebrate!

I'm not a huge gambler or clubber, but I always find something entertaining to do.

Wanna relax and unwind?  There are spas at almost every hotel!  THEbathhouse (THEhotel) and Qua (Cesar's) are must dos!

Wanna people watch?  Anywhere you find a chair works!!  People from all over the globe come to Vegas.  It's awesome!  I especially like walking the Strip on nice days.

Wanna eat?  There are soooo many restaurants and food places, one can never eat them all!  I still have a list of my must eats. 

Wanna eat lots?  Have you heard of Buffet of Buffets?  Yelp it!  I love buffets, so much variety, not enough stomach space!  :(  I like to sometimes go to off-strip places.  There are so many awesome finds!  

Wanna shop?  There are stores everywhere!!  Some of my favorite shopping is at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North off Charleston.  & Coke World Rocks!

Wanna see cool canyons?  Red Rock Canyon is only about 20 minutes drive from the strip.  It's gorgeous!

Wanna sleep? There is no sleeping in VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, if you must...  There are so many hotels at so many price ranges.  But...  go BIG or GO HOME!!  :P

Wanna see cute boys strut their stuff?  There's lots of that goin' on here too!!  Chippendales or Thunder from Down Under are awesome!!  Or head over to Olympic Gardens ;) for up close action!

For girlie stuff:  head to pole dancing classes or spas or Chippendales!!!

Wanna dance the night away?  There are lots of clubs, too many to count...  I don't go anymore cuz it makes me feel old :(

Wanna soak up the sun?  Most hotels have some pretty awesome pools.  I love the one at Bellagio!  Just gorgeous!

Wanna gamble?  Of course you do!!  ITS VEGAS!!!  Most casinos are pretty cool.  I like the non-smoking ones.  Grab a chair & play!  My faves are Pai Gow Poker or Blackjack.  Wizard of Oz slots is cool too!

Wanna drink?  So many bars to hang out in!!  Hit up Voodoo Lounge, it has a great view!!!

Like free stuff?  Go to Bellagio for the fountains and my fave, the conservatory/gardens.  Tons of free stuff to do!  

Oh, Vegas, how I love thee....

It means more to me than anything to see a Japanese person succeed in America. It's very difficult to run a small business. The hardships you must endure to barely allow your business to just merely survive one more month are indescribable. I'm not going to make this a detailed argument about politics, but whenever a democrat is in office, small business(most particularly Asian owned business) will struggle. There is a misconception that if you own a business that you are "rich". In reality the owners of these establishments put their life savings on the line to buy these small stores. They cannot afford to hire workers, or pay workers comp insurance, etc. Everyone in the family works over 12 hours a day to barely allow the business to break even. As a 4th generation Asian-American, no one supports small business more than I do. I would prefer to shop here any day over mega Asian markets such as Greenland, 168, and Seafood City. 

Mini Mart Japan is a great resource here in LV. They have just about everything you need when it comes to making basic Japanese food at home. They have a great selection of Japanese candies, and candy from other Asian countries that are popular in Japan.  Also, they have DVDs of current television shows in Japan that are impossible to find online. I come here for that Special Instant Ramen that tastes almost like what you find at your favorite Ramen-Ya. Also, I like to stock up on Green Tea and Mochi Kit Kats!!

Japanese products have a very quick expiration date. For example, we can buy Kit Kats at any convenient store or Wal-Mart, but when you open the package the Kit Kat will taste hard, stale, and have that white chalky stuff all over it. A Kit Kat from Japan will never be like that. It will be moist, fresh, and full of flavor. It features no chemical preservatives, but may have a shorter self life. That's why you will have to pay extra, but to me it is far worth the extra dollar. 

I know that many of you FOB Asians and 2nd generation Asian-Americans don't understand my point of view when it comes to supporting other Asians in America. I read your Yelp reviews and see how you bash other Asian owned businesses and give harsh bullying reviews.  In the last decade, I've seen the Asian community in America become very disconnected and spiteful of each other. Everyone wants to be "white" now, and no one supports each other. Asian-Americans are indeed the highest economic earning group in America. No other race makes more money than us according to ALL studies. Do you know how we got to that place? Because a long time ago we used to support each other, and help each other succeed. So, let's keep it that way. Let's remain on top of the food chain here in America. Instead of condemning businesses like this for being "too small" and "not fancy",  lets band together again like old times. I encourage all Japanese-Americans in LV to support businesses like JAPAN MINI MART, and other small business in LV.

I was driving down Spring Mountain on my way home and decided to stop by Lee's for a quick milk tea, when I saw the sign for Fat Dumpling. I had never noticed this place pop up, so stopped in for a quick to go order. 

They have a small dining area, but they can fit a sizable amount of tables for dine in guests. All the servers were really friendly and I was greeted quickly and politely by two when I walked in. One server told me they had only been open two days, so I was pleasantly surprised by how big a crowd of diners they had attracted. 

Their menu is extensive. I noticed soup dumplings and got excited, but since I was doing takeout I knew that was a no-go. Next time for sure. I ended up with the pork and cabbage dumplings and a taro slush with boba. My dumplings came out first and were packaged well to go. I had hoped for some sauces or something, but I just used some stuff I had at home to dip them in. My taro slush wasn't amazing. It was a little on the thick side and too sweet. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a few flavors, so I'd be interested in trying some of their less conventional flavors. 

I tried some dumplings as soon as I got home and they were good. Lots of meat and pretty flavorful. Not the best I've ever had, but solid and a huge portion for the price. They're a new spot, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I look forward to trying a few more of their menu items in the future.

For our 9 year anniversary we decided to do a weekend getaway to Las Vegas.  Our last visit to Sin City was over 8 years ago and we knew a lot had changed since then.  If we were to head to Vegas we knew we wanted to do it right and have the steak dinner, the shows and the entire Vegas package.  Our last visit we stayed at the Venetian (which I loved) and although super nice it came with a price and we were unable to afford the amenities of the shows and everything else that Vegas has to offer.  After scouring the web and reading a ton of reviews we settled on the Monte Carlo for this trip.

The Monte Carlo is an older hotel but still carries itself with great luxury.  The hotel is still modern in its design and really does feel as upscale as many of the newer places in my opinion.  They have a number of restaurants on the premises and although most reviews I read said to stay away we found a great steakhouse and coffee shop that were fantastic.  Upon check-in we found that the room choice we had made were limited in availability and thus we ended up on the 7th floor which really hindered the view of the strip.  I was fine with this as we really weren't planning on spending much time in the room themselves although higher is definitely the way to go.  The room was spacious and nicely furnished, the water pressure was great in the shower (the tub unfortunately had a slow drain that wouldn't keep the water).  The one downfall to the room is the fact that the Monte Carlo only currently offers a wired internet connection in the rooms (our didn't work) and WiFi is only in the 1st two floors (casino and spa/pool areas).  It was unfortunately colder and quite windy during our visit so the Pool was never even an option on this visit.

Despite having a long line at check-in, the process was smooth and seamless and we got through it in just a few minutes.  The express checkout is nice and can be done in numerous way as well including through the TV, the kiosks downstairs, via text message, calling a automated number on your room phone or filling out a card and leaving it at the desk downstairs.  

The Monte Carlos also houses a number of stores throughout as well as being the current home of The Blue Man Group show.  The also house the Minus 5 Bar, Ignite Bar and upscale eateries such as Andre's and Brand Steakhouse.  They offer Valet parking in front or self parking in a structure to the rear between Frank Sinatra and Las Vegas Blvd (although it was a bit hard to find unless you know where it is.

For what we got and the time we spent here, I feel that the Monte Carlo was a great value and a definite good stay.  The casino I found a bit lacking overall compared to some of the other nearby hotels but being as I am not a big gambler this was not much of an issue.  I would definitely stay here again for future visits.

Rose Rabbit Lie is like no venue you've been to in Vegas. 

Yes... it is another venue on the strip that offers the typical "bottle service" but you can't come with preconceived notions based off of what you have experienced in Vegas. Rose Rabbit Lie is a club, a live theater, a restaurant, and a speakeasy ...AT THE SAME DAMN TIME.

Secret rooms... mysterious doors... roaming performers...great eats...and the best cocktails in town. 

RRL might sound like too much going on when you hear about it but everything will make sense once you experience it for yourself. The venue has ticketed shows playing at 8pm, 10pm and 12pm. After these shows are over walls will open up and the room turns into a dance club with a DJ. This is probably when you start drinking and taking down shots. 

I can't remember the last time that I was out past midnight just because I wanted to be. I arrived in time to make most of the last show and try some of their food menu. The show was entertaining but very strange, definitely memorable. I would go into details but I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. As for the food, I tried the rabbit fricassee, steak frites, and bone marrow. They were all pretty good but pricey for tapas, but that should be expected when dining in the Cosmo. 

I chose to not start drinking until after the show because I wanted to see the venue sober...( my tolerance is ridiculously bad). We luckily got a tour of the place and was able to see every room.
TIP: If you see a door and it doesn't look like a kitchen or staff service well, go through it. It probably leads to another room. 

My favorite room by far has to the speakeasy/study in the back which is small and intimate but lively. They have a couple shelves of old school classic records that you can pick through and play on their record player which is fun. My friends had a great time going through them, reminiscing the good old days when they were ...well my age.
There is an exit door into the casino from this room which makes leaving the maze stress-free. 

WARNING: Their drinks hit hard. 
Expect their signature cocktails to blow your mind. These drinks were delicious! Probably some of the best cocktails I've ever had. 
They serve their signature cocktails in martini glasses but most of their drinks are served in heavy spinning cups with a single large block of ice. Pretty neat and very fun especially when you're intoxicated...that or I'm just easily amused. 

I recommend everyone to come experience Rose.Rabbit.Lie. They definitely changed the game and brought something new and refreshing to the Vegas strip.

Parking tip: Park in the westside garage or valet.

This place is just a couple miles away from my house, so I have been watching it like a hawk! I came in with my boyfriend on grand opening day (today), which happened to be a Monday, the only day they're suppose to be closed. The place Was fully stocked with EVERYTHING. Macarons in every color of the rainbow, different flavored flans, cakes (whole and slices), eclairs, tarts, cookies, croissants, banquettes, etc. 

We came in for pastries, but my boyfriend ended up with a sandwich combo (iced tea, French onion soup, roast beef/pesto sandwich) for $9.95. I ordered a 12oz latte ($3) and a few macarons ($1.10ea) pistachio, pistachio/chocolate, and rose. 

The soup was very flavorful. I didn't expect it to taste that great, so I was pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was a pretty generous portion, considering the combo price. You get a whole croissant with loads of meat inside. I didn't try it since I'm not a big roast beef fan, but my bf killed it pretty fast, so I'm assuming it was good. 

The espresso was nicely made considering it came from an automatic machine and it went very well with my 3 delicious macarons. The guy accidentally gave me a ginger macaron instead of my rose macaron. Luckily I really like ginger, so it was a satisfying mistake, but I only took a bite before trading it for the rose macaron! All the macarons were very fresh with a light, crisp outer layer and soft center. They all tasted exactly like you would imagine the flavor to taste. When I had a bite of the ginger, I felt like I ate a piece of the actual root! And when I ate the rose macaron, I imagined smelling a bouquet of roses. 

Overall, this place is amazing. I usually expect a few kinks when going to a brand new place, but all the food and pastries we had were amazing. This would've been a 5 star review, but I felt like the customer service wasn't equally distributed. We were sitting just two tables away from a couple that the cashier/server constantly kept checking up on and conversing with without checking up on us a single time, even after I had to exchange the macaron he mistakenly gave me. He even gave the couple some complimentary pastries (not exactly sure what they were) to try. I just feel that he should've at least checked up on us or talked to us if he was going to constantly give them special treatment.

Fast forward due to yelps word limit. 

The table that came nearly 15 minutes after is has received their meal. I know my timing is accurate as I have been watching my clock on my phone the entire time. We were trying to be out of there by 3:15 so that we could make the Roos n More zoo benefit at Zappos. It was already 3:15. We arrived at 2pm. We have not received our entrees yet.

The hostess, who is also running food, walks by and we ask her is she has an idea of how much longer we need to wait for our food. Her demeanor changes. Condescendingly, she tells us "they serve quality food here and it takes time". I have dined at Joel Robuchon on more than one occasion. That restaurant has three Michelin stars, and their food does not take anywhere near this long to prepare. How could french toast, a grilled cheese and a fish sandwich be expected to take this long? I'm pescetarian. I cook fish every day. Even if it is being prepared via sous-vide, it should take no longer than 30 minutes. Bewildered, I repeat that we have waited nearly 50 minutes. The hostess raises her eyebrows puts her index finger to her lips and "shush's" us. She actually hisses and then angrily reminds us that we are seated next to their "investors" and tells us to say things quietly so that their precious "investors" don't hear.

My girlfriend did not respond very well to that. Loudly, she tells the hostess that she will not be quiet and that the investors they are so worried about should probably hear what we are talking about. With a panicked look on her face, the girl threateningly replies "You want me to go and get the manager?Because I will go and get George!" Without waiting for a response, she does, in fact, get George. In retrospect, I respect her for subtly warning us what we were in for.

Clearly displeased to have his feeding session interrupted. The manager finishes enjoying a few fries from his plate before coming by. He lumbers over, still masticating, crumbs spewing from his lips as he attempts to swallow the large quantity of deep fried potatoes visibly struggling to find their way down his esophagus. Uninvited, he takes a seat opposite us. The fish and french toast arrive. The grilled cheese is nowhere in sight. 

"So, what's going on?" 
We told him our food arrived after waiting nearly 50 minutes. He told us that it's our fault because we ordered the fish. And fish takes a very long time to cook. Incredulously, I informed him that fish is the quickest cooking of every animal protein source. I asked him if he ever cooked before. 

Then he proudly, and very defensively informed us that he "owns this place". Next, this rather large man points at my 100 pound girlfriend and instructs her to "just sit down and enjoy the meal. It's the best fish you're ever going to have in your life." 

The grilled cheese arrives. 

My girlfriend did not appreciate being bossed around and dismissed as though her complaint had no merit. In fact, I believe this is the turning point in which we both became visibly enraged. I was confused, my entire body was shaking with rage, and I was fighting back tears.She told the manager that he had no right to tell her what to do, and that she would not just sit down and enjoy the meal. The manger responded "So leave then!" My girlfriend responded with a resounding "Oh, we will." 

Horrified, the entire restaurant, precious "investors" included, stared at us, jaws slack, eyes filled with pity. Realizing an opportunity to twist the situation and make us the bad guy, he demanded we pay for the meal we did not even stick a fork into and insinuated that we were creating a scene in order to get something for free. My girlfriend happily agreed to pay, and directly called him out on accusing us of not having the money to pay the bill. He then barked at the bartender to come and process her debit card. While waiting for the card to go through, my girlfriend turned to the horrified "investors" and apologized for disturbing their meal by making a scene.She mentioned that they should reconsider investing in a business that is owned by someone so classless and unprofessional. One woman, with empathy in her eyes said it was okay, and they all looked like they felt for us. Interrupting her apology, the manager insisted that they are not investors. My girlfriend insisted that every person on their staff said they were investors and thats why we had to sit at the lounge tables instead of a real table for lunch. Failing to find anything rational to say, the manager/owner then demanded to know where I work so that he could come in and complain at my job, like we did at his. He proceeded to yell at us and tell us we are a "bunch of a**holes" amongst other unnecessarily profane things for creating a scene. As we were walking out, he yelled at us to never come back. 
I told him to go f*** himself. 

This happened because we asked why our food was taking so long.

We asked. Asked NICELY. And we're met with this response

While waiting on a phone order of sweet potato fries from Gallagher's yesterday, I discovered a restaurant on the other end of the block sporting a "Grand Opening" banner (where Moe's Southwest Grill used to be).  Yay!  Another venue offering soul food with candied yams on the menu!!  Since none of the employees could answer my food allergy concerns that afternoon, I'd have to call the next morning.

Earlier today I was able to get my food issues cleared and decided I'd have a late lunch (or early dinner) of BBQ platter with three meats (choice of beef brisket, chicken on the bone, pulled pork, or rib tips).  I ordered the meats dry since the BBQ had allergens.  Dinners come with two sides and cornbread, so I chose candied yams and brown sugar baked beans and asked that the cornbread be packaged to go.

(Before I placed my order, I asked if I could sample the meat since the last time I tried BBQ meats on the dry side, I found them quite tasteless; the cook was more than happy to hand me a sample of the brisket.)

Liked the brisket; the meat was so tender and moist and  tasted like a smoky version of corned beef.  The chicken was good, too, but the meat was still red and slightly raw when I sliced into it for a peek underneath.  I showed it to the server who started to say that the chicken is usually served that way, but she took it back for more time in the oven when I asked.  Unfortunately, the chicken was very charred when it was returned to me.  I was able to salvage most of it after scraping the burnt skin off.  While the first two meats were delicious on their own, w/o BBQ sauce, the rib tips did not fare so well.  I liked the texture of the meat, but it definitely could use more complexity. 

While I was able to determine that the dessert menu (outside source so info on ingredients wasn't easily available) is pretty much off-limits to me, I am not in the least disheartened...  The candied yams and brown sugar baked beans (both made from in-house recipes) were so delectable and sweet, they're almost like dessert, but with added benefits- vitamins, fiber, and protein!  Mmm... LOVED the spices used to flavor the yams.  Yes, there are the usual suspects of butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar, but I detect something else... almond extract!  Go and have a try yourself and see if you can help me detect what these flavors are :)  And the baked beans!  Red peppers and hatch green chilies really make this side dish sing!  

Beans, beans, the musical fruit...  

Breakfast menu is served all day [steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy (thickened w/ cornstarch), scrambles, and country burritos, to name a few], and lunch and dinner menus [fried chicken and (Belgian) waffles, burgers, wings, BBQ tacos and wraps, sandwiches and po'boys, chicken fried steaks, etc.] start at 11a.  I'm already looking forward to taking my grandmother and cousin here on my next weekend off!

Notes to owners/manager:  

1.This easily could've been a four-star review, but I thought it poor form to send back a badly-charred chicken.  I didn't think it was wrong of me to send back the bloody leg... (Ring!!  "Hello, Salmonella poisoning, How may I hurt you?") 

2. I was told that the addition of sweet potato fries is being considered- please don't take too long to decide Yes! :D 
(With a good dusting of cinnamon-sugar, please!)

3. Please change your font printing on the front and back take-home menu covers.  The current choice (white print on black and superimposed on a white background) is almost illegible.

4. Kudos on having DEDICATED fryers for your fried fish (batter contains corn), chicken, and other meats (fried pork chops and chicken fried steaks)!!  Not only do dedicated fryers limit the flavor transfers of these varied meats, but they also benefit your patrons that may have food allergies (fish, spices, and other ingredients).

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

There's a new burger boss in town - Hooligans is the epitome of the gourmet bar burger! I hear a lot of talk about the strip having some of the best burgers in Vegas, but if you're a local, I would highly recommend that you give this new place a try! 

Insider: Bruce was the former Chef (genius mastermind) of Braddah's Island Style and he stole our hearts with his unique and crazy flavorful sauces. Being that we are sauce junkies, we followed him here (plus his crack sauces are here...) Well, the guy can also cook! He is now the executive chef here at Hooligans, so his menu screams flavor and his unique go big or go home philosophy.

Let's be real, my boyfriend and I came here to eat! We ordered "The Big Mass Burger"($11) - This burger is a beast! It's the biggest and most epic burger I've ever eaten in my life. Ok, imagine this: a massive 2/3 pound burger, glistening in all of it's glory, stuffed with 6 slices of melty gooey-ooey cheddar cheese and 6 slices bacon, finished off with more bacon, melty cheddar cheese oozing all over the place, sauted onions and mushrooms, and...wait for it, in a white wine garlic butter. (!!!) whoa there fancy pants. My mouth just trembled. It's a burger's dream of a burger.

First bite: I made a peck in it (that's how huge it was) and with that tiny peck, I got angry at how good it was! It's the type of delicious where you'd want to curse. Super juicy, seasoned expertly, and did I say juicy? Crazy juicy!!! All of the ingredients danced and sang together. The meat was seasoned like a pro, the grilled mushrooms and onions were super sweet and caramelized, the bun was grilled to perfection and soaked up all of the buttery meaty bacon-y flavor! It was madness. The burger is a masterpiece.

It's simple, Bruce cooks with so much passion and uses high quality ingredients. You don't taste frozen or dried out food here, it's all fresh! He also gets his beef shipped to him from Australia. Hey, we can definitely appreciate a guy that firmly knows what he wants. Also, bartender Dave was great! He was one-man-show'n it that night, but he was efficient and very friendly. He really offered us top notch service.

Other important details:
- Happy Hour 3pm-6pm and 12am-2am: Awesome deals! Half off the $6 food menu and $2.25 well drinks!
- Margarita Drenched Chicken Fajita Quesadillas with Brucie made pico and sour cream ($8) - I strongly urge you to add a side of Bruce's signature sauces (my personal favorite is the guava habanero), try them all and decide what's your winning combo. Now, dunk the juicy and flavorful quesadilla into the sauce and enter food ecstasy!
- Jalapeo Fries ($6) - (they are not potato fries) Super crispy and airy, light tempura battered jalapeo halves, lightly seasoned with cumin and served with Bruce's special cilantro ranch. It's not spicy, but kind of sweet and addicting. Bruce knocked that cilantro ranch out of the park! I'm a ranch snob and this is a grand prize winner. So rich and creamy! 
- Inferno (habanero) poppers ($6) - Great bold flavor...but, be careful, they are deathly spicy! We are avid spice eaters and eat raw thai bird chili peppers on the daily, but these are in a league of insanity. Let this be your warning: Use extreme caution when eating them.
- All of Bruce's famous crack sauces are also available on the menu to enjoy with your burger/ meal for $1 a pop. Try one, (try them all): raspberry sauce, pineapple lime, guava habanero, white noise ghost chili, coconut colada pearl. (pro tip: I love dipping my burgers and fries in all of them, but my personal favorite is the guava habanero)
- Pyrat Candy ($6) - salty pretzel, caramel, chocolate bark..Need I say more? Very naughty.
- If you're watching your waist line and burger intake, they also have lighter fare like grilled chicken, salad and sandwiches - if that's what you're looking for... at a bar. But yeeeeaaah, about that, just go all in and try his carnival creations, they are delicious! 

From one food fanatic to another, this place is a keeper. The entire Hooligans crew cared about our satisfaction and we left feeling 100% taken care of. Come try them out, you won't be disappointed. 

P.S. I'm planning and creating a UYE for Hooligans in the near future! Special yelp menu to be announced! Awesome burgers, refreshments, company, conversation, shenanigans. Let me know if you want in! :D~~

This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their "over the rainbow salad" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the "Spencer Steak" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  

Say hi to the pig heads outside!!

Ok so you if you dont know i'm biased toward Wing King because i believe excellence should be rewarded and not ignored. The NEW Campus Commons is possibly THE best kept secret in the general area due to it's impressive gathering of several individual eateries with their own unique flavors as well as a community vibe. 

Yes i know Brian the owner. The other guy behind the counter is Brandon his brother that holds down the shop when Brian is out doing other stuff. I've eaten here a few times and i've passed them up a few times and i'd like to share why i keep on coming back.

The Flavors
Now if you think there's 40 flavors as advertised you're wrong. The count i'd estimate now would be around 60 flavors with a lot more in the works. A unique thing about Brian is the gears inside his head are always turning and cranking out new flavors. The latest set of flavors (new during this re-review) all contain contain the word 'Slam' in them because he 'Slammed' them together that afternoon.
So far my all time favorite flavor are any of the Jamacian Jerk flavors. Standard is quite balanced with a layer upon layer of different flavors starting from some sweetness then some tangy savory, then herbal, then aromatics, and finally a steady rising heat from spicy.  The Apple Jerk is a bit sweeter but the latest being the Jamacian Slam is my new favorite with it's cinnamon notes

The Option to Taste and Pick What You Want
Lets say you're torn between a few flavors or want to give a taste of what new. Ask Brian or Brandon to try out the sauce. Time after time they've shown remarkable patience and a willingness to grab the sauce bottles and give you a taste as well as explain to you the origins of the sauce and it's various other similar flavors or new flavors that have emerged from that once sauce.

Tweek the Flavor
Lets say you choose a flavor but it's a bit spicier then you expected. This happens to me on a few occasions. I dont handle spicy all too well so i asked to cut the spicy by a third. They did it and it came out perfect. It's too spicy for you or not spicy enough? Ask them to crank it up or tweek it down. All sauces are made in house so they'd be more then willing to accommode you. 

The Fries
To be honest i love the regular fries. It's a mixture of the Seasoned dry rub flavor and a bit of the Cajun dry rub flavor but to me it's perfect for fries. Their fries dont come out of a plastic bag that's been frozen for a while. You are eating real washed skin on potatos and you can tell they are too, no two fries are the same and they all taste good. A new option is available to season your fries in different flavors as well. Garlic Parm is a huge hit among the masses as well as Sweet Chili. Be warned as these are better dine in then to go as the fries get soggy if you dont eat them fast enough.

There's Always Room for Dessert
Desserts are also all home made and made in house. The usual lineup of desserts include a Red Velvet cake, their Too Much Chocolate cake, chocolate cookies, and everyone's favorite: the Peach Cobbler. If you're lucky there will be something different. I struck gold on two occasions when there was a soaked Rum cake available one day and a few weeks later a German Chocolate cake with the coconut cream center.

Bottom line. If you're hungry and in the mood for a whole lot of flavors that wont leave you broke till next week. Wing King is the place to check out. If you're on a diet and dont think you should be eating wings or desserts, come anyway. Pretty sure Brian can season a basket of celery sticks for ya.

I finally sat at to the sushi bar!  I now know I never want a job cracking open oysters; that guy should get a bonus!  Also, Roka Akor knows how to make some beautiful dishes!  

 I should start off by saying Roka Akor has great food, BUT I am starting to come to the conclusion that I just need to come to Roka Akor for happy hour or the dinner entrees, not the sushi.  Their rolls (we had the Serrano Chili and Spicy Tuna) were honestly not that exciting and on the small side, but they tasted good and were solidly made.  I wish I had gone with my instincts and tried the Dynamite Scallop Roll, because we saw one being made later at the bar and it looked yummy.  The warm Wagyu roll sounded interesting to try next time too.  

I ALWAYS get the BUTTERFISH TATAKI; it is seriously amazing.  But, I should also say you get 5 small pieces of fish for $11, and it would never fill you up.  The octopus salad was delicious but came on a plate the size of a tea saucer with more greens than octopus (maybe 5 pieces of octopus); most octopus salad I have had, the majority of it is octopus.  As Jared R. said the Waygu Kimchi dumplings were not as exciting as all the other things we ate.  I think you just come to expect that WOW factor at Roka Akor and they don't deliver that.  

I checked in on Yelp and they offered the Yuzu Mousse dessert with a beverage purchase, which was a pleasant surprise!  The mousse was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon; definitely not rich and over-baring.  It came with a raspberry drizzle that complemented it beautifully.  

Not to be cliche, but one thing that was kind of noticeable to my date and I, was out of the 8 people in the open kitchen, one was Japanese.  

As for our service this time it was okay.  The guy I went with had never been to Roka Akor and had quite a few questions because they have a unique menu that lacks descriptions, which is fine when you have a knowledgeable waiter- but we didn't. I almost wonder if our waiter was relatively new, because he did not describe things very well and most things were described with adjectives like 'good' or 'great' and he basically just said 'I think I would go with that.'  It really didn't give you much to go on, especially since the menu does not have descriptions.  But, he got the job done and he was fast and pleasant, so I am not really complaining.  

What to take home with you: Roka Akor has beautiful, yummy food.  The prices are high and I think you can get just as good, if not better, sushi other places. ORDER THE BUTTERFISH TATAKI. They also have one of the greatest happy hours in town, with outstanding, reasonable food options!

I used to make jokes about how I'd someday like to open a yoga studio called Extreme Yoga (everything had its turn being marketed to us as "Extreme" for a while there in the early 90s didn't it?)
There would be intense, muscle-building poses (this was before i'd heard of the genius of joe pilates), a drill-instructor-like leader barking orders for the next pose "I SAID RELAAAAX, MAGGOTS!!!, and criticizing you for being a weak little mealy-mouthed wuss if you couldn't get or keep your balance, etc.
Good times.

Well, someone practically stole my idea and opened Bikram Yoga studios all over the place!  Just kidding, but not really.

The process of signing in as a first timer was so painlessly simply I thought sure I was skipping something, but nope.  Even as a Groupon customer, there was only a slight upsell mention of how purchasing an additional block of time during the first week would mean a better price than getting it afterwards.  

The price of 'renting' a towel must be designed to be purposely prohibitive so that they can avoid too much volume with their commercial towel cleaning service, because I don't think $2 is a very fair price at all for what you're getting (NOT getting, just borrowing), and they'd much rather have everyone bring their own towel.  Nice that it's available though.

The facility is clean and seems spacious from the lobby, but the limited square footage of the studio room itself filled up very quickly with bodies.
A shower/restroom/not-lockers-but-cubby-holes room is decent, and apparently kept stocked with soap/shampoo by volunteer donations.

Two instructors on different days gave a similar, but varied class.  Each having a slightly different style, both being competent and thorough in their directions -- I just felt that I could do without hearing about chakras and such related subject matter (i know it's part of the territory, but i think the lack of focus on the spiritual side is why i like joe pilates so much)

The class itself it pretty butt-kicking.  The advice to sit, but at least stay in the room, is good for when you feel the need to rest.  A newbie surely will need to sit for some of the standing balancing poses.  
I did, but in only two classes, I showed a marked improvement in that i only sat down twice the second class -- meaning a 3x improvement over the virgin visit!  

MORE NEWBIE ADVICE:
~drink a lot of water beforehand, and do not eat too much greasy food - you will sweat it out and it will give an odor like french fries, believe me.

which brings us to:
~take a shower IMMEDIATELY prior to class, or as close as possible, because you will sweat about 2.3 buckets, and as the wonderful instructor mentioned, the skin is an organ of elimination and this sweating is about releasing toxins, and toxins are stinky

~sniff your towel first, if you rent one - some of them, although clean, still have a lingering french fry odor permeating the cotton ( i wasn't the only one oozing grease, i guess)

~prepare to be sore.  this is a real workout, not some tai chi, ol' lady smooth flow stretch yoga crap.  put effort into a program like this and you won't need weight training.

I absolutely got a lot out of just these two visits, and plan to detox more during the next 3 weeks.
Considering the price of this place (outside of the groupon), I don't think the excessive charges for the towels or the BYOsoap is very appropriate.   That would have to be figured in when I decide if I want to continue with the membership after the initial period expires.

For now, I'll just keep stinking up my corner of the studio with french fry and chinese food sweat (beer, too!), and hope it doesn't disturb the folks on the neighboring mats all that much by harshing their mellow with fantasies of grease and carbs. 
8^ )
I love being healthy.

===================
Javier's is hit or miss at this location so that's why I gave four stars instead of five. I've been to them all practically, from Cabo, Mexico to Irvine to the one in the airport at John Wayne. Only Javier's I haven't been to is the one at Crystal Cove. 

For whatever reason, sometimes the food at the Aria location tastes consistent with my five star reviews of all their other locations, and sometimes it just tastes off. 

My first experience with this restaurant pissed me off and I almost didn't go back again. I ordered "enchiladas de mariscos" which is my favorite dish and what I order at all the other Javier's. I didn't think I even needed to look at the menu because I assumed it was the same as all the other locations, so I never bothered and just ordered away. I guess, in retrospect, I should have double-checked because the waiter brought me out chicken enchiladas instead of what I wanted. The second I tasted it I noticed something was not quite right but it was dark in there and I just assumed since this was a different Javier's and my first time, that maybe their cooks weren't up to speed out here in Vegas yet. The place was still somewhat new at the time. It didn't taste amazing like I was used to so I ate about half of one enchilada and then finally gave up, thinking another one bites the dust! I called the waiter over and told them that I was very disappointed with my dish (which I never do, for the record). I told him he must have brought me the wrong thing or the chef had no clue what was up and then he said, "No, I brought you what you ordered, enchiladas suizas." and I said, "No, I had ordered enchiladas de mariscos!" So yeah, obvious miscommunication there! That explained the mystery of why it didn't taste right. However, the waiter didn't offer to fix the situation and instead told me not to tip him. No clue what that was all about. Maybe the management takes it out of the waiters' tips if they get the orders wrong. I dunno... I've never had that happen before. Just thought that was the most interesting customer service I had ever received to date, if you even want to call that customer service. So needless to say, I left there unhappy that night. Thank god I complained because had I not, I would have written this place off as a no go. And waiter guy still got a tip even though I shoulda stiffed him! I'm too nice...

Anyway... Note to everyone who is used to calling it Enchiladas de Mariscos: It's actually called "Seafood Enchiladas" here and only here. Why my waiter, who spoke Spanish mind you, didn't get this right is beyond me but whatever! Mariscos translates to "seafood". What's the problemo, seor? Since the staff doesn't get it, they should be told that at the other locations this particular dish is called something different so technically it has two names. And they should be told what that name is so as to avoid other Javier's professionals, like me, from getting chicken enchiladas when they want seafood. And one more thing, if the waiters get it wrong, they should credit you back the price of your dish or remake your food for you the right way, at least. None of that don't tip me BS because that still doesn't make up for your mistake!

Anywhoooo... hate to admit it but these aholes at Javier's sure make good food (sometimes at this location, not 100% consistent) so that's why I keep coming back and not boycotting, in spite of my bad first impression with this Aria location. And it's not like I'm about to take a four hour drive to Cali just to satisfy my Javier's craving elsewhere. So I guess they have me stuck eating here, from time to time, when my cravings hit.

I absolutely love their organic margaritas (cadillac style). I guess after a few of those I'm willing to accept any of the crap that jerk Javier wishes to dish at me. I'm such a sucker! Their chips and salsa are addictive so be careful. Mustn't be too full for when your entre arrives! Another thing, the atmosphere here is a 10! I love that dark, Guernica style carving along the back wall. This is a great place to take a date. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Hear that boys? Just pray that they don't get her order wrong or if they do, that your date is laid back.

The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest "staid."  Perhaps even "stodgy," but that may be more harsh than I intend.

Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  

I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  

The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  

Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with "the best Caesar dressing ever" and "polenta croutons?!?" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  

We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  

Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  

As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.

Welcome to another secret garden of Old Town Scottsdale. Are you wondering where Cafe Monarch is located? Well, it's hidden in the most delightful way and I wouldn't want it to be any other way. But if you really want to find it (and I don't know if I want to give the secret away), I will say that it's located just south of Indian School off of Goldwater. 

When a restaurant has a five star average and nearly 60 reviews, they've got to be doing something right. Cafe Monarch is no exception. After months of anticipation, Cafe Monarch finally reopened its doors after a summer hiatus and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Through yelp reviews, I heard that you come prepared to eat what the chef feels like making that day. Yelp friends, don't question the chef. He knows what he's doing. He knows what you want more than you yourself know what you want. 

I began my meal with a freshly made hibiscus iced tea. It was the perfect refreshment to enjoy the warm weather on the adorable patio surrounding the restaurant. Since this is BYOB, the chef mentioned that this iced tea is also quite tasty with some vodka in it, but since I had a long day ahead of me, I went the alchi-free route this time. Possibly dinner next time? The menu had a variety of items to choose from including a chicken pesto sandwich or salad and a prosciutto panini. I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite (and remember, don't question the chef's choices) and I couldn't have been more pleased. The chicken was roasted to perfection and moist with freshly made cheesy pesto giving it a hug. Situated on a freshly made french baguette, it was a treat to put in my mouth and I secretly didn't want the cuisine experience to end! To accompany the sandwich, the chef made a salad full of fresh cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries. I assume he makes salads based on the season and I was very happy the fruit season was upon us! The meal was perfect. It was light and satisfying in a perfectly peaceful setting. The house is adorable and I wish my own could resemble it. 

I think this could quite possibly be one of the perfect locations to dine on a lazy afternoon when I don't have a care in the world (or want to pretend that I don't). And before I go, I wanted to mention how nice the chef/owner is! He's very personable with his customers and makes each experience unique and delightful. I believe that delightful is absolutely the overall word to describe my experience at Cafe Monarch. 

Some things to note before you visit:

- Cash only, so come prepared. I had an iced tea and sandwich with a salad and it was around $16. 

- BYOB and if you forget, there's a Circle K just next door to buy some "quality" booze 

- Be prepared to relax and enjoy yourself. For being a one man show, the chef/owner does an excellent job of preparing a delicacy in a short period of time, but the atmosphere is so adorable you should plan on staying to enjoy it while you're there.

This place was on my 'To Do List" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.

Before I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.

Since this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.

The restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.

After a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.

While I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.

Overall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!

Will I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!

It's been years since I've had hair on my head. So what am I doing inside a salon? Late on a Friday night, no less?

The answer involves three simple letters. BAO.

I've been wanting to check this place out for a while. I was in the area and found out via twitter that they were open late this Friday evening. (They've been staying open late on Friday nights for the past few weeks).

This cute little cafe is the epitome of random. Nestled within a pretty large salon, you will find Chef Sheridan Su and Jen Jen (it said that on her t-shirt) behind a small hole-in-the-wall counter. It's a very intimate setting and you get to watch them preparing your food. As such, I think I picked the perfect time to try this place for the first time. With no one else around, it felt like I was in their home and as they were fixing me a late night meal, we chatted back and forth getting to know one another.

With a couple as friendly and adorable as Sheridan and Jenny, I was immediately a fan of Great Bao, but how is their food?

I went with the ComBAO. This allows you to pick any three bao plus a drink for $10 (tax included). I opted for duck, pork, and chicken. The bread was so light and fluffy. I like theirs better than The Chairman truck. Each bao had something I liked and I fully enjoyed them all. But if I had to pick one, I'd probably go with duck. Honestly though, that's only ever-so-slightly ahead of pork, followed closely by chicken. According to Chef Su, I was the first to try a chicken wing version--the chicken bao is usually made with breast and thigh meat.

As for the drink, I went with a peach Italian soda with cream. It was surprisingly delicious. For some reason, it reminded me of a guava drink--very refreshing. After I was done with my three bao, Jenny asked me if I was ready for three more bao. What? I was so confused. Then she hands me a basket with three tiny balls of some sort of honey-biscuit-something-or-other. Funny and cute. Well played Jenny.

So a big thumbs up on the delicious food, the tasty beverage, the friendly service, the intimate atmosphere, and the quirky location inside a salon. Plus, I always love meeting awesome small business owners. Everything about Great Bao Asian Cafe is simply fantastic.

Now, I rarely ever write mediocre 3 Star reviews, but in my honest opinion, my tepid experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. With that said, here's the rundown of what transpired on the evening of July 4th... After reading rave reviews from friends and fellow Yelpers, i decided to choose Le Cirque to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The restaurant was bustling when we arrived. We were seated towards the back which was upsetting since I requested a window seat months in advance. A few tables were still vacant by the window, which I found puzzling. Moments later those same seats were filled with other patrons, same number of guests mind you, that came after us. Not a good start so far. 

Granted the place was busy, it's no excuse for the waiter to make us feel rushed. He seemed hurried and not warm yet he was quite efficient at taking our orders and whisking away in a flash.  He clumsily scattered our silverware on the table like we were dining at Denny's. Wait, even at Denny's our utensils are placed with more care than this jumbled mess.

We all went with the degustation menu at 135$ per person and the birthday boy went with the 88$ additional wine pairing, as well. With a bottle of French Pinot Gris on the table, we were good to go.

The breads weren't warm, but room temperature and very chewy. 
I went with the onion bacon and pretzel. The pretzel was salty and too tough to eat and the onion bacon was hard and practically indelible. 

Thankfully, our amuse bouche was a refreshing bite sized cucumber wrapped creme fraiche treat that awakened my palate perfectly. 

The first course was incredible.  It was a delicate langoustine osetra caviar carpaccio with crisp sliced green apples that simply made my taste buds pop at first bite. The contrasting textures and flavors went from tart to tangy to sweet and spectacular. A splendid first course.

Here's where it gets bad, again. The time period between the first and second course went from lengthy to uncomfortably long. Luckily I was in good company and we had pleasant conversation that helped pass the time but the extensive wait (30 minutes) was inexcusable.
We inquired with our server and he quickly rushed into the kitchen without responding to us. Moments later, our dishes came out from one of the support staff that appeared agitated and rushed, as well. What was going on here? There was plenty of staff standing around, yet the same few guys were running frantically around the small restaurant. Strange. 

The scallops were supple, buttery and exhibited an excellent mouthfeel.

The foie gras was magnificent. The combination with the sweet plump cherries was genius.

The fresh black truffle risotto was a huge disappointment, however. The risotto was undercooked and hard, which is not the consistency a good risotto should feel like. The only saving grace were the finely sliced black truffles sprinkled on top, that left a subtle yet heavenly aroma to this mediocre dish. At an additional 40$ supplement to the 135$ per person tasting menu, I expected better. I would have sent it back but refrained in fear of an even longer and more excruciating wait time.

The third courses were far more redeeming with the beautifully crusted cod that tasted like butter in my mouth and the sea bass that was simply heavenly
The John Dory was good but paled in comparison to the complex flavor profiles of the other two mind blowing dishes. 

The fourth dishes were fantastic, too. Namely the Kobe. It was literally melt in your mouth delicious. It came at an additional 65$ premium but it was well worth it. Divine in every way!

The duck was supple and the flesh was smooth and velvety soft. 

The rabbit was tasty but I couldn't help but feel it tasted like chicken.

The pre-dessert was bright and whimsical. A tequila lime sorbet with fresh grapefruit and poprocks was inventive, surprising, refreshing and a perfect palate cleanser

In regards to dessert, don't skip it. You would be making a huge mistake. With that said, you've gotta try the souffls here. They are perfect pillows of paradise in every bite. The chocolate was enticing but the vanilla grand marnier was irresistible! The ice sculpture berry sorbet dessert was inventive and incredibly refreshing, as well.

My friend received a birthday selection of mignardises and the ladies were presented with truffles neatly presented in Cartier inspired jewelry boxes. 

Thankfully the night ended on a positive note but in all honesty, for a restaurant of this caliber, I expected far more consistency in service than the inattentive and sloppy half-baked excuse for service we got last night. If it weren't for some of the incredibly amazing dishes, I would have given this place one star for the poor service alone.

If I were you, check out Picasso in the same hotel. They offer beautiful views, delicious five star quality dining coupled with exceptional service.

Happy Eats!

The greatest thing I love of the metro Phoenix area is hunting that is required to find a good place to eat in the sea of strip-malls.  I shop at the Fry's grocery store in this strip-mall and have always drove by.  A few months ago I stopped in this strip-mall to checkout a Mexican Food joint that went out of business.  I walked over a few spots and looked into the window of this place and found my eyes locked with an employee who gave me a huge dose of stank face.   Not knowing anything of Dragon Garden I moved on.  Fast forward my last visit to my visit today.  I was met by a different employee and was greeted by a friendly smile!  One of my Yelp friends talked me to try this place and I am glad I did.  

This review is for only the two items I ate.  The BBQ pork here for a fast food spot is on point!  I would have to say it is top three I have had here in Phoenix.   I also had the Singapore noodles which was a first for me.  All I can say is Yummy!  Let me try to explain this one without witnessing how it is prepared.  It is a rice noodle (gluten free) prepared dry with curry flavor shrimp, pork and veggies.  The Singapore noodles is great on it own but adding some delicious BBQ in the mix made this meal over the top.  

I feel that Dragon Garden has not been given a fair shake on Yelp.  If you are in the area, I would say give this place a chance to win you over!  I challenge any experienced Yelper to write a review once you have tried it for yourself.  This restaurant is located in a strip-mall and the interior is not fancy but the food and customer service(minus the scowling lady)is great!  I also hear that this place has a cute girl who works during the week.

British Chefs - 1. American Chefs - 0.

Way to go Gordy for beating America at their own game. Pow, tough blow. Sorry!

Ok, joking aside... wow! Hubby and I have been wanting to visit BurGR for quite a while and the wait was totally worth it. Our first night in Vegas with family visiting from England we brought them here and everybody left happy. 
The Burger choice that dominated our party of 5 was the Farm BurGR (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww) - $15. Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar and a Fried Egg, oh my! I'm not usually one to have Fried Egg's on well anything really but what a combination. With the Burger cooked medium everything worked in perfect harmony. The Egg was perfect, the Beef was perfect and the Cheddar.. Omigosh REAL Cheese!! I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Honestly the best Burger I have had and I have tried a lot in the last 4 years. 
Doesn't it look gooood? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#TEjwrTxroAEuQetkvvbq_Q

- Fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#f3JKGLIzBcGQ8WBlHkvXJg) - $8. Served with Curry Ketchup & Chipotle Ketchup. The Curry Ketchup was delicious but the Fries themselves really were nothing special, just your average deep fried Potato. You could omit these from your meal and not miss them. 

The Milkshakes here are delicious too, more of a Dessert than a Milkshake due to the layer of Pudding on the top of them. My Husband and I decided to share one during our first visit and enjoyed it so much we ended up coming back the following night just so that we could have another. They do take a while to arrive though, probably due to the complexity of making them.

- Shake #4 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#3ESC7tVlSjesQ7UnKDuGRw) $9. Oreo Shake topped with Creme Brulee Pudding, whipped Cream and an Oreo Cookie. Get this one! Seriously. Of the 2 I tried this was by far the best and although Creme Brulee and Oreo together seemed a little wrong to me it turned out to be oh so right.

- Shake #2 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#beA0lKBsYSIdxqCK8lp5Qw) - $9. Strawberry Shake topped with Coconut Pudding and a Chocolate Cookie.

Service was fine, efficient but not amazing but once your food arrives who needs someone coming around every 5 minutes checking up on you anyway.

*TIP*
Very little wait on a Wednesday evening - 6:30pm, 5 people = 10 minutes!

Very disappointed! It's exactly what you expect to find in a pawn shop. Only difference is, they just happen to be famous because their shop is on the History channel. 

Here's a typical day at this place. When you pull up to their building, it's recognizable cuz of what you see on tv. Otherwise it looks just like any other pawn shop place anywhere else.  If you see people lined up outside to get in, chances are you won't find any parking. Wait times vary from 30 mins to an hour (Come on, really? For a pawn shop? SMH). At least if you are in line they have those water sprinkler thingies that spray out mists of water to keep you cool. (about the only positive thing I think). Once you get to the door, there is usually a rude security guy that tells you where to go. When you get in, there is a divider in the middle that directs the flow of traffic like an oval track at a raceway. You will see various items (mostly overpriced). You can stop and look but only if you are actually interested in purchasing something is when the attendants behind the counter will actually talk to you. You'll be lucky if whoever helps you knows anything about what is in the glass cases. I think these people were hired mainly just to make sure nobody does a smash and grab. About halfway down towards the back are mostly pawn shop souvenirs. From what I saw it was mainly Chumlee souvenirs. Why? Go figure. Then you basically do a U-turn and you are on your way out. 

The most bogus thing about this place is the hours of operation. Outside it says 24 hours but you soon find out when you show up late at night that only the pawn shop portion of the place is open 24/7. That means if you have actual merchandise you wanna sell or pawn, you can come in. The portion I mentioned earlier, the day I went that section closed at 9 pm. So if you are just a tourist, the rude security guard at the entrance will announce the store section is now closed, if you are not here to sell or buy any actual display items, then get out. Only the pawn shop section is open 24 hours. I suggest you call them first before you go there because they might be filming or have changed their hours.

As for the actual Pawn Stars people. Don't get too excited. These guys dont actually man the counters. They are usually in the back doing whatever. That is if they are actually there. I was told they only show up for filming and occasional courtesy visits. People tell me that Rick and his old man are really anal if you just happen to catch them. They tend to blow you off thinking they dont have any time for you and that they have more important things to do. Chumlee is a little more receptive and laid back. You'll be lucky if any of these guys even know you are standing there. They got their show so I think that's why they don't care too much for "tourists".

So overall, don't waste your time. I live here so that's why I gave them 2 stars. Yes it's a tourist spot but if you really need to check it out then I suggest you include this on your way to Fremont Experience. It sucks if you paid money for a cab only to be disappointed especially if your hotel and points of interest are off of the main strip.  If you are visiting from out of town, hopefully you have read this first BEFORE you went out there. Otherwise, if you are reading this while in line or afterwards, you will probably give it only 1 star.

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

I've never had a more amazing experience at a Michelin-star restaurant than here...well, maybe Joel Robuchon's other restaurant next door will beat my L'Atelier experience but I'm not going there until next month so I'm letting this sink in 'til then. I was supposed to take myself on a solo birthday dinner date back in August but they were completely booked.  When I remembered to make a reservation it was already weeks after my birthday and the soonest availability was end of September so I went ahead and got my spot...for my sister and I. Now, it all makes sense and I'm thankful the dining gods were with us tonight, we got to meet Joel Robuchon. I'm not a huge fan of celebrities or models and what not...I'm a fangirl of athletes and celebrity chefs! Meeting Joel Robuchon at L'Atelier was a 4/365 chance. Enough of my fangirl babbling.

We sat at the bar area to watch food being prepared - it was such a delight. Our server was Eddie and he has been working here since the day they opened. He took extremely good care of us. Best service I've had anywhere else. All requests granted. He made great recommendations and answered any questions we had about the menu. The manager chatted with us too. Extremely attentive. The sommelier let us try some wines before narrowing it down to what we really want. I got a Riesling and my sister got a Malbec...on top of the Veuve Clicquot we were already drinking.

Aside from the a la carte menu, they have 4 other menus: Menu A ($78: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 1 entree and 1 dessert), Menu B ($105: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert), Pre-Theatre served from 5-6:30pm ($45: amuse-bouche, 1 appetizer and roast of the day) and Seasonal Discovery (11-courses for under $200).

Amuse-Bouche:
Foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and parmesan emulsion. The port wine compliments the richness of the creamy foie gras and the parmesan emulsion adds lightness and saltiness. The Californians sitting next to us were jealous that we can eat foie gras in Nevada and that we have Joel Robuchon in Vegas - they should be. 5/5

Le Saumon:
Salmon carpaccio with fennel-mango salad and lemon essence. The mango they use are not the ripe ones so it's crisp and a bit tart (I love unripe/green mangoes). The salmon is fresh and works well with fennel. 5/5

Le Crabe Royal:
King crab with turnips and sweet and sour sauce. Thinly sliced turnip under and on top of the crab meat. Excellent flavors. 5/5

Les Calamars:
Sauteed calamari and vegetable medley in crustaceous vinaigrette. Lightly cooked calamari. There's olive oil with olive puree on the side of the plate. I'm allergic to olives and seafood/squid but I cleaned my plate - if I died because of this dish, it was worth it! 5/5

La Bisque de Homard:
Lobster bisque with morels and edamame. Lobster, mushrooms and edamame? Excellent! Great consistency and flavor. 5/5

Le Beuf:
Beef cheek with natural jus and vegetables. Super tender beef you can eat with just a fork. 5/5

Le Canard:
Duck with sweet and sour daikon and young leeks. I trust French chefs/restaurants to make a great duck dish...I've never been disappointed. Tender thinly sliced and well-seasoned duck that's perfectly cooked. You get 4 slices of daikon that tastes a bit smokey than sweet/sour. 5/5

Mashed Potatoes:
Very creamy potatoes...no lumps, imperfections whatsoever. Let's ignore the butter and fat content for one night...it's delicious! 5/5

Les Tartes:
Different kinds of tarts: raspberry tart, chocolate, caramel and peanut tart, orange tart, cinnamon tart and pistachio tart. Great sampling of different tarts. My faces were chocolate, caramel and peanut tart, and pistachio tart. 5/5

La Fraise:
Strawberry daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks. I'm a 80's baby so I grew up eating pop rocks and I enjoy re-living my childhood. They're mixed in with the fresh strawberries and the sorbet...you can hear the fizz. The yogurt sorbet is so yummy...and at the bottom is a strawberry daiquiri jelly. 5/5

Le Chocolat:
Chocolate ice cream, cremeux, Araguani dark chocolate and Oreo cookie crumbs. Incredible dessert. Fine-quality chocolate with a good chocolate ice cream and crunch from Oreos. 5/5

I can try real hard to find a flaw but it's just not happening. I'm just laughing at the thought of forgetting whose birthday we were celebrating: mine (August) or my sister's (October). The highlight of the evening was meeting Joel Robuchon and chatting with him. C'es magnifique, Monsieur Robuchon!

Let me paint a better picture of how this started out...

We've been pretty loyal fans of Wynn/Encore for the past few years, but our last visit there was a little on the boring side.  It was time for a change.

My hb wanted to stay at the Monte Carlo, since we thought we'd catch the Jabbawockeez and looked into the Hotel 32.  If you check their website, they market themselves as the upscale, modern, concierge floor of the Monte Carlo.  It seems to be the trend in Vegas for the older hotels to try to keep up with the modern, skyscrapers of today.  

They boast limo pick up service directly from the airport to the hotel, but as soon as we arrived (20 min late mind you, giving the limo driver plenty of time to get there on time) he wasn't there.  When we called the hotel, they said he was already at the airport waiting for us.  LIARS!! Because as soon as we got off the phone with them, the driver himself called us and said he was on his way.  When he arrived, he was polite and apologetic, but obviously, the hotel just decided to try to cover up some back up.  Not a single drink in the limo.  NOT ONE!!  No champagne!  No soda!  Hell...not even a bottle of water!  

They boast a separate lobby and check in desk, but when we arrived, our bell hop told us that check in was closed and we had to check in at the regular desk. I am no princess, and I didn't mind, but when you advertise that as one of your selling points, then by all means, have it open.  When we arrived at the Hotel 32 floor of  the Monte Carlo, low and behold, a separate check in desk was in fact, open.  WTF?

We booked the studio, and I wasn't expecting a huge room.  Well, it certainly wasn't.  400 sq feet.  Tiny, tiny bathroom with no tub, and no toiletries besides the normal shampoo, etc.  No cotton swabs, no cotton balls, etc.  Damn, I didn't pack those on purpose.  There was no ironing board or iron in the rooms, but you can call for it. Problem is, if you need it the next day, there's no place to store it because the room is tiny!!

Ok, so this goes on and on and so does this review.  So, I'll sum up here...

If you can get a free or really cheap upgrade, then sure, this may be worth it. We asked for an upgrade since the room was a box, and they said we could book the one bedroom suite for an extra $200/night! That would make it $450/night.  That's hardly an upgrade.  For that price, we could book a huge suite at the Cosmopolitan and have breakfast on our private terrace. Considering my hb and I love to gamble, we're throwing that and then some on their tables as is.  

Their lounge that serves a light breakfast and dinner is cool, but the food is definitely not worth it.  I would even call it bad if it wasn't free.  But wait, it technically wasn't free, so yes, it was bad.

It's hard to look at life the same way after you've stayed at the Skylofts. We're talking about two story lofts, unbelievably luxurious amenities, just gorgeous designs at every corner, and being able to get anything you want or need with just one phone call.

Everyone here leaves a 5 star review because it's true, the Skylofts give you a true 5 star feeling. At $10,000 a night, it better! Now, keep in mind, I didn't pay that fee. I simply know somebody who gets sponsored by MGM Grand and he extended his generosity to me. Some reviewers claim the Skylofts are worth every penny. Well, even my friend would say that if he had to pay the full fee, it would NOT be worth every penny. If you could have an incredible double suite at Caesar's Palace for $800, who wouldn't do that instead of spending 10 grand?

Like most people who dine at The French Laundry, post the picture of their bill in a very braggadocious manner, and claim it's worth every penny, they usually don't genuinely mean it. Instead, what they're really saying is, "This was insanely expensive and very possibly overpriced. In an attempt to make myself feel better, I will act as if I paid for this comfortably and without a shred of regret, as if my experience was so moving that I would do this as often as financially possible. Here, please act as if you care about this picture of the tab any more than I would care if you posted one. Envy me. Please, envy me. It'll give me the validation I need." 

Now, before I sound too cynical, I should note that I don't mind people who live flashy lives, so long as they earned their possessions from their own work. Hey, if that's what makes you happy, I'm happy. Just try not to unnecessarily rub it in my face. Now, I'll reiterate that there's so much to love at the Skylofts. We're talking private elevators, pool tables, movie rooms, the best personal service, access to private restaurants, and anything you'd expect if you were part of the 1%. There's a reason I got disillusioned and materialistic from Vegas. And, quite surprisingly, the Skylofts was not a huge part of that. It was more from the food destinations, the overall treatment, and the carefree spending of money that left a real impression. In other words, it was the people I was with and their behaviors that impacted me the most, not a physical place. Would I pay $10,000 a night for a Skyloft? Hell no. But was it one of the best experiences of my life? Hell yes. 

To having great friends. And hopefully enjoying life's great experiences without getting too ripped off. After all, I still want to dine at The French Laundry. But I doubt I'll pay for the preposterous $150 corkage fee.

Del Frisco's is as good as it gets in my opinion.  

With some serious dieting ahead of both Terri R and I, a weekend of cheat meals filled our calendar.  I have to be honest, I originally wanted Ruth Chris but they were booked this evening.  So, I ended up making reservations here solely based on other Yelper's reviews.  Great choice Mel! Pat myself on my back time. 

First of all, service was top notch.  It all started with the lovely and very nice, Priscilla.  From start to finish, she was delightful, helpful, and made our dining experience that much better.  Along with great service from Priscilla, we received the same type service from everyone serving the food.  This place is stacked with employees that go out of their way to make you feel like you and your date are the only ones in the restaurant.  Your unsightly empty dishes are swept away with the quickness and they even clean up around you with their handy dandy table swifters.  All this pampering during dinner and you wouldn't even notice it until they're gone

Now for the food.  We got their Prime Pair, which is their $49 per person Prix Fixe. This is a special only running through Labor Day so hurry up peeps.  This is a great deal. 

Prime Par (Prix Fixe)
1.  Salads:  You get your choice of salads from their Del's, Wedge, or Caesar.  We both got their Caesar. Although it was good, it was a just a beast to eat since it wasn't chopped.  Terri worked her way through the salad and I didn't because I thought it was too much work. Not docking Del's because you don't go to a steakhouse and review their salad. 

2.  Dinner Bread:  Nothing special here.  You get a loaf of their sesame bread.  For a place that serves quality food, the bread was less than average.  But again, you don't come to a steak house for bread.  

3.  The entree is an 8 oz hand cut Filet Mignon with your choice of crab cakes, shrimp, or scallops.  I had the crab cakes, which is drenched in lobster sauce.  My goodness....this was delicious.  Terri had the shrimp and she said it was delicious as well.  She offered, but I was focused on my meal.  Now for the filet mignon....this was the 1st highlight.  Great tasting filet, high protein, and tasted like any other top notch steakhouse out here.  I mean it.  This steak can give Ruth Chris a run for their money and it's probably a tad healthier since it's not drenched in butter.  Their steaks didn't have that melt in your mouth feel, but it did have that taste of a well prepped filet. 

4.  Sides:  You also have a choice of sides that included potatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and corn. We got the potatoes, mushrooms, and for an additional cost, added their Lobster Mac N Cheese.  The 2nd highlight to this evening had to be their Lobster Mac.  Creamy/cheesy mac, lobster chunks, and a hint of lobster sauce describes this. Tough to explain, but it's probably the best lobster mac that I have ever had.  

Overall, I am giving Del Frisco's 5 stars because I expected just an okay, above average dining experience and obviously got more.  I was so consumed with my beautiful date and superb dining experience, I even forgot to snap a few photos.  But at a place like this, photos would just ruin the experience anyway. 

Looking for filet mignon, a great dining experience, and somewhere off the strip...look to Del Frisco's.  You won't be disappointed.

I don't normally pay $60 to eat at a buffet, but when I do, it's because I'm in Vegas.  

After all, where else would you have to spend that that much on a buffet?  And while I'd typically prefer to spend that kind of money on a more "traditional" meal, things are a little different when you're in the City of Sin/Gluttony.  So, if I'm going to do some damage at a buffet, I might as well do it right!

Like so many of the better (and pricier) buffets in Vegas, Bacchanal does a great job of combining both quality (for a buffet) and variety in their offerings.  Seriously, there's PLENTY to choose from - seafood (crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, etc.), sushi, salad, pizza, pastas, made-to-order tacos, carvery station (lamb, prime rib, sausages, pork loin, etc.), Asian dishes, fruits, desserts (chocolate covered strawberries!), and more.  

-- PLATE #1 - Prime Rib, Sausage, lamb, Onion Rings
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#mrb056oZjB9C2jzPM-2sYQ)
The guy gave me a cut matching the wellness I wanted, but also with lot of tendons.  Still, the meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The lamb was great as well (perhaps a tad salty) and the sausage was fine, though nothing special.

-- PLATE #2 - Raw Oysters, Fresh Snow Crab Legs, Salmon Sashimi, Tempura Roll
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#IK9Vz3U6qMf6W1-Yi22rNA)
For the most part, Bacchanal's seafood is fresh.  The oysters were plump and meaty (though not as sweet as smaller varieties) and the crab was terrific (too bad no king crab...).  Also, while the tempura roll was rather "meh", the salmon sashimi was pretty good.

-- PLATE #3 - Carne Asada Taco, Carnitas Taco, and Chips with Salsa and Guacamole
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#ITbZBYTJhTZ8GClrU4nLHg)
I had hopes for the tacos since they were cooked to order, but they were just okay.  The taste was fine, but both the carne asada and carnitas were dry and tough.  Not surprising given how small the meat was cut though.

-- PLATE #4 - Lobster Chowder and Kobe Beef Slider
(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#J0kJKgJhIn2HdzgdVPaWOQ)
The chowder was a little salty, but the consistency was spot on.  Impressive for a buffet, though I wish there was more lobster.  The sliders though were easily the worst thing I had.  Sitting under the warmers grossly overcooked the beef.

To deal with the steady crowd that flows in every night, Bacchanal has a pretty good system set-up.  Instead of the usual snaking lines, they have kiosks where you can enter your name, party size, and cell phone number.  After the machine prints out your ticket, you're free to leave until they text you to let you know you're next.  Otherwise, you can pay an extra $15 per person for the "express" option.

While the "express" option is nice, it's also a gamble.  The kiosk quoted a 45-55 minute wait for the two of us, which seemed high since it was quiet on a Thursday night at 8pm.  Still, we declined since we weren't that hungry anyways.  No more than about 5-10 minutes later though, we got a text telling us we were up.  Risky, to say the least.

Although I can't say for myself, I've heard from friends that Wicked Spoon has fallen off a bit as of late.  Between that and how the vast majority of what we had was pretty solid (save for the sliders, but much better overall than Bellagio), Bacchanal just might be my new favorite buffet in Vegas.  Even if it might be by default.

Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.

The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. 

Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. 

Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!

The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The "grains of life" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.

Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.

Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. "Yes, I'll have two desserts." Why not, they're only a couple bucks!

Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!...

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

We arrived at Snooze for what would be our final meal here AZ before heading back home. My sister claims this is her favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix--which is a huge recommendation considering every breakfast here has been terrific. As I perused the menu I noticed they had a nice selection of fancy pancakes and they all sounded terrific. My Brother-in-law pointed out that they had a thing called the "Pancake Flight" where you can choose any three flavors you want.

Pancake Flight:

Pineapple Upside Down Pancake- I had to get this since it was one of the Yelp Review Highlights, and it was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype. I actually would've appreciated more Pineapple in it. While it was good, I doubt I'd order it again. 3*

Molten Chocolate Lava Pancake- This was a little slice of Heaven; it's a chocolate buttermilk pancake with a huge dollop of chocolate custard in the middle and topped with a Tangerine Glaze. Oh, yeah.. it's as good as it sounds. 4.5*

Pancake of the Day- Snooze features a different Pancake everyday, so be sure to ask your server before making any final decisions. On the day I was there it was some kind of Salted Caramel/Cinnamon concoction with a dollop of Ancho-Chocolate Custard in the middle. My jaw dropped as our waitress described it--much as yours did as you read my description. It was superb, and if you're lucky enough to be there when they feature it you *must* get it. 5*

Chocolate-Peanut Butter- My wife ordered this as a side to her eggs, and it was so massive I had to help her finish it--one of the perks when you're married to a light eater! It was pretty good, and tasted a lot like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I'm not a huge Reese's fan, but if you are then this should be right up your alley! 3.5*

Coffee- Above-standard Diner Coffee, but nothing special. They have a whole placard on your table ballyhooing their coffee, but I just didn't get it. 3.5*

Service & Ambiance- Our server was excellent, and I wish I could remember her name and give her credit, but I misplaced the receipt as well. She was a tall, pretty brunette--you can't miss her. Snooze is a very clean and modern-looking, but I found some of their decorations to be a bit cloying--especially that huge asterisk logo thingy. The place also gets very loud, which I don't particularly want first thing in the morning. Time to invest in some sound dampeners, me thinks. 4.5*-service/2.5*-Ambiance

Value- Standard AZ value of less than $10 for breakfast, but still cheaper than Cali pricing. 4*

Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast here at Snooze; I was tempted to give it a 5th star, but the noise factor was a bit of a turn-off. I'd still probably say it's a solid 4.5-star breakfast joint, and I'd definitely go again and again if I lived in the area; I'll just try to remember to bring some earplugs next time.

Great location, reasonable cost, ridiculous noise policies, incompetent management. I'll never stay here again and do not recommend it to anyone.

I stayed at Elara with a group of friends. We booked the 1 bedroom suite for 2 nights at a reasonable $460. Friends who had enjoyed their previous stays recommended it. Being attached to Planet Hollywood, Elara is in a great location just a short distance to a Fat Tuesday's and Cosmopolitan.

We checked in around midnight. Valet was full. Settled into our spacious room and got ready to roam Sin City.

Came back to Elara around 4am. We were talking and laughing, recounting whatever had just happened. Sometime afterward, security was at our door informing us that a noise complaint had been filed against us.

Wait, what? Where are we? Oh yeah. VEGAS.

Security explained the 3 strike noise policy: 1) warning 2) unregistered guests kicked out 3) all guests kicked out. BTW, this is your 1st strike.

Slightly confused that we had been reported, we complied and lowered our voices for the rest of the night.

The next day, we worked out at the decent-sized gym. We bought a cabana by the pool. Zanibeth (?) was an excellent waitress!

Around 5am, we came back from Marquee (quick walk across the street) and late night eating. After a super awkward cab ride back, we started to ready for bed/pack since check out was in 5 hours. Our sensitive neighbors must have had security on speed dial, waiting for our arrival, because barely 10 minutes after we returned, security was back at our door telling us we hit our 2nd strike.

After TEN minutes!

I wish housekeeping responded that promptly.

We were winding down and would have been asleep/quiet in the next 20 min. Come on!

I stood there in disbelief as he told the unregistered guests to leave. He stood at the door and waited impatiently. He didn't even give them time to collect their belongings.

The remaining guests and I tried to reconcile what had just happened. It wasn't that we were surprised they followed policies, but we couldn't believe the noise level we were at after just ten minutes of being back warranted a noise complaint.

We called the front desk to better understand what had just happened. They transferred us to Mike in security who explained that the complaint was for "loud talking and loud laughing." He was very understanding after we explained our side of the story and eventually convinced his supervisor to allow our guests to return to the room.

I was still upset that we even had to deal with this disruption on our last night in VEGAS, so my friend and I spoke to the front desk in the morning. I was ready to write off Hiltons (I prefer Starwood anyway), but my friend convinced me to give them a chance to rectify the mishap. Stephanie at the front desk empathized with us and suggested that perhaps next time we could be on a higher floor where guests might not be so conservative. However, she didn't have the power to do so, so she brought her manager into the mix.

Enter manager (I didn't even get her name). She had just been at Elara for 3 days. Three days! We asked her when quiet hours were since we weren't told at check in and she didn't know when they were either. She kept emphasizing that there was an infraction and security was just following their policies. We weren't arguing that the policy was enforced; we were trying to understand why we weren't educated about what to expect when we checked in. It was a long conversation that essentially went nowhere:

Manager: The Hilton Grand Vacations Club is more for families and plenty of the guests may prefer to sleep early. Security was trying to please our neighbors. She couldn't compensate us for the noise infraction.
Us: It must be a branding issue since they're connected to PH not Circus Circus. If that's the case, we shouldn't stay there if we're not the target clientele and the noise problem could be solved by telling everyone else we know not to stay there if they plan to party in Vegas. Elara was referred by others and we knew other guests staying there that weekend. We planned to share our negative customer experience with everyone we knew to advise them not to stay there.

She let us leave completely unhappy, even more so than at 5am. She seemed powerless and unwilling to find any way to appease us. She didn't grasp the impact word of mouth reviews have on losing business. She didn't believe "the customer's always right". She wasn't trained in issue remediation. She was ignorant of what makes a good consumer experience (www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory/customer-impact/assets/pwc-experience-radar-hospitality.pdf)

I travel frequently for business and I understand the value of a quiet hotel room. I understand that not everyone comes to Vegas to party, but if a hotel has strict policies like this, they should educate their guests from the start. I guess Hilton has some customer service training to do.

I tweeted this to @HiltonHHonors. Let's see what they do.

So I guess Imperial Palace is now QUAD RESORT & CASINO. But, it's the same place. Please read my review of IP before reading this review. You can find it right over here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:PmcM2qPVlg96fjp2d6ut7g

And I just want to add, about 5 months ago I got into a fight with that bald headed boob(I think his name is Kevin or Carl), who is the manager of this place. He literally told me that "YELP SUCKS" and even taunted me to write a bad review. Let me explain to you why this fight occurred:

One of my friends came to town and decided to stay here because of the cheap room rates. She lived in West Hollywood most of her life, so she felt comfortable in this atmosphere. But, even West Hollywood can't compare to the f*cked up shit you find here at IP. Just to let you guys know, there was 2 assaults and what might have been a robbery or attempted robbery here on the same floor my friend was staying at. Like I mentioned in my previous review, for the last 2 years there has been a network of thieves who take advantage of the "door defect" that most of the doors here at IP have. The doors have a slight defect where they don't close 100%, and you actually have to slam the door twice to fully close it. The thieves know about this defect and due to the fact that IP has no security guards in front of the entrances to their towers, these thieves have been running this cycle for years. Read all the reviews on IPs page, many of the reviews are from yelpers who fell victim to this network of robbers. While visiting my friend, I actually saw the guys this time. They attempted to try to trick me and pretend they were just guests. They said "hello" to me while they suspiciously walked down the hallway. Both men had New Yorker accents. A few minutes later a lady runs down the hallway telling me that those guys entered her room and then ran out when they noticed she was still inside. The hotel manager is a total rat.  The guests who were almost robbed asked the guy to at least comp their stay and the manager literally tells them: "we don't comp for that. It wasn't our fault." He then tells the guests that the hotel management is aware of  the door malfunction defect and he even went out of his way to show her a small sign that read: "we are not responsible for the door not closing". What this means is that the hotel managers are all cheap motherf*ckers and won't put in the extra cash to fix the defect on the doors. When I was going back to my friends room, the moment we got out of the elevator there was a group of college kids getting the sh!t kicked out of them by more weirdos with New York accents. Now, my friend didn't want to stay here anymore. I asked that bald boob at the front desk for a room change and he practically tells me to f*ck off.  

I saw my 2nd assault of the trip at the Pet Stay area. A family was walking their dog to the pet area and some d-bag threw a glass bottle off their balcony at them. The security guard never showed up. 

Here is the most interesting part... The managers let me know that they think "Yelp is a joke". When I told them that I would write about this on Yelp, he started getting really sarcastic and said that Yelp has no effect on there business. He expressed that no matter how many 1-star ratings they get on Yelp, problem gamblers from out of state will always choose IP because they save money on lodging which means they get to have more money for gaming. 

There is probably like a 90% chance that something like this will happen to you. For example: You will go down to the poker room to play some cards. When you come back to your room, you notice your door is open. You find your daughter  tied up in the closet, badly beaten. Your wife's neck is snapped. Your oldest son has been thrown off the balcony onto Carnival Court, and no one noticed because of how loud it is. Your youngest son has been abducted and is already being sold to a Thai brothel who will force-inject him with female hormones in order to make him into a transgendered child prostitute. At that moment you will start to think to yourself: "Maybe I should have listened to that weird Tetsuro guy on Yelp, or at least listened to all the negative reviews instead of trying to save $10 a night!"  But, then you decide that you need to rescue your son and avenge your family, so you head off to Thailand and use your special forces training to fight the gangsters that took your son to find out that it was those Australian guys from "Human Nature" who were behind it all along. And all this happened cause you decided to stay at IP for the week.

Currently, I've actually decided to film a documentary style video about how dangerous, filthy, and disgusting IP is. In Feb I get 2 free nights through Total Rewards, and while I'm staying there I will document the door defects and hopefully capture one of the many assaults on video. I will upload it on my youtube channel.

Interesting Fact: The father owns Sapphire Gentleman's Club and his son owns El Dorado Cantina - that's why they share the same massive blue Sapphires building. Don't worry, you can still come here with nana and little Tommy - El Dorado's entrance and dining room is separate from Sapphires and just a couple of steps to the left of the strip club's entrance. 

Parking: If you see the massive blue glowing Sapphires building, you're at the right place. Turn into their parking lot, try to dodge the shitty cab drivers all lined up at Sapphires and snag yourself a parking spot right in front. 

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but ever since I moved here from Southern California, I pretty much wrote off Mexican cuisine, until now. I've had way too many terrible experiences and disappointments - I couldn't find any of the juicy and spicy flavors I was looking for.

Well, that all changed when I tasted El Dorado's trio of salsas, I knew from the very first bite, that my dinner would follow suit with how incredible the salsas tasted. They have 3 different spice levels mild (roasted green tomatillo), medium (charred chipotle), and crazy spicy (habanero). They don't mess around here! The spicy habanero salsa had lots of smashed chunks of habanero chilies; so let this be your warning, it's spicy but also so damn flavorful. I didn't have a favorite because they were all so incredibly flavorful. The best salsas I've had in a while. Flavor rating: 5/5

Here's what we ordered:

Tostaditas de Tinga $5.50 (Gluten Free) - Flavor rating: 5/5
You can order these from the small bites/appetizers menu and they are crazy good! Super moist and flavorful chipotle marinated chicken with grilled onions, served over fresh crispy tostadas, topped with flavorful refried beans, queso fresco, sour cream, and (mild red) salsa cascabel - comes with 3 for $5.50 or $2.75 during happy hour! It looks simple, but the flavors are explosive! Top them with any one (or all) of the trio salsas they give you, for an extra added wow! 

Al Pastor $9.50 - Flavor rating: 3/5
Marinated pork with pineapple chunks, cilantro, onion & lime. Comes with three tacos per platter, served with moist and perfectly seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans - get the refried beans! Typically, I wouldn't care for beans, but they're very moist and packed with amazing flavor. They aren't the best or most authentic al pastor tacos I've ever had, but the tacos were very moist and everything on the plate tasted freshly prepared. The al pastor meat was a tad mild in flavor and spices for my taste. Yet, everything else on the dish was seasoned perfectly. 

Chicken Enchiladas $13.50 - Flavor rating: 4/5
Slow cooked chicken breast marinated in chiles, wrapped in fresh corn tortillas & cheese, topped with mild and flavorful green tomatillo sauce, sour cream & queso fresco. 
Served with delicious and well seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans. The portion size is generous and filling. We enjoyed the flavor of the moist enchiladas and with added dollops of salsa of each bite. 

We also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca. It was refreshing and not too sweet, but I think it was slightly watery for my preference. It's still perfect for warm weather, spicy food and I enjoyed it. Flavor rating: 3/5

I'm a huge fan of this place! The chef truly shines at his talent and you can really taste the care that went into each preparation. I can tell it's been taste-tested before served and I'm a fan of restaurants that pride themselves in quality control. Plus, the service we received from KAI that evening was top-notch. He went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. 

Other important details: 

Happy Hour twice a day:
* 3pm - 6pm - $1 street tacos, 1/2 off bottled domestics & wells
* 11pm - 2am - 1/2 off all appetizers, 1/2 off bottled domestics & wells

Pro tip: during the day it's more-so family friendly and during the late-night-owl hours and onward, there is more of a mature crowd with a sprinkle of girls off the clock grabbing their dinner after work.

I came for one of my favorite peoples birthday. There were so many people interested that a few of us made a reservation of a few smaller tables and then just asked if we can be seated together.

While I wasn't there to witness it, it seemed this was OK with the GM as the bday girl talked to him. She had to email the reservations manager according to them who tried to make us take these pre fixe group menu or impose a spending minimum. NO. We have 3 separate reservations and not some ginoromous group even with all of us. No. Those group menus weren't interesting to most of us. We just asked to be in tables near each other. It put a bad taste in my mouth and almost cancelled if it wasn't a point we can argue out of. I get trying to let us know as a option and to maybe be easier for the kitchen but any other parties of 6- 10 people wouldn't have this imposed on them I'm sure. It's only because we asked to sit by each other. 

We arrived at dinner - and no, we didn't do the group menus. 

It took a little while to get orders in and get bread, but once the dinner rolled on the pace was good and food came in a fairly timely manner. As a side note, I think iPad menus are not needed. It froze up quite a few times on us and talked about antipasto platters that were not on the main menu you could miss. It also talked about alcoholic beverages that were in the wine list booklet already. 

Breadservice was good. There was a small pot of herb focaccia, some crisps and breadsticks and a tray of condiments- pesto, finishing salt, red pepper, lemon marscapone butter, fried capers

I decide to split up some items with my friend Anthony. 

Caponata had pleasant texture of the veggies were good, but a tad too sweet. I like when it's sweet and tangy. It could have been a big hit for me with a bit of acidity. I tried to offset with a bit of the fried capers and red pepper from the condiment tray. This really should come with some nice bread though. It was okay on the crisp and the focaccia, but I didn't get enough bread as the basket was small and there were 6 people.

Grilled octopus - simple flavors, but the octopus was tender. Everything was cooked nicely, but I wish there was something to give the octopus with diced potatoes some oomph. A nice puree, sauce, veloute to add a little something.

Marsala chicken meatballs were decent. I like that it wasn't too sweet as marsalas can be but more a wine-y flavor.Came with a few mushrooms and 2 small tomatoes on the stem.

Veal Saltimbocca was lovely.Nicely crisp, the cheese stuffing was solid and it was well seasoned. I like the incorporation of sage on it. It was a good size, maybe about 14-16oz.

Crispy Polenta was our side for the veal. It was simple, but good though mine wasn't really crisp. I enjoyed the tomato sauce that was on it. 

Dessert cart I chose a honey, chocolate and almond tart. This was almost perfect. The florentine cap on top was money. The texture of the chocolate filling was nice but a tad too sweet along with the honey and would have preferred a bitter chocolate to offset. However, it was really well made and still pretty damn good. 

Out of my meal, the standout was the veal saltimbocca. It was the singular item I would order again and considering it was the most expensive then perhaps it was a good thing that it was worth it. 

Service was OK, but had some hiccups. Like I mentioned earlier it took a moment to take off as I don't know why the server was going to our table, answer questions then disappeared a few times. The bussers were a little too plate eager. I had my plate taken while I was still eating bread but turned to have a conversation and found it gone. We took the bone off the veal then split it in half and place it on my individual plate. A moment after the plate was being lifted from us and I had to say wait! the lemon and the sauce was still on there so he placed the dish of the sauce on the table as I took the lemon and left. Sucks because the veal bone has all those good little pieces left and he took my utensils on the plate. 

Apparently our other table had hiccups too. Most notable is being poured water like crazy and getting charged $64 for still water. Really, they should have been asked if they wanted to order more. The water was not branded bottles even. Its the reusable kind that Echo&Rig use for their water which they give you for FREE. 

Now the food ultimately is what it is about. It was good, but nothing blew my mind. It was good, but not on par with its cost.When you have a town where there are some good off strip fresh pasta, seasonal ingredient Italian food, I have other, better options. On top of that, I am a bit critical of some things I believe I do well at home. A few people had the risotto and it did not hold up to the one the fiance and I make - their words, not mine. 

It's not a bad  meal, but I think there are better experiences I've had on and off the strip that I would return to first before stepping here.

Where do I even begin! When I first heard of a Mexican Asian restaurant opening up, I had no idea what to expect but I figured that since I like both cuisines, I would probably enjoy it. I was right. They did a great job fusing the cuisines. In fact, what took the relationship so long to bloom!? 

Ambiance:

Looks are deceiving and the exterior of this place looks nothing like the interior. From the outside, you'd think it just looks like any other generic restaurant, but don't be deceived. Step through the doors and you immediately enter this open, airy and trendy restaurant that even has a real tree hanging out in the middle of the restaurant...yes a tree! I especially found the pictures of random people on the chairs pretty entertaining. The restaurant itself has a combination of a wrap around bar and then dining area. Make a reservation to be on the safe side! This is great spot for a night out with friends, a double date or event a spot to get a couple cocktails and apps! 

Food & Drinks: 

Now, moving on to the most important part, food and drinks! First, the drinks. I enjoyed the Passion Fruit sangria and boy does that pack a punch! I expected it to be sweet, but instead it was pretty potent...in a good way! Next, the food. This restaurant is all about sharing the plates and it's nice because that means you can try much more! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so our group of four ordered it all! 

Guacamole - they serve up some of the most unique guacamole choices I've ever seen! We decided to order the Lump Crab Guacamole. I'm ruined because I don't think I will ever be able to enjoy "regular" guacamole again. It was the perfect amount of crab and the key lime added a tasty twist. The only downfall was that it only came with four tortilla chips and if you wanted to order more, it was $1 more per order of chips. The guacamole is already $14, so with the additional chips, it made for a pricey appetizer! 

Rock Shrimp Tempura - I'm such a fan of rock shrimp and especially when it has some Asian flavoring to it. This dish was anything but disappointing and I could have gobbled this dish up all by myself! The rock shrimp tempura comes with a variety of veggies including tomatoes and green beans. The summer mayo had the perfect flavorful kick to it. I want my own order next time!

Rollo Chingon Sushi Roll (cooked) - This roll comes with grilled shrimp, guacamole, jalapeno and has a balsamic strawberry glaze. See where they do a good job fusing the two cuisines? I had no idea I was eating a Mexican food sushi roll because it tasted delicious! It came with eight bites and was great for sharing.

Suzuki Roll - This roll was another great Mexican Asian combo with spicy tuna, avocado, and then a chipotle aioli! They have eight bites in a roll so this was another good one to share and very flavorful. 

Summer Corn - order this! I loved it and could have eaten it all on my own. The spiced popcorn on top of the corn created an interesting yet flavorful kick to it! 

Bacon Wrapped Dates - an order comes with six, so there's plenty to share however you will want more than one! These little guys are so good! The combination of salty bacon and sweet date compliments each other perfectly.

Half Lobster _ Crab Dynamite - order this but be warned, you won't want to share! This was the best thing I ate on the menu! 

After my experience, I would say that my top three favorite things I ate were the rock shrimp, corn and lobster/crab. I would order the three items next time but I would probably order the lobster as my own entree next time. It's that good!

Jos Andrs has brought umami back. But, he's not only brought it back, he's redefined it. Think of it as umami 2.0. With 20 mouthwatering courses, his avant garde brand of sweet and savory cuisine will slap your taste buds around like a night with Ike Turner and Chris Brown. 

This is dinner theater at it's best. It's a 2.5+ hour interactive show in a private room located within Jaleo. After checking in at the hostess stand we were seated at a table in Jaleo and brought complimentary glasses of cava while the previous seating finished (There are two seatings of 8 per night at  at 5:30 and 8:30). When ready, we were escorted to the back and entered a space beautifully designed by the Rockwell Group and Spanish designer Juli Capella. Two of the walls are lined with card catalogs with several drawers open and holding artifacts that tie into memories from Jos's past. It's an intriguing space that's equal parts Dali, Pan's Labyrinth, and Alice In Wonderland.

In the center of the room is an 8 seat bar where the chefs create and plate the evening's meal. Much of the actual "cooking" is performed out of site in the Jaleo kitchen but the plating is done in front of the diners at the bar. Throughout the evening there was plenty of interaction with the chef's and we were encouraged to ask questions and learn more about the chefs and dishes. It was cool to see them at work. Who knew tweezers and pipettes were such important kitchen tools? Each dish was a work of art... a really delicious work of art.

I'm not articulate enough to describe how creative or tasty each dish was. So if you want a complete breakdown of every course you're better off reading this guy's review: http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.html

But, here are a few notable dishes that I loved:
- Beet jewelry. Playful, crunchy and delicious. I never thought beets could be so amazing.
- Membrillo and la serena cone. A flaky cone filled with a creamy, tangy sheep's milk cheese.
- Bocata de Calamares. An homage to the calamari sandwiches Andrs used to eat on the beach, this sammie had uni in place of calamari and it was delicate, briny masterpiece.
- Cigala with Roses. Typically, I hate foams because they add little to dishes. But here, it added a noticable texture and flavor to the lobster.
- Secreto of Ibrico Pork. The best dish of the night. The best piece of pork I've ever tasted. This was the pig equivalent of A5 kobe beef. Amazing!
- Frozen Apricot Coulant. Similar to a chocolate lava cake in that you cut it open and liquid oozes out. It's a delicious and unique fruity dessert.
- 25 Second Bizcocho. The best microwaved food ever. It had the texture of a sponge cake and had a creamy filling.

Honestly, I could probably list a few more dishes that I loved. There wasn't a *bad* dish all night, but the weakest were the two they had to supplement because of my apple allergy. I can't fault them for that.

The service was exceptional. Truly the best service I've ever experienced. There were two hosts (and I say hosts because dining at  is like dining in their home), Anthony and Stephanie, who were able to accommodate dietary/allergic restrictions, serve and clear dishes throughout the night and answer any question we had. It was professional but not stuffy. They're also not shy about keeping your glasses full. Wine was included in the price and Anthony and Stephanie were generous with the pours all night. It was like dining with an open bar.

The price for the meal, as others have mentioned, is $250 per person. That includes wine, gratuity, and tax. In order to get reservations you have to email them. It's best to plan ahead and email them at least a month before you'd like to dine there. If you're a local, the more flexible you are with your dates (a weeknight instead of dining on a weekend) might make it easier for you to get in. For out of towners, make sure you tell them the dates you'll be in town and they'll try to fit you in. For me, after I initially emailed them I got an automated response right away followed by a dining reservation a couple weeks later.

In the end,  was the most entertaining and amazing dining experience, although not necessarily the *best* meal ever. But, I'd put it in the top 3 that I've had. It's pricey but worth it for a once in a lifetime experience and a peek inside the mind and food memories of Jos Andrs.

The Countess, she is beautiful, she is talented, she is delightful and she is bountiful, she is saucy (in the "salsa" sense of the word, not the "descarado" sense of the word:)...she's also cheap:)

But then again, so am I:)

It's Taco Tuesday (as I write this...who knows when I'll finish it and post it...maybe next Taco Tuesday...maybe not:)

But today, I needed to retox after my run along the mighty Scottsdale River (or the Crosscut Canal as the flatlanders refer to it:)

I was going to wander over to Cien Agave, when my buddy called and said he'd gotten done with an open heart surgery early (usually, that's a very bad sign, but not today...he said everything went "swimmingly":) but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands, he too was in need of a retox:)

We agreed that it was time to go see The Countess:)

I've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren, I thought "I'll be the judge of that!":)

Not that I don't trust the reviews...I do, or I wouldn't have jumped in the rig, pulled the belts tight and lit the turbocharger in order to get my retox going:)

No..."trust, but verify"...those words were given to all of us during an episode of Death Valley Days by a nearly washed up actor (whose name escapes me at the moment)... 

http://tinyurl.com/yfg9e39

Well, it's all true enough...the black mole chicken is subtle but spicy...the cochinita is saucy and inviting...the dog shark taco may be made with the only fish that travels well to the desert (no, don't get too excited...not the best fish taco I ever had...but very good:)

And more than enough to eat from an inexpensive platter of softball sized tacos (I know, I called The Countess "cheap" a few paragraphs ago, but what I meant was a solid value:)...Two big, round, tumescent taco's with rice and frijoles'...$7.59, USD:)

And plenty of salsa...oh yes...lots and lots of salsa...saucy, saucy salsa:)

None of the legendary "strawberry salsa" today (probably like the Yeti...plenty of sightings, but no actual evidence:)...but I didn't care...they still had a dozen salsas to choose from:)

And all the salsas seemed to complement my taco's...how is it even possible that Peanut Salsa and Smokey Chipotle Salsa BOTH taste exquisite with the moles and the pork shoulder?

I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)

As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself "well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?" :-)

After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)

We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)

Do you think The Countess will go for that?

EAT, pretty simply put, how could I go wrong as I Yelped up a something to eat this morning for some breakfast before returning home from Vegas? 

I generally stay clear of the places that appear so sublime on Yelp, but I was hungry and I was biting on the the Yelp hook again for a relatively new place with a short track record. My GPS in the rent-a-car told me this place didn't exist WTF was this some kind of Yelp trick? I found it anyway a half dozen blocks down from the Fremont Street Experience downtown, nestled under an old apartment complex.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#1FLXhCFNGaHKlo7mePjUCQ  Maybe 707 never existed before Eat made her home here???

After feeding the meter across the street I crossed and hesitantly I walked into a nicely appointed, clean semi industrial, semi earthy space of a restaurant  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#5hwJW33twIKPbYqGXborAw  with only a few customers and was greeted by a tall dude (forget his name) with face full of jewelery, a punker hair-do and a dark gothish demeanor. He showed me to a table and got me some coffee right off. Nice guy.

As I read the menu I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore Toto, there were a bunch of menu choices that were out of the box and sounded very promising. http://eatdowntownlv.com/breakfast/

FOOD ORDERED:
Truffled Egg Sandwich Two farm-fresh scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon and smashed potatoes

WHAT I GOT:
Truffled Egg Sandwich and some country style fried potatoes. The sammy was great, yummy thick sliced bacon atop a couple of fried eggs laced with shrooms and some chives and a kiss of feta cheese crumbles on a croissant roll. This sammy was good! And the taters were well seasoned and tasty as well. 4.5*****STARS
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#atNQH5fb6TgXBd6UtOgXkw

The service was great too. Plenty of refills, checked on me couple times too. Had their s**t together.  4.5 **** Stars

I also briefly met Natalie Young  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#kz1WySQnziPX0GxnBQvwQA the chef / owner as she was kicking it with a few patrons at the table next to me. She seemed like a very nice and down to earth gal.

She explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. I can believe it if the Lunch and Dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. While a little pricey (still cheaper than the Vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.

This place is as cool, hipster, and the food is as good as you are likely to find in a local Las Vegas eatery. Its a local downtown eating establishment that's not on the beaten path when it comes to locale or food. This place is what most trendy LA places wish they were  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#lSlXZcBJk6tow9WEoEUcsw hip with legit with great food and real atmosphere.

I gotta try the chicken fried steak next time it looked awesome!

I'll be back, next time in Vegas!

After hearing so much about Taco Taco I suggested it for dinner this last weekend. We made the drive across town and arrived around 9 pm. I could see as I was opening up to the door that nobody else was in line so I was a little nervous but with all of the hoopla and the drive over we wanted to give Taco Taco a shot. 

The signs above easily direct you to the line you want to order from. I knew I had to try the "Al Pastor Tacos" so I ordered 2 of those. I asked for pineapple but the worker said they didn't have any. I have seen other pictures with pineapple so they must have just been out for the day. I then made my way over to where hubby was at and I ordered a "Cheese Quesadilla" and a "Asada Taco". Hubby had already ordered a "Asada Burrito". You can choose corn or flour tortillas and they do make them right in front of you. By the time we finished ordering the place had filled up so we beat the rush! We grabbed our food and headed towards the back and found a pretty nicely sized dining area. There was a salsa bar with a variety of stuff. I didn't get anything from the salsa bar so I can't comment on if it was good or not. I can however comment on the following:

Cheese Quesadilla - This was priced at $2.25 and very good! It was filled with the perfect amount of cheese and wasn't really greasy. I would order this again.

Al Pastor - Priced at $2.00 each these didn't blow my socks off. It was missing the pineapple I love so much and just lacked the flavor I have had at other places. This is usually my favorite thing to order but not so much here. I will probably give it another try on a different day to see if something is different but if not I wouldn't order it again.

Asada Tacos - These were amazing. Such good flavor! I wish I had gotten more of these than the al pastor but I will know for next time. 

Asada Burrito - I didn't like this. Hubby gave me some to try and it just didn't have the same flavor as the asada in the tacos. They did pull the asada meat for the burrito from a different place then the asada that was on the grill for the tacos so I don't know if they make them different but I will personally stick to the asada tacos instead of the burrito.

They offer rice bowls and have vegetarian options. I can't say I will make the effort to drive across town just to eat at Taco Taco but when I am in the area I will stop in for sure since it is a cheap and good.

Alert the media!!!
Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after "Buffalo Bill", the cowboy showman...but "Bills" is an acronym for "Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls").
I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:)
Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask? 
Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know.
Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year.
So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:)
It's our good fortune, really. 
I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs.
And yet, they're just hot dogs. 
Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs.
The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me).
They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc. 
And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs!
And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs!
It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's. 
In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:

* Wait
     o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat
     o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!

* Ordering
     o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down ("sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)
     o Bianco's - "You want what on that pizza?!?! Chris will not make "his" pizza that way"! "Did you get my wine and cheese order Mr. Shaved Head-non-responsive bartender at Bar Bianco...hello...hello"? "Yes, I know I told you check with me every hour during the wait, but now that's annoying me"

* Price
     o Ted's - 2 foot longs and diet coke for $11? That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)
     o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)

For the local "Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:)
Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!

I'll have to say this for the Rooste...I've never had a better time when food that bad was involved.  The good times start as soon as you walk in and are shown to your table.  The restaurant is downstairs from the entrance level, so you have your choice of using the steps or a sliding board.  Trust me on this, take the slide.  You won't believe that you had forgotten how much fun they are.  Once you take a selfie, it's time to hop up from the slide and head to your table.  This involves walking past the main stage where a country-western band is playing.  As we walked by they were playing Margaritaville.  It seemed so out of place, yet at the same time made sense.  Once you get to your table, if you are wearing flip-flops the first thing you'll notice is that you have sawdust in your toes.  This truly is a sawdust joint.  With that taken care of, the seven of us slid into a horseshoe-shaped table ready for a celebration feast.

A few people in the group decided to indulge in an adult beverage, and the look on their faces when their scotch on the rocks showed up in mason jars was priceless.  They should have known better; the pewter dinnerware was a dead giveaway of what to expect.  And with that it was time to order appetizers.  It was a unanimous decision to go for the fried rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries.  For $18 you get a platter of mostly fried cactus, along with a few pieces of rattlesnake.  It's a total gimmick, but everyone does it just to say they ate rattlesnake.  The snake pieces tasted like deep fried clam strips, but without the tartar sauce.  Nothing to write home about, but glad I did it.

As we waited for our entres to arrive, we were served salad for the table in a huge, woven salad bowl.  It was your basic bagged iceberg mix, but loaded with so much dressing that it was one of the highlights of the night.  For dinner I decided to go with the steak and enchiladas platter, and added on a baked potato and jalapeno/bacon mac & cheese.  According to the menu the cut of steak was sirloin, but I'm pretty sure it was more along the lines of either a loafer or a work boot.  I could barely get my knife through it.  And trying to chew it was next to impossible.  I was hoping to have more luck with the enchiladas, but all you could taste was corn tortillas and canned enchilada sauce.  No one else at our table was pleased with their entre either.  But the mac & cheese was very good.  

With dinner out of the way, they bring you complimentary cotton candy.  Score!  At this point, a tableside magician also showed up.  He was pretty damn impressive, and I was sitting right next to him and couldn't keep up with the sleight-of-hand.  He was at our table for about 15 minutes, and we enjoyed every second of it.

Finally it was time for dessert.  Earlier in the evening, a table near us was celebrating a birthday and a bunch of the staff came out to sing to them.  One of my buddies texted me from across the table, and said we should prank one of the other guys in our group and have it be his birthday.  A quick word with the waitress when nobody was paying attention, and the plan was in place.  For $15, you get served an eclair with a birthday candle that was easily big enough for 8-10 people, along with the singing staff and one person playing the triangle.  The beauty of the plan is that the prankee was seated dead-center, and had no way to escape.  My absolute favorite part of the night was when he started protesting that it wasn't his birthday, and one of the waiters looked him dead in the eye and said "It is tonight!".  So he sat there, with an oversized cowboy hat planted on his head, and played along like a trooper.  You also get your picture taken for the website.  And the true bonus is that the eclair was pretty damn good!

And with that, it was time to bid farewell.  Like I said earlier, I had an amazing time there.  It's like a southwestern dude ranch mixed with Medieval Times and South of the Border.  It's just too bad that the food is horrendous.  A 5-star entertainment experience mixed with 1-star food should average out to three stars.  But at the end of the day you are there for the food, so I have to come in at two stars.  One star if you don't ride the sliding board.

After seeing Guy rave about this place on "DDD"  and having many yelper friends telling hubby and myself that we needed to try this place I finally gave in. A lot of the reason it took so long to try is because I am not fan of burgers. While hanging out with one of our best-est buddies Joshua G and his wifey we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.

Upon entering there were plenty of tables open but maybe not enough servers or something. The hostess told us as well the customers coming in after us that there would be a small wait so the severs could catch up. After being seated our drink orders were taken right away. I have to say the service here is great. Our server was fantastic. 

I knew I wasn't going to order a burger so I took a look at what sides and salads they had to offer. I decided to go junk food style and order some "Crispy Onion Rings" priced at $3.50 and "Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries" priced at $4.50. The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were good but I sure didn't taste any garlic. Paying extra money to have the garlic fries I do expect it to actually taste like garlic fries. My man ordered a "Bachi Burger" and added cheddar cheese and bacon. He did enjoy the burger but not for the price. I feel personally that for the price of the burger it should have came with fries instead of paying separate for them. I don't want to go to a burger place that looks like they just threw a few random *fancy* things on the walls just so they can charge me a la carte for everything. I have no problem paying a la carte for a establishment that enforces a dress code and doesn't have kids running around the tables. 

Bachi Burger doesn't taste terrible but is not worth another trip for me. It doesn't have any *wow* factor for the price.

SUNDAY BRUNCH:

What a terrific way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning.  This brunch has it all from the character, atmosphere, unique brunch items and service.  I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. 

To say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my left and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. 

I did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. 

The sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.

The juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.

And on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  

4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  

Breakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  

You've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!

Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.  

I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  

The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).  

The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.  

All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.

I have a million things I need to do today but they are ALL on hold so I can write about how awesome this place is. They are not even fully up and running (Grand Opening is 9 July, folks) and they've already won me over. Why?

Their Espresso is at the top of my list. It is very well balanced: not too weak, not too bold, not too bitter and a really pleasant aftertaste that makes for a well-rounded consumption of coffee. Maybe my response was psychosomatic but it really took me back to Europe for a moment.

I read about their beignets and the reports are not exaggerated. They are fried up perfectly light and just a tad crispy. As much as I love donuts this was such a step up I don't know if I can ever go back. 

So my first visit here was like a mini-vacation to France and I feel like I got back a little joie de vivre. There was a bit of a wait to get my order but the folks took my coffee order while I was in line and I got to start savouring before I put in my pastry order so props for being mindful of the customers and doing their best to look after us. Since the beignets are made to order, it is worth the wait....trust me.

They also have some tasty looking gelato and their cooler already had some deli foods like olives and cheese (I need to come back soon to pick up some parmesan). I can only imagine what awesome goodies they're going to have. Once they get their liquor license we can look forward to French wine and craft beer for sale. They also have fresh flowers for sale. How awesome will you be when you bring home some fresh flowers and a bottle of wine and some cheese? Oui, oui!

The inside is very pleasant and has a nice European feel  with white walls and French Country dcor. I had a chance to chat with the owner's wife and they are really great people so this is a great new business that is well worth patronizing. I think it is a great concept and am so happy that we have this in Phoenix. It is dangerously close to where I live so I could very soon turn into a beignet whore-consider yourself warned!

Parking is a bit of an issue and after going around the block twice I had to park across the street and walk in the 115 degree heat....but it was worth it. I do hope that they find reason to open earlier during the week in the future because I would be in for coffee every day on the way to work.

Really great place run by good people. Well worth checking out and I can't wait to see how much more I love them when they are completely up and running!

kabuto review #2
I rarely revisit the same restaurant within a week....but this place deserved another visit and I'm already planning to go back yet again next week.  I think I'm becoming a Kabuto-addict as many are going to be if you have been yearning for an authentic edomae style sushi.

They started an Omakase menu today, so I gave that a try.  

The difference between Omakase and Nigiri course is that they include miso soup as well as sashimi plate that included blue fine tuna, houbou (blue fin robbin), and kasuga dai (baby sea bream) as well as grilled plate, in which today they had Kamasu (barracuda? sort of), australian wagyu, and anago (salt water eel) with sansho spice with anago liver.  It did come with pinapple flavored sake aperitif as well as today's sakizuke (amuse bouche) was grilled kasugodai (baby sea bream) and wakame salad.  

Nigiri started out with Kinme (golden eye snapper or alfonsino), blue fine tuna, kanpachi (amberjack), kisu (sand whiting), surume ika (squid), ishidai (striped beakperch), blue fin tuna chutoro, then negitoro hand roll.  I also ordered hotate (scallops) and aoyagi (orange clam) a la carte.  In Omakase, it doesn't come with tamago (eggs) which nigiri course comes with.  

I believe that most fish came from Japan again, except for clams (hotate, orange clam from boston), amberjack from kona, HI, and Tuna from Spain again.  They only received 3 Kisu from which they can only make 2 sushi from each fish, so that was pretty nice for itamae-san to save it for me, as kisu as a sushi ingredient is not very common even in Japan as it's a tricky fish to prepare.  It's used a lot in Tempura.  

I feel that Omakase is great for those people who want to drink some sake beforehand and eat some sashimi and grilled fish before starting Nigiri.  If you are a straight nigiri kind of person then I'd probably stick with nigiri course.  

I just can't say enough good things about this place or hide my excitement.  I love the fact that most of the fish is different from week to week as they get different fish as REAL sushiya does instead of having the same old same old frozen/defrosted fish.  

Several words of advice for the edomae sushi noobs:
  1)  don't ask for soy sauce. You don't need it unless you have sashimi or hand roll and the wait staff will bring it to you as it becomes necessary.  Besides, they use a special soy sauce that's aged 3 years, so they certainly don't want to leave a big container for people to pour out liberally.  Don't ask for extra wasabi as there is no need for it. Putting wasabi in soy sauce is a huge no-no as it destroys the flagrance.  

  2)  Try to use your fingers, not chopsticks.  If the itamae sees that you are using a chopstick then he will probably make the nigiri a little firmer so that it doesn't fall apart, but nigiri needs to be soft enough with enough air in the rice portion so that it falls apart as you put it in your mouth.  The proper way is to pick it up with your fingers (thumb/index, middle finger), then rotate it and put it on your tongue with fish part facing down toward your tongue.  In most sushi places you may need to dip the fish part (NOT rice) in soy sauce, therefore nigiri needs to be inverted anyway, but in a proper place like Kabuto, soy sauce is already painted on so it's not necessary to dip in soy sauce.  You want to put the fish down first so that you can feel the texture of the fish, and you do NOT want to put the rice on the tongue first because vinegared sushi rice is too strong of a flavor for you to enjoy each fish's texture/flagrance/taste. 

3)  Do not insult the itamae by ordering NON edomae neta (sushi ingredient) such as salmon, unagi, or any silly sounding rolls because they won't have any of that.  Instead, ask the itamae for some edomae neta, which are not commonly seen in the U.S., which are things like anago, kohada (shad), nihama (cooked clam), saba (mackerel), etc.  Can you tell what they have in common??  Yes, they are all cooked or vinegared.  In Japanese, we call them sushi netas that have some "work" done to them.  It takes more skill/time/experience to make them as opposed to just cutting raw fish, but those are the classic edomae neta's that separate the real sushi ya's from the wannabes.

4)  As it is still BYOB, try to go out and get yourself some real sake to go with your sushi.  A good sake will go VERY WELL with sushi, especially properly vinegared sushi rice. If you don't like sake, you probably haven't had a good one.  Go to place like total wine and look for a JYUNMAI sake, meaning pure rice sake.  It is sad to admit that the Japanese sake industry has been corrupt for decades, and big companies like shochikubai and ozeki have been making crap sake with additives for decades.  You want to get jyunmai sake that is made of rice and water, nothing else.  Or even better, GINJYO or Daiginjyo are premium sake made from shaved down rice only using the central part, which has more of a fruity aroma.

===================
I've never had any desire to be here. I actually had no idea it was a place to be. I didn't even know where it was to be honest... I had just heard about it... just that it existed by name. Nothing more. Had I seen the reviews here before going, I might not have even bothered. 

A friend of mine was working the whole Fashion Week thing and somehow scored us these amazing $400 all-access VIP Super Passes to the whole thing including the after party held at the W. 

The downtown area was a traffic congestion nightmare so it took awhile to get a place to park. They were holding a red velvet rope line show at the main entrance to the hotel where all the cars pull up. So elegant and fancy. We waited outside amidst the fumes and fancy rides for our turn to enter with our super passes for what seemed like forever. 

Alas, it was not meant to be as the guy at the door (read: giant useless turd in a suit) finally told my lady friend that he can only let girls in that don't have guys with them... and apparently only if they pass a certain age, boob job, slutty dress set of standards that only exist in this guy's head. Some guys were getting in, but only models from the show pretty much. 

I tried to convince my friend to just leave so we could go someplace I actually like, but she was wanting to prove a point on principal. She confronted him a few times about his being a soulless anus, but he didn't wouldn't change his position about us. 

I should've stepped in and said "look - we've been standing here long enough - either let us the hell in or tell us we aren't welcome here even with our $400 all-access VIP super passes so we can fuck off to someplace better where we don't have to look at your shitty face, you hack." 

In the end our time was wasted. Elitism won and we finally gave up since there was only an hour left of the night and the line had dwindled to only a few dozen people unfit to enter the exclusive party. My friend was too upset to salvage the energy to go to another place. She actually was over the whole Scottsdale thing and insisted that this was representative of the whole city - I was unable to assure her it wasn't (but I assure you it isn't). We hugged a sad goodnight right there in the W carport and went our separate ways. 

It's easy to say I didn't really want to be in there in the first place - well, I really didn't. I was just interested in having a drink with a friend and catching up. The W just wasn't meant to be the venue to host such an event. 

I never got to see the inside from the inside, but I'm pretty sure it smelled like shit covered in puke in there and was likely covered in some sort of sticky film that only drips off of the most hoity of toity. It's not that I'm jealous because I was already hanging out with all these same fake assholes at Fashion Week an hour earlier - I don't know that a change of scenery would really make them that much more compelling and interesting. In fact, I'm sure it wouldn't. It's just that I don't like places that judge you worthy or unworthy of coming in. It's demoralizing and insulting. Even if they had let us in, I would've felt the same way. 

Pretentiousness is next to ugliness. 

If I had actually paid $400 for that VIP Super Pass and not been let in to the party immediately, I'd be pretty livid. Since it was free, I can't be that mad - but the rope guy didn't know I got the passes for free. We were dressed nice and we're all fairly attractive people. Maybe I'm too old or too fat or didn't have on an Ed Hardly or Affraction shirt. Maybe this dude just didn't like the cut of my jib. No telling why for sure, but I certainly wouldn't have waited more than 5 minutes if it wasn't for my friend wanting to get in. It's just not something I do. 

So I didn't get to see the inside of this place from the inside - just the car port with the parade of Escalades, sports cars and exhaust fumes. I'm sure it's pretty nice in there, but the only thing I'm willing to wait in line for that long is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm pretty sure there's nothing nearly as great inside this shallow pit of pseudo cool as fucking Space Mountain. 

Blow me, W... you $#&@

HOTTEST WAITER IN CENPHO ALERT!  I went tonight with Tony A for my first (finally!) visit to St. Francis.  I had first heard about it from Sunny B. and couldn't find it for a week after I read her review.  Duh!   It's right next to my bank!  When Tony suggested we go, I jumped right on that bandwagon!
We had about a 15 minute wait.  The place looked packed, so 15 minutes was fine.  We sat outside and chatted for a bit.  We even talked about how cool it would be if we could sit upstairs.  Guess what?  WE WERE SEATED UPSTAIRS!!   Que milagro!
Our waiter.  *sigh*  I shall hereforth refer to him as Dreamboat Brandon.  (spell check says "hereforth" isn't a word.  Is it???)  First of all, anyone who can deal with Tony and I together get major kudos.  We can be...raunchy brats when together.  Dreamboat Brandon rode the wave.  Great service on keeping our drinks filled and not hovering, even though the both of us would have loved that!
I had the ahi sandwich, based on other reviews.  YUMMY!  It came with avocado and tomatoes and what I *think* was a horseradish mayo.  There was a little cup of homemade potato chips on the side.  Nice, thick (no, I'm not talking about Dreamboat Brandon!) steak of ahi on a thick Kasier-type roll.  
The Arnold Palmer was made with mango iced tea, which was totally perfect with my meal.
I love the decor!  Tony said I *had* to check out the bathroom.  Good thing I had to pee.  I couldn't figure out how to open the door to the WOMEN'S restroom and then it opened from inside...by a guy.  He said he couldn't wait.  I gave him the lecture on how WE have to wait in line at concerts and footballs games.  AND he had left the seat up.  Anyway, the bathroom was really funky.  There's even a safe in the wall, which I tried, while peeing, to open.  To no avail.  
All of the staff was friendly and it was just a really cool atmosphere.  It's definitely a place CenPho needed.  I have never seen it empty, even on weeknights.  I am glad that it's so close to home.  I am also glad that they seem to be doing pretty well.  I would hate to see Dreamboat Brandon without a job.  Of course, I do need an assistant...

My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said "yes" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.

Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all "eff it, we're starving, let's eat".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  

We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:

Chef: Did you just get married?
Us: No.  It's been over 6 years.
Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.

(a few minutes later)

Chef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?
Wife: No it's not.
Chef: Well why else would he take you here?

HAHA

(later)

Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.
Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!

So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called "The Shit".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  

Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?

I liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.  Lots of reviewers have raved about the fish to rice ratio and it's great.  I would nigiri my way to fullness if we ever came here again.

I like this place so much I'm selling it to the Yelp world for free. Cromwell and Victor Drai, you're welcome. If you are hitting Vegas with a group of girls and no guys, this is DEFINITELY the club to pick. Drai's is exceptionally girl-friendly, even for Vegas. If you are going with just girls, send me a Yelp message, and I'll send the number for Mike, the super awesome promoter that got me and a female friend in for free last night. 

NOTE: Please remember that clubs care about image... Facts- you should be dressed very well and are expected to be decently attractive and look 30 or under if you want to get in with a promoter.

Since it was slow at 10:30, they gave a whole bunch of groups of girls a table and free champagne until the table was sold later on. Such an awesome perk, especially since you know every girl is wearing painful, hot-looking shoes. I've been to XS, Hakkasan, Haze, Marquee, and LiFE, and gotten free drink tickets, but I've only seen this extra mile at Drai's, and I've seen it more than once. (No promises on a table, but they will take care of you if possible.)

The club design maximizes room for people that didn't get a table, so you have plenty of room to move around and dance still. Unlike Hakkasan. The energy is fantastic here because it's an open space. Be prepared to wait for a drink, though, likely from a pissed off-looking bartender.

If you got a table, there is plenty of room to dance, and service has always been fantastic. Even the bouncers were so incredibly nice to my friend and I. Just don't be #basic by taking your shoes off. Get you some Dr Scholls and go to Drai's.  :)

The effects are so bomb with lasers, lights, cold air, and massive screens lining the roof and ceiling. 

Of note- music mixes hip hop, Top 40, and EDM, depending what day and time it is. I was here twice this week, and on Thursday it was all hip hop. Not a fan. If you like EDM like me, I would check the Vegas EDM calendar for Thursdays.

Saturday around 11PM was all vocal EDM before switching to the guest DJ. Their only downfall is that Drai's don't have a resident DJ with a huge name, so you don't really know what you are going to get unless they have a headliner that week, and they seem to be lining up famous DJs now.
Sundays, I believe, are hip-hoppish as well. (XS is perfect for Sundays with good crowds, by the way.... You're welcome, too, XS!)

After we left Drai's, the guys at the door even asked us if we wanted to go to Drai's After Hours for free. Definitely the place to be if you are all girls. It's a really, really fun club, and you will never have trouble finding the bathroom here either like in other clubs. :)

With the sudden and sad departure of SHIN Yakitori House in the Spring Valley area, Kyara comes as a welcome addition in this neighborhood.

Call it a cross between Ichiza and Raku, this town has plenty of room for another izakaya type of establishment and many hungry customers waiting in the wings.

Kyara is located in an unassuming and relatively quiet area along Jones and Sunset next to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  The mood is set when you enter what feels like a upscale restaurant.  Chaos is not what this place is about.

There are plenty of counter seats where you can watch the kitchen in action, but with the Baby in tow, we sat at a table. The restaurant is set up in sections making private parties a great possibility.

Once we were seated, there was a slight lapse where we thought we had been forgotten. Instead, they were deep frying a fresh taste of their mountain potato to get your taste buds working.

The menu is easily broken up with their daily specials being the star. It's very much a revolving menu as items available two months ago aren't offered now.

Our dinner items:

* Deep fried Yamaimo - This mountain potato was lightly fried with a sprinkling of furikake.  The delicate flavor surprisingly impressed us and had us wanting more of this complimentary offering.  As someone asked, was it gooey...and not at all!

* Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad ($7.50) - Five slices of salmon along with greens makes this a tasty dish.  Assembled quite simply but satisfyingly.

* Albacore Jalapeno ($7.50) - Seven slices of albacore that had a sauce that we enjoyed.

* Spicy Tuna Dip ($5) - A generous ball of spicy tuna alongside crispy rice crackers.  We spread the tuna onto the cracker and enjoyed the crunch along with the spice.

* Agedashi Tofu ($4.30) - Good, but not quite my favorite although I still enjoyed it.

* Negi Ma ($1.90) - The chicken and green onion we chose to have sauce on it, our mistake.  Skip the sauce next time.

* Enoki Bacon ($2.30) - Anything wrapped in bacon tastes good!

* Kawa ($2.20) - Grilled chicken skin...a dash of salt and togorashi is all you need.

* Butabara ($2.20) The pork belly was a rather disappointing since it was dried out and not fatty enough for me. 

* Daikon Salad ($4.20) - I'm not usually a fan of daikon salad but the simple additions to their version makes it a nice and subtle dish.

* Gyutan ($5.50) - The beef tongue was good, but not as tender as I would have hoped.

* Kaisen Chawanmushi ($5) - Their version of a steamed custard was the real winner of the night.  It was super super smooth and luxurious and probably among the best chawanmushis I have ever experienced.  It also came with a decent amount of seafood inside and the Husband and I were both thoroughly impressed.  Worth getting your own and not sharing.

* Koro Steak ($9.50) - We were told it was quite tender and that is the very truth.  We both loved the steak, but could have done without the beansprouts...something else would have been better.

* Soft Shell Crab Appetizer ($5.80) - My only real complaint was that it lacked something...a dipping sauce of maybe ponzu, tempura sauce, or Japanese mayo would have been nice.  But then again, maybe that's how I usually get it elsewhere and that's how I'm used to having it.

* Tofu Mousse ($4.80) "Homemade Vanilla Tofu Mousse" - We're all about homemade tofu and definitely wanted to try their sweet version.  It was accompanied by a raspberry(?) sorbet-like granita that could have been broken down a bit more.  It arrived in chunks that made it   difficult to get into with the wooden spoons provided.  Nonetheless, we still enjoyed this sweet ending to our dinner.  

Overall, it was a lovely Mother's Day dinner.  Service was polite and what you would expect from a real Japanese restaurant.  We were impressed by the number of Japanese diners there along with the families as well.  It brings a different ambiance and we liked it.  There are a few things that are a bit more costly than what I'd expect, so be prepared.  We'll be going back again to see what other specials come up!

* * Update! We returned on 06.24.  Additional items we tried included:

* Beef Tataki ($9.50) - 

* Homemade Tofu ($4.80) - We love the simplicity of homemade tofu.  Here it is accompanied with wasabi, bonito shavings, finely grated ginger, and scallions.

* Tofu Miso Kushi ($1.50) - Three pieces on a skewer, grilled with some miso sauce.  Simple and tasty.

* Wakasagi Age "Deep Fried Surf Smelt" ($4.50) 

* Ayu Shio Yaki "Grilled seasonal sweet fish from Japan" ($9.50) 

* Hirame Carpaccio "Halibut - South Korea" ($6.50)

* Gyu Shabu Salad "Sliced Beef & Spinach" ($6.50)

* Chocolate Fondant "Homemade Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream" ($6.50)

We were offered a different complimentary taster, but we craved the deep fried yamaimo.  They were nice enough to fry us up a batch!  Love it! Dessert was free because it was the Husband's birthday! 

4.5 stars from 4 stars!

When we first arrived to drop off our puppy (she is almost 6 months old) we were greeted at the front desk by a woman who seemed a bit scattered.  This is understandable because it was on a Friday and shortly after we entered a line of other dog-parents stacked up behind us.  I came prepared, we gave the facility two sheets of paper nicely typed with instructions on how to feed our pooch, her personality, what she likes, what she doesn't like, etc.  No one asked us anything about the dog. They only wanted us to fill out paperwork that asked if she had been to a dog park before and provide them with permission to treat her in case of an emergency and of course, her shot records.  We have used many boarding facilities in the past and I have actually even worked at one for a brief time so we are very accustomed to normal functions at these facilities. 

As I was standing in line signing consent forms, a man took my dog without even letting me say goodbye to her.  I asked if I could see the room she would be staying in and was promptly told "No".  They then pointed to the television and said she would be staying in a room that would be available to view by webcam.  I asked, "What room will she be in?".  They told me they didn't know.  I handed the lady my paperwork and she told us to have a great trip.  I waited a few seconds before asking her if she needed my dog's food bag, blanket, and toys that was sitting on the ground in front of me.  I would assume since she was staying 2 nights that they were hoping to feed her during her stay.  It was very strange that I had to remind them to TAKE the food and her medicine.  Typically boarding facilities go over feeding instructions to ensure that they will be doing things correctly.  This is especially true when a dog is on medication or has a strict diet.  This wasn't the case for Just Like Home.  No one really cared.  But I did point to the typed out sheet of paper before we were ushered out and told them that ALL OF HER FEEDING instructions were on the paper and that she had to follow her diet.  They took her bag and started checking in the next dog. My fiance and myself walked slowly to our car very hesitant to leave our dog behind.  

3 hours after we left I decided to follow the instructions to log in via my phone to see the live video feed.  I couldn't find my dog.  We watched for 30 minutes and she was nowhere to be seen.  We pulled over our car and called the establishment and asked them which room she was staying in.  Again we were told "I don't know".  We asked how we could view our puppy if they didn't know where she would be at and then they said that she was probably just being fed.  The next day we logged on to see our dog in the morning and were unable for over an hour to see her.  At one point we almost thought that the videos were untruthful because our dog was never seen.  Her blanket and toys that we brought were never seen at all during her stay in any of the rooms.  (We still do not know what room she stayed in and highly doubt if the facility staff know either!)


 It wasn't until the morning we were returning to pick her up that we finally caught a glimpse of her outside.  She was laying down in the sun.  That helped us breathe easier.  But with at least ten other dogs around her it was very strange that we saw no person in the yard with the dogs.  This is dangerous if a dog fight would have broken out.  Dogs need to be supervised in groups at all times to ensure their safety.  When we finally got to boarding facility, we were greeted at the front desk again and told that our dog had a great time.  They constantly referred our female dog as a male.  Even in her write up report she was called a HE over and over.  This reinforces our suspicion that they have no idea what they're doing with these animals.  They don't even know the gender (or care to look at the paperwork to see what it is) of the dogs in their care.  When my dog finally came out, her head was hanging very low.  She was put right into my arms, and she didn't recognize me at all.  Her head just hung low, very sad.  It wasn't until I turned around when she caught the scent of my fiance and "woke up".  Her entire underside was very wet and she smelled very bad like urine.  This was surprising because she is a very clean dog and had just been fully groomed and bathed the night before she came to Just Like Home. I had to remind the staff that she should still have food left over to bring home.  All of her food was labeled so that they could know exactly what day and when to give her each portion.  When they finally found her food we noticed there was an odd amount left of it. They were feeding her wrong.  We also noticed that her blanket and toys never left the bag we gave them.  We also had to get her groomed right after leaving the facility because she smelled so awful.  
There was just problem after problem. Needless to say, we will never come back.

I had this place on my radar, so when fellow yelper, Loon E. and his girl were in town and suggested this place, I was all in! Walking inside it seemed dark, but I liked it. We chose a table and menus and waters were quickly brought to us. Loon had a beer I tasted that was supposed to be ginger flavored, but the ginger taste was very faint. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide what to order because it all looks so good. 

The menu consists of signature, premium and vegetarian pasties, soups, salads, desserts and an interesting variety of appetizers. To start I ordered "Oven Chips" priced at $3.50 plus an additional 50 cents for cheese I wanted on them. The chips are hand cut British style and baked in the oven with cracked pepper and sea salt. I thought the chips were a bit on the soggy side. I wondered if it was because of the addition of cheese that made them soggy, but after tasting the oven chips with jalapeno and no cheese that the others at my table were sharing, they too were mushy and soggy to me.

I ordered a "Carne Adovada" pasty priced at $9.50 and WOW! After the first bite, my taste buds were dancing with joy! This pasty has simmered pork in a New Mexican red chili stew, rice, chilies and cheddar. It also comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. There is so much great flavor going on in this pasty! I honestly never even tried the salsa that accompanied it because the pasty itself has such good flavor on it's own, but I did really enjoy it with the sour cream. I must come back and eat this again! I sampled some of the "Bangers and Mash" pasty and thought the first bite was okay, but the next was a bit blah. The red wine gravy that came with it was too salty. I have to say that it isn't something I have ever had before, so I truly can't compare it to another, but the flavor wasn't for me.

Our server was just great! I wish I could remember her name to give her a proper shout-out, but I can tell you aside from being an awesome waitress, she knows all about Emoji and how everybody needs a little in their life! ;)

If you wanted they have an option to take a part-baked pasty home to bake when you are ready to eat it. The part-baked pasties are sold at a reduced price, but they make a certain amount fresh throughout the day, so I would recommend calling your order in to make sure they can have the pasty you want ready to take home. I want to come back at some point to try out some of their other sides and try baking a pasty at home to see how it turns out. With the variety of pasties here, if a certain one doesn't work for you flavor-wise, give another one a try! Maybe you will find a favorite like I did!

I don't go out much or get to.. to say the least, but Sage.. saved me from every aspect of isolation of a homebody. Nestled in Aria Hotel, on the casino level by the front desk, adjacent from Julian Serrano. The array of deep, neon hues of purple awaits as you walk by the bar and into the main dining room. Three words to describe the ambiance: Sultry, sexy, and sooooothing. The bar and lounge area is quite inviting. I wouldn't mind at all having my meal there. 

My classy date and I were greeted by a kind, smiling lovely hostess named Alexis. I appreciate that so much, since the warm welcoming gives a great start to a wonderful dining experience.  We were then escorted in by the assistant manager and even pulled out the table and chair for us. My Oh my it just gets better and better!!! 

This was my first time trying a Signature Tasting Menu and honestly, I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be able to share this experience with someone that loves great creations of food as much as I do. *Sigh I'm so happy... We tasted everything, shared everything, and that in itself meant Everything to me. 

The 1st Course: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE 
w/ Pickled Mustard Seeds. Crushed Caper Aioli , Slow Poached Egg, & Crispy Chocolate  -Extraordinary. By far the best beef tartare I ever had. The presentation itself was breathtaking and simply a work of art. Once you mix the egg with beef, the texture is ever so creamy. After my first bite, combining everything even the piece of thin, airy chocolate on top of a tasty olive oil infused, crispy brioche toast. I was singing.. Isn't she lovely... yeeeeees. All the ingredients, solid flavors were bursting with surprise in my mouth. It's nothing like I ever tasted before. If this is how it feels when you fall in love... I'm deeply in love.

We also went all out and substituted for yes..... the FOIE GRAS BRULEE!!! The soft, slightly salty brioche muffin contrast with the richness of the foie gras.. make whoopie by eating this. A very sensual dish. This hypnotizing flavor is all new to me..  dizzy in love again.. perhaps that was the champagne?! Reggie, our sommelier was informative and great. 

The 2nd Course: BACON- WRAPPED RABBIT      
English Pea Ravioli/Nueske Bacon, & Sweet Onion Sauce - Vibrant green colors.. gave away this freshness to the eyes. Beautiful dish. Every single element in this entree were magically paired to one another. It was as if you were eating your favorite song. Rabbit.. oh Rabbit.. I love you... Damn it.. I do. *hitting the dining table with my fists... gawd I want more and more of you. Addicted..

MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS 
Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms, & Salted Caramel Reduction -My favorite seafood.. Scallops! Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and oh so damn succulent. Forget day dreaming.. I fantasize about this dish. Can't get enough of it. I want this dish and I want it Bad. Delicious!

The 3rd Course:  We both ordered... 48 HOUR BEEF BELLY  
Shaved Purple Asparagus/Ramp-Sorrel Puree, & Pickled Ramps/Toasted Almond - Very rich and the depth of flavor is endless. Extremely tender and effortlessly melts in your mouth. This isn't for the faint of heart, but for a heart of gold due to the luxuriance of the meat. Happily satisfied :)

The 4th course: GIANDUJA PAVE 
Olive Oil Ice Cream, Hazelnut Crunch, & Basil Jam -Odd combination, but it was the best ending to such an amazing, memorable dinner. Again, everything I tasted was like a stimulating, new fairy tale story. It made such a profound impact of how I felt at that present moment and I could say... I could have fallin' in love. I never knew food could alter the way I feel and gosh darn it... I felt So beyond special. I never smiled so bright. My tummy was beaming! 

We were also offered complimentary breads in the beginning of sourdough or bacon bread. Bacon, by far was it for me and the whipped, creamy butter with sea salt .. yes another smile on this face. *sigh We also did the wine pairing with our Tasting :) I could cry out of joy from this experience. Pure bliss... Maybe since the flavors and simple ingredients were like traveling and exploring a new country.. a first for me. I was just stunned and even turned on by how delicious this restaurant was. The dim, cozy decor, and colors makes this ideal for a perfect Romantic date. I seriously couldn't be more pleased and happy. I love the fact my date has great taste in food and loves exploring as much as eating. Great company and great food can definitely lead to great things ;) The service was exceptional, top notch, 5 solid stars... The GM, Robert was ever so personable, funny, and kind by checking up on us throughout our evening. Our servers, runners, bussers, all worked smoothly together and made this one of the best dining experience I ever had in my entire life. Thank you. That being said.. This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I can't wait to go back.

I always make a point to inquire as to what people do for Christmas dinner. This is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures, when in reality I'm just looking for a scapegoat. 

Just once, when someone screams "YOU EAT CHEF BOYARDEE FOR CHRISTMAS!?" at me, I'd like to be able to say "oh yeah...well [insert your name] eats [insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce]!"

For like, a long time, my family have made hand-made ravioli for Christmas. It's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a Sunday afternoon. So naturally that's when I decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from Tammie Coe.

We're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when I call to see when they close. 

The ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish. 

And guess how much longer Tammie Coe was open? That's right, 2-3 hours.

The smell of dough still fresh on my threads, Misty S and I jetted (or should I say "jetta'd"...fuck you) to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food. 

Now, I had been to Tammie Coe quite a few times,  usually in tow with Amanda B. Since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup, I usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats. I simply sip on a peach tea and pretend I'm not starving for some fucking cake.

But there we were, on a Sunday morning, dressed in our pajamas, having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making.

Misty S said looking at all the food made her hungry.

Well, yeah.

Saying that Tammie Coe doesn't make you hungry is like saying Bandaids doesn't bring you deep, deep shame.

So along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders, a peach tea, iced chai, and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies I like to call "diabetes frisbees".

The sliders were all kinds of delicious. Even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so. And considering the prices at other places in the area, you're not going to beat a $2 sandwich. Unless you rob the place.

Would a yelp review count as evidence in court? 

"Your honor, I present to you Exhibit Y, where the defendant  writes 'and as I walked out of the restaurant, money in hand, the cowering hostess muttered to me 'thank you for coming, have a nice day'. Three stars for outstanding hospitality." 

The peach tea was, as expected, great. I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is. The few sips I had of Misty's iced chai latte were above and beyond Starbucks quality. 

But then again, what isn't?

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

Ok, let me start off by saying I have shopped here a few times and found some great deals, and for the shopping experience I would give probably 4 stars. I decided it was time to clean out my closet, and thought it would be a good idea to try to sell some of my stuff to NBE and make a little cash. I gathered a bag of goodies (all being name brand items from Buckle, AE, Hollister, and others) and headed to NBE with about 8 or 9 pairs of jeans, 6 or 7 pairs of shorts, 5 or 6 skirts, a couple shirts, and two purses - a (real) Coach handbag and a Betsey Johnson bag which still had the the $62 tag attached. I was told when I walked in to neatly lay out my items on the buying table, and that I could either have a seat or take a look around while I waited. When she called me back to the front, the girl at the counter said there were 6 items they wanted to buy from me. I asked which items they decided to take, and she told me they would take my coach purse, my Sinful jeans, and a few pairs of my shorts. She also informed me that since it was nearing the end of summer, they had to price the shorts at the stock rate so they would give me a little less for them. I was offered $21 and some change in cash or $30 something in store credit. This was a disappointing number considering I had hoped for $50-75. Anyway,  There were a few people waiting behind me in line, so I quickly did a little math in my head and figured about $7-10 for the Coach, $7-10 for the Sinful jeans, and about $2 each for the shorts, since she had said they weren't worth as much this time of year. Trying not to hold up the line, I opted for cash, (even though I felt like the Coach and the Sinful jeans were worth at least $20 each, not to mention the practically brand new Hollister shorts I basically gave away), I quickly signed the form placed in front of me, and gathered my unwanted items from the shelf where they put the duds. I left the store and thought I'd try another clothing exchange store for the rest of my stuff before taking it all to Goodwill. When I got to the other store,  I discovered to my surprise that my Betsey Johnson purse was not in my bag of goodies.  After I finished the other store, I went back to NBE. I told the girl at the desk that I wasn't aware that they took both purses, and that she had only mentioned the Coach. Both of the girls working looked at me like I was crazy, and the girl I had dealt with earlier lied to defend herself and said that she had told me that they were taking both the Betsey Johnson and the Coach. I politely explained to them that I would not have taken that little of cash for both purses plus the jeans. (Again, basically gave away some Hollister shorts). I politely asked if there was any way I could give them back the money and take back my items, or at least the Betsey, because I felt like I had been ripped off. They said there was nothing they could do, all cash trades are final, and the only way I could get my purse back was to buy it for what they priced it for. I asked how much they priced it for and they told me $18, which is only $3 short of what they gave me for all the stuff they got. So basically they figuratively "bought" my items for approximately the following prices: around $5 for the brand new Betsey (original price tag ATTACHED said $62), around $5 for the Sinful jeans, (which cost around $125 new, worth I'd say at least around $50 gently used), around $5 for the Coach, (which cost $129 new on sale at the outlet, worth at least $50 gently used), and about $5 for the "few pairs of shorts" which probably were worth around $10 each. This amount of money is no where close to $40% of retail, which they supposedly pay customers for items. Given the fact that they priced the Betsey for $18, 40%=$7.20, I know they ripped me off. I was uncomfortable selling even the Coach and the Sinful jeans for that little, but I could live with it. However, I am FURIOUS that they snagged BOTH my purses plus everything else for so little!! I would NOT have accepted this awful deal!!! And I think it's ridiculous that they not only wouldn't allow me to give them their money back in exchange my items, but they wouldn't even attempt to make any sort of fair agreement with me, especially since it was only about an hour prior that I was in there the first time!  Not to mention they wouldn't admit that they dishonestly took the Betsey without my knowing! They said I could speak to the manager but she wouldn't be there until tomorrow.  I will definitely be giving her a call, there is NO WAY I will sell anything to them again, and I will think twice before shopping there again!! No better than THIEVES!!! RIPOFF ALERT!!!

BURNED

This end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices. You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from "The Daily Show" thinks is the best pizza in the world. At the end of the day, real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city. I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza. When I'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it's cheap, fast and I'm hungry. 

So here I am in Las Vegas and not New York. I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street. I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven. It was in the oven for rather a long time. I really wasn't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it. 

I finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it. The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level. The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I couldn't get it off in time. All I could think was why didn't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like, "Hey be careful because it's really hot!" I didn't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it. A warning or something would have been a nice gesture. I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry. 

I ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth. Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast. I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days. It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas. 

I really wouldn't recommend  this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix. Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here. I really wished I would have just walked by this location. The pizza wasn't that great just like New York City. If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza, then they nailed it. My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.

On a side note there are a ton of costumed characters hanging around nearby selling photo opps. It is kind of like a freak show of costumed crazies. These characters are in no way associated with this pizza place but you are going to have to go through this mess to get here. Enjoy!

Okay, one of the best steak houses I've eaten at!  

I spent New Year's in Las Vegas and this was one of the places we went for dinner.  We were also seeing the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One after dinner so being in a slight rush, we were hoping they would be able to get our food out in time because we had to be seated by 6:45 pm at the Mandalay Resort.  Once we told them this, the serving staff were all very accommodating and stressed that they would put a rush on things.  

I made a reservation through Open Table for 5:00 and they happen to open right at 5:00. Since we got there a little earlier so as not to miss our show, we had a few minutes wait before they could seat us so we waited at the bar. I ordered a VIP Martini which is their signature drink. Very refreshing indeed!

We were finally seated and my friend and I each ordered the Prime Strip which was 16 ounces (1 lb.) of delicious aged beef.  We were first served some great bread and butter.  I also had the Bleu Cheese Wedge Salad which was really nice, big and filling.  Along with the steak, we ordered sides of the sauteed mushrooms and asparagus with almonds.  Both were really delicious but I couldn't eat very much of it because I was getting really full from the steak which I was intent on finishing.  It was my main goal since I didn't want it to go waste and the besides the fact that it tasted so darn good, so tender with the right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection, scrumptious!!  We asked the server how they prepared it and she told us so now I can hopefully replicate it at home sometime.  It'll probably won't be the same however because it never is when you try to do it at home.

I enjoyed the dinner immensely do I will definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas when I want a  steak because they do it up right here.  They have a nice decor with dark woods making the ambiance really comfortable and inviting.

If you're looking for a good steak house, I highly recommend coming to Del Frisco's because you won't be disappointed in the food or service.

Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  

Shocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about "keeping it real" just from these itty bitty green things.

My wife was ready to order "bakudan" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  

I didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  

I also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      

Their chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  

Chicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)

Some stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  

None of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!

"I've never really wanted to go to Japan. Simply because I don't like eating fish. And I know that's very popular out there in Africa."  Britney Spears

Strutted into DOZO on Friday night and walked away content.  Although my actual rating is probably closer to 3.5 stars, I think they're definitely more worthy of 4 stars than 3.  Here are the details:

I ran across this Yelp listing by an off-chance and saw that they offered izakaya/yakitori.  What!?  Is this really in Tempe or am I accidentally looking at a Los Angeles listing?  The outside of the restaurant even has red lanterns like real izakaya joints!  Wee!  After a few weeks of pining, I came here with skewers of yumminess in mind.  We ordered everything I was hankering for:  Chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken livers, beef tongue, chicken cartridge, atka mackeral, fried sweet shrimp, takoyaki, and a pork bento on the side just in case the small bites were really small.

The offal [tongue, heart, gizzard, and livers] were all over-cooked.  I think this is so because the cooks were afraid of serving customers under-cooked meat.  I had been watching the chef the whole time and never once did he leave his grill so I do think it was intentional.  Working in the food industry, I know the pain of customers thinking the chicken could be too raw and not safe for consumption so let's burn the heck outta it.  Next time though, I would ask them to not cook it so well.  The cartridge seemed to be really crunchy things and I'm not too sure if actual cartridge was used but it made for an interesting texture after eating so much rubbery offal.  Skip the salted smoked fish --- nothing special [save yourself $11, folks].  The bento is ridiculously huge with lots of sides but you get a tiny pork cutlet and some not-too-cute tuna rolls with it.  The fried sweet shrimp and takoyaki with bonito flakes were probably my favorite bites of the night.  It was fun playing with the giant shrimps and the takoyaki had generous large pieces of octopus inside.  Yum!

While the service could be better with hiring another waitress/hostess and the wait time for food seems pretty long considering they're "small bites" with at least three cooks present, I would definitely be back --- I want to try the ramen.  Everyone here is really nice.  Yes, the owners and staff all speak Mandarin but hey, we're in America folks.  Koreans are making sushi so why can't the Chinese make izakaya?  America is great because we're a melting pot of cultures.  Stop complaining, people!  Why make this a scandal?

Dinner for two came out to be $56 [without tip].  Not bad, DOZO.  Not bad at all.

The place we originally met a friend at had too long of a wait to be seated, so I suggested we give Mark Rich's New York Pizza & Pasta a try since it was in the same shopping center and we hadn't been there before. Italian sounded good to us all so we headed over. Walking in we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Our server, Ellen, introduced herself right away and took our drink orders. 

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $2.99 for 6. These aren't really garlic knots, but garlicky pull-apart dinner rolls. They were very good! I wouldn't recommend them though if you don't like a lot of garlic because there is not only garlic on the top, but covered on the bottom as well. Hubby and I enjoyed them a lot however our friend found it too overpowering. More for us! The side of sauce that accompanied the knots was decent, but bland. 

So they had a special going on where 2 can dine for $25 and my friend and I decided to go for that. The deal lets you pick 1 soup or salad, 1 pasta each and 1 dessert to share. I chose the "Italian Wedding Soup" to start and couldn't have been more pleased. The soup had plenty of flavor and even came with a side of garlic bread. For my main meal I had the "Baked Manicotti" and I have to be honest, I wasn't that pleased with this dish. The cheese on top seemed overcooked and when I went to cut into my manicotti, the cheese came all off. I just set it aside and didn't eat it. The dish was drowning in bland sauce. I ate half of it and it wasn't bad, it just didn't have much flavor. The manicotti also came with more garlic bread. I just feel it coming with the soup and the pasta was a bit much. For dessert it was "New York Cheese Cake" and that went home with my friend so I don't know how it tasted, but I heard back the next day from him that it was very good! Hubby had the "Italian Sub" priced at $6.99 and he loved it. I tried a bite and liked the flavor. This is a sandwich I would stop by and have for lunch some other time when I am shopping in Centennial Center. Our friend had the "Tomato Basil Soup" and the Spaghetti & Sausage" and he said the soup was very good. He found the sausage in the spaghetti to be good, but the sauce bland. Parmesan cheese was added and all was good. I would have given 5 stars, but with the main dish not having a *wow* factor this place is more of a 4.5 rating total for me. I enjoyed enough of my food and the service to definitely come back!

I can't speak highly enough about our server, Ellen. She was just fantastic! Ellen checked on us often and when I told her I wanted to try the pizza next time, she surprised me a few minutes later with a sample of hot fresh cheese pizza in a box! She knew I was full, but asked me to try a bite so I could tell her how I liked it. The pizza was hot and delicious. It was thin, crisp and had the right amount of cheese. They sell pizza by the slice so that is good to know for future visits. 

From 11:00 am - 4:00 pm they have a handful of lunch specials that are worth checking out. They also offer gluten free pizza and gluten free pasta. You can place your order online for pick up.

Vegas local, here. I live at MGM/Signature.

SLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class, both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.

The whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative "vibes" or "energies"... but I've gotta say, something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.

One of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that, they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.

The floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?

The part that bothered me the most though was the massive, rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson, MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor, thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds, one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people, so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.

He was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: "because of 9/11". Really? Because of 9/11? I was tempted to give him a "What'choo' talking' 'bout, Willis?" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game, etc.) -- but whatever.

Anyway, I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my "safe zone": Caesars, Mirage, Aria, Cosmo, Mandalay, Fashion Show Mall, and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man, if I stray a bit too far north, it's downright hostile! 

My recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here.

I've been a loyal ikea fan for years so it pains me to write them a bad review.

I recently remodeled my new home and came to ikea for flooring and kitchen cabinets.  I went in to purchase the flooring first but apparently their flooring is being eliminated. They did have one pallet left of the flooring I wanted but I couldn't find it so I asked for help.  I was unimpressed by their searching methods.  Looking in the same place that I already looked and confirming it's not there isn't helpful.

About the same time I went to purchase my cabinets, ikea comes out with a new commercial that's aimed at clueless people who want a new kitchen, so I went in to buy my cabinets with confidence and measurements in hand.  I walked to the kitchen department and waited for an employee to finish up on the computer. I told him I was there to buy cabinets and he asked me if I knew which ones I wanted, I said I didn't so he hands me a booklet and tells me to pick them out and he'll put the order in for me.  I said "don't you guys do this for me" and he said "you have to pick out the cabinets."

Great.  I left and grabbed a glass of that lingadong juice from the restaurant and started figuring out measurements and hurting my head with thoughts of angles and door openings.  When I finished, I headed back to the department to give the guy my list and I saw a couple sitting at the computer with a different Ikea employee and they were living the commercial!  My heart sank.  Why were those jerks getting their entire kitchen designed on cool software and I had to pick mine out of some black and white catalog- 1950's style.  My money is just as green as theirs!  As the guy started entering my order and asking me questions about toe kicks and countertops, my blood started to boil and I let the guy have it for not giving me the same service as the other customers there.  His attitude quickly changed and he became helpful.  At first he had told me to grab the sink drains and cabinet handles on my way out but after our chat, he went and got them for me.

When I went to pay for my order they told me it had to be picked up the same day, not ideal but okay.  I called my contractor and he said he'd be there in a few hours.  I'm pretty sure I'm the first customer to ever buy cabinets but have someone else pick them up because they have no system in place for that.  I had to beg the guy at the counter to help me out but he wouldn't.  So I decide to return the next day when Harry and I can go together.  We come back the next day, I hand the cashier my order to pay and she tells me that they are out of everything. 

Me: really? You're out of every single cabinet that's on my order?

IKEA cashier: yes, really.

Me: In one day you sold out of all these cabinets?That doesn't make sense, these cabinets are on 3 different displays upstairs. This sink has been sold here for years. How can you be out?

IKEA cashier: I don't know, but we're out.  Go talk to "pick-up" about ordering more.

Me: pick up? Really? Okay 

The pick up guy tells me to talk to "returns"
and returns tells me that because the order was placed yesterday, it's coming up as not available. He fixes it and finally I'm able to purchase the kitchen but not before growing contempt for my favorite home store.

Lastly, I get a call from my frustrated contractor because the directions are telling him to drill holes into the cabinet face but there are no marks where to make the holes. I tell him no way, ikea instructions are faultless.  After a 25 minute hold with Ikea support, I find out that guy at the kitchen department was supposed to give me templates for the holes to be made in the cabinets.  Thanks for failing me once again, careless dude.

All you need to know about Cheddar's is that it serves good comfort food and has a well stocked, ample bar area.  

We came here on a Friday night around five. Cheddar's was in the middle of it's opening week growing pains. We were told there was a ten to fifteen minute wait, and nearly fifty-five minutes later, we were seated. LOL

As noted above, the food makes up for the confusion at the hostess station. The servers were on top of their game, and many were backing each other up, busing each other's tables. Nice!

The atmosphere was busy as you could imagine.  But, Jeff the Manager was walking around, keeping a watchful eye on things. He made a point of visiting each table and greeting guests by saying: "welcome to your new favorite neighbor restaurant,". It worked on us. Double, nice!!

The menu is mixture of burgers and steaks, with the prices being extraordinarily reasonable. The half pound burgers on the menu were only$6.29-6.79, with the chicken and steaks around $11-14. 

We started with two ice teas, one regular, the other a Long Island.  Surprisingly they were less than $2.00 apart and came out almost immediately. Did I mention our server Lori was good?  She treated us as if we were her only table!

After the teas arrive, we decided to try the Spinach Dip (see photo) for $5.99. It was very tasty, served with light tortilla chips and warm salsa. 

For our entree, we ordered a half rack of BBQ ribs ($10.79)and the Rib-Eye Philly Steak Sandwich ($8.49).  The ribs had a nice smokey taste. While the only downside was the sandwich, which seemed to have more mushrooms than steak.  

As mentioned above prices are very reasonable, and yes we'll be back after the newness and crowds settled down. Expect to pay around $25 each, including one drink each, one appetizer, taxes and gratuities. 

So Three and a half Stars "A-Okay". But this might change, since Cheddar's has the potential to become a goto neighbor restaurant.

Dear person who decided that we would have our "after party" at Chez Nous,

It is with the most utmost regret that inform you that you're choice of after party venues was teh suck. And no, I did not misspell "the". That's how we say it these days. Get with the times, sucka.

But seriously, wtf?

Through what twisted logic did you come to the conclusion that the best way to top off a birthday party at fez laden with free appetizers, cake, and drink specials was an over-priced, overcrowded jazz bar...on a Saturday night?

Now before I go any further, I shall confess to you that I was spared the $7 dollar charge. My friend and I managed to talk the doorman down to $4 for the two of us. Perhaps he was desperate to get more ladies into the establishment. Perhaps he's just a chump.

In either case, you'll be interested to know that while waiting in the parking lot for my friend's boyfriend to show up, I witnessed the doorman using your $7 to help pay for a pizza and hot sandwich from Dominos. 

Unlike some of the other ladies in our party, I will not complain about the ass-grabbing and creepy smiles I received. Because I didn't receive any. No, menacing glares and bathroom gossip was my lot. Feeling that my safety was in jeopardy, I was compelled to make a hasty exit in the middle of the chorus of "Ladies Night". 

I'm not going to fault you for inviting me to a totally UN-safe space (because maybe I should've done some research before I took you up on it), but if you were a vegan I wouldn't invite you to a place that I knew had no vegan-friendly options. I'm going to leave it at that.

And I'm not going to expect you to ask all of us our age, but please be aware that there are a great number of us who were NOT products of the 70's and have little use for disco and gold chains. 

The average patron had to be at least 10 years older and 20 years more behind on fashion than even you'd ever tolerate in a date. I take solace in the knowledge that you were just as unlucky as I would be (if I was single and into cougars, that is).

I know that the overall cost of Chez Nous might seem a little exaggerated, considering we just had free appetizers and cake at FEZ, but nothing ruins a birthday party afterglow like inane ATM fees and greedy, smooth-talking doormen.

Regardless, I want you to know that despite my displeasure with your recent choice of after-party locales, I still love you. 

In fact, I'm grateful to you, in my own way. It's so hard to be funny and snarky when you're writing a 4-5 star review of a place. In a time where my ability to nitpick and rant, it's refreshing to finally find a place so terrible I am justified in my neurosis. 

In the event that all of this is too wordy and convoluted to understand, I've made you a chart.

P.S. Nathan, I still have your coat. Let's make arrangements to get it back to you. The longer I have it the longer I'm going to be tempted to use it the next time Misty S and I have "roleplay night". 

Which I might do anyway if I find out all this was your idea : - )

I saw a lot of mixed reviews on Burger Bar (both for this location and the one in San Francisco), but I was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on Top Chef Masters.

It actually took some time to find it.  Burger Bar is not located in Mandalay Bay but Mandalay Place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  It was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  When Burger Bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.

The atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  The atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  The dining area was not that big.  Seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.

The focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  While it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for Las Vegas.  Many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in L.A.  At Burger Bar, there are a few pricier burgers and burgers can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.

I went with the American Kobe Beef burger.  The burger was about small-to-medium sized.  A lot of burger places like The Counter and Father's Office definitely have bigger burgers.  The bun (which can be customized) was nice.  The tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  I got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade Dijon mustard.  The meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  It was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.

I ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  Skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  I liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  Since they just opened the restaurant, I was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  I've definitely had my share of food in Vegas that was served cold, but I would think this place would have a higher standard.

The milkshake was expensive but good.  It was a chocolate and Nutella milkshake.  It had a good flavor and consistency.  It could have been a little colder.  It was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  It was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  While I liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.

The waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.

There is a lot of bad and overpriced food in Vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  Burger Bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the Vegas restaurants I've tried.  It also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  Still, if you go to one of those cafes in Vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.

I probably would not make a special trip to Burger Bar, but if we were around Mandalay Bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, Burger Bar would definitely be a place I would give another try.

Final Note: For me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  Chef Hubert Keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  He was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).

I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)

I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-I

But I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)

And, I like taco's:)

And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(

But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(

I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)

I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)

Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)

10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)

No beach at 5th and Camelback:(

But, I digress:)

I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)

I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)

Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.

So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!

Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...

That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)

But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(

In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(

There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

So I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little biased, I love her. She is my favorite chef on Food Network. I was excited to try this place, at first I planned to wait a few months and let all the hype die down, but when my friend scored us a 7p reservation, I changed my mind pretty quickly. 

When we arrived, we waited way passed our reservation time, only to find out Giada was in the house, so people were staying longer at their tables. As soon as we walked in, she was there taking pics with people on their way out. 

We were started with a tour of the restaurant and the prep area, which was fun to see. Our table could not have been in a better spot. Perfect view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Greeted immediately by our waiter who gave us a quick rundown of the iPad cocktail menu, we all started out with a signature cocktail.  Something different for everyone, and every single person enjoyed their drinks. I tried the Destroyer, Clase Azul Tequila Reposado, tangerine, orange and basil, basil ice sphere, as well as the La Strada, Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, Proseco, and (don't judge) Barbarella, Tanqueray #10, orange spice ginger beer, fresh lemon, basil foam (this was my favorite).  

I was excited to see they offered a tasting menu but to my disappointment, we were informed the way they have their tasting menu set up is a family style, so everyone at the table is required to order the tasting menu. So we went with the original plan of ordering something different for everyone to try. We started our with their amazing bread basket, I was more obsessed with the condiments that it came with, the lemon butter and the dried capers with my favorite. Onto the apps, we couldn't decide so we ordered multiple. The large appetizer platter was big enough for 5 people and it had a little but of everything. I had picked the Oysters Crudo, which were fantastic, the Burrata, amazing, Lobster Arancini, best Arancini I have had. I could have stopped at the apps and been happy. 

I originally had planned to get the Lemon Spaghetti, but then I wanted the Branzino, so our waiter told me to order the Branzino and I could have the Spaghetti as a side. Perfect! This dish was executed to perfection. I love Seabass, this had a perfect char on the skin, and the Lemon Spaghetti is as good as everyone says. The shrimp was as big as my palm.  My friends Rack of Lamb was my favorite. I would order this next time. The Ribeye was cooked perfectly too. TONS of sides! Ravioli, Crispy Polenta, Asparagus, and Lemon Potatoes. 

Next up, the dessert tray. I was so full by the time this came around, but we still indulged. She has some really unique desserts.

Service was excellent, our server was very attentive, as well as everyone else that helped him out.

Highlight of my night, she came around to the table and spoke with us about our meal. She was so personable and nice, upon leaving, I was able to take a picture with her. Totally made my night.

They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on "Sandwich Wars" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free "Mini Cannoli" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said "yeah yeah they get a free mini" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it. 

They deliver!

In my first review of Picasso 6 years ago, I compared dining here to having a one night stand with a celebrity.  

Well who said you can't hook up again when they're back in town???

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 6th anniversary with a nice dinner.   It had been a long time since we were last here and it sounded a lot better than going to Red Lobster.  The original plan was to dine indoors and admire all the wonderful, priceless Picasso art displayed around the restaurant since we sat outside last time.  The hostess informed us they had a table open outside and asked if we wanted to check it out before deciding.  The fountain show was going off right then and we gave into the temptation of the patio once again.  Screw art :)  It's one of the best atmospheres to dine in Vegas!  I can't say no!

You get one of two course choices, there's the prix fixe and the menu dgustation.  We ordered one of each with wine pairings and even though the menu hadn't changed very much over the years, it was even more awesome now than before.  I think I appreciate fine dining now more than I did 6 years ago but that could also be due to prescription pills.  

We're foie gras crazy people so that was one of the many highlights.  The foie gras au torchon is the way my wife prefers it while I love their "sauted steak of "A" foie gras".  The tenderness, oil and fattyness of it all complimented with figs and pistachios is like having a mouthful of multiple orgasms.

The pan seared U-10 day boat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau is like the most perfect, hand picked scallop.  A pearl!  I try to eat as small a bite as possible to savor it all.  

You basically can't go wrong with any of it.  Why change the menu when it's pretty much perfect?  This also marks the first time I've gotten through wine courses without leaving totally bombed at the end.  I must be getting more mature :P

Service was A++ from beginning to end and they offered us an extra dessert dish to celebrate the occasion.  We had such a great time that we ended up being the last ones in the place!

Due to some personal circumstances, I spent a month and a half drinking nothing but protein shakes. Today would either be the day I would be able to eat like a normal human being, or the day I would rip out all the hair on the top of my head. After seeing the Doc today and getting the OK to eat regular foods again, there was really only one place that I wanted to go to... and that place was SnowFlake Shavery. (Actually 2 places, but I'll save In-n-out for tomorrow's lunch :D )

Now, I was a big fan of the Frost Bites Shavery Truck, a food trailer located in the outskirts of Henderson NV that made the best snow ice in the Valley. I've had American snowballs growing up and after moving to Nevada from the east coast, I was exposed to Hawaiian shaved ice--which was my favorite for a while. But snow ice (which originated in Taiwan) takes frozen treats to a whole 'nother level. It's sort of like eating freshly fallen snow, flavored with dairy and sweetened. It's melt-in-your-mouth texture is sublime. When properly made, it is like nothing you've ever had before in your life. When I found out the Frost Bites guys were opening up a brick-n-mortar spot called SnowFlake Shavery, I was ecstatic. And today would be my chance to try it out.

SnowFlake Shavery is located in the busy Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones Blvd. It's located in the same strip mall as some of Vegas' other "off the Strip" heavy hitters - Raku, Big Wong, Kabuto, Monta etc. 

After walking in, I was greeted by the owner's Will and Mike. Being a much bigger space than the Frost Bites trailer, they are able to carry a larger selection of items', including popular favorites such as mochi, red bean, different cereal toppings, and my personal favorite, egg custard. I even saw that they carried a new snow ice flavor, cantaloupe. I didn't get to try the new flavor this time, but I will make sure to get it next time :) Being familiar with the the old Frost Bites menu, I had to order my favorite combination that I have been missing out on for the past 6 weeks. I'll refer to this combination as the "Michael K". 

The "Michael K" - It's black sesame snow ice, fresh mango, and sweetened condensed milk. To a lot of people, this combination won't make a lot of sense. That's one of the main reasons it's called the Michael K (j/k) :P. But, IMO, it works.. really, really, well. Being a big fan of egg custard (especially with boba), I decided to get the Michael K. with egg custard as well. Holy Schmokers!!!! I personally thought that this combo could not be improved on. I thought that I had hit the pinnacle of flavor and texture. Well, I had a revelation. Let me put it to y'all like this, the brand new Michael K. is - black sesame snow ice, fresh mango, sweetened condensed milk AND... drum roll please... egg custard. Boom!

Get in your car, or walk if your close by, and get a Michael K., or many of their other flavors and combos such as strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, green tea, coconut, and many more (or just make your own personal combo.) Whatever you do, if you haven't tried this place, get here ASAP. You'll thank yourself later. Michael out.

I am flabbergasted. Flummoxed. Freaking the fug out. 

WHY IS THIS PLACE NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT ON YELP!?!?!?

I'm sorry, I just had to get that out of my system. 

But seriously, how is it POSSIBLE that only one review exists for Fantasy Costume Rentals and that it dates back to 2009??? This is a spectacular business!

First off, let me tell you a funny little story about my discovery of this gem. My birthday was a couple of weeks ago, and I was planning a little shindig for myself. In true Heather fashion (I tend to go a little over the top with everything I do) I chose to have a theme, the "Roaring 20's" as I was turning 29 (OMG I'm effing THIRTY next year?! When the hell did that happen??) 
I digress. 

I was looking for a costume and was unhappy with my choices at the "other" costume shop that shall not be named that seems to hold a monopoly on costume rentals in the valley. It was about midnight on a Sunday. I did a google search for costume rentals and Fantasy Costumes came up. I of course go straight to the reviews, and when I saw the only one written was in 2009, I was convinced they were no longer open. How would a costume fanatic like myself not know of this place? I decided to call the business number (keep in mind the time of night) to see if it was a disconnected number or if I reached a message listing hours. A man answers. Completely astounded to hear a live voice on the other end of the line, I stammered,
"Um, is this Fantasy Costumes??" 
"Yes, it sure is."
"OMG, I'm SOOOO sorry for calling so late. I didn't think anyone would answer!"
"It's ok, I have calls forwarded to my cell in case of emergencies." 
"So, uh, when are you open?"
"Tues-Sun 10am-6pm"
"Cool, thanks. Well, I'll be seeing you in person soon! Goodnight!"

Located on University off of McKemy (near Hardy), this is a small unassuming shop that you really have to know about to notice. In the front of the shop are two large catalogs with pictures of the costumes in order of category, with a list of sizes each costume is available in. This makes it so easy to shop for something. I pointed at a couple of costumes and asked the owner about them. One he replied "That one's really cheesy. I don't think you'll like it, but this one (he points) is really nice." and then proceeds to bring out some options for me to try on.

For $45, I rented a super cute silver flapper dress (see pics), which came with a feather headpiece, long pearl necklace, boa, and free fishnet stockings!. The "other" costume shop wanted $50 for a similar dress and that did not include the boa ($10 extra), necklace, or stockings. Just the dress and headband. 

My boyfriend also rented a super cool gangster costume, which the owner was sure to adjust the length of the pants for him before we picked up the costumes. Again, it came with everything. Hat, shirt, tie, gloves, shoe covers, and he even pinned a red carnation on the jacket! Last minute, Jared realized the suspenders weren't with the costume and he called the owner (on Sunday, the day he is closed) and the owner told him to come by right away and he would get the suspenders to him. 

A couple of things to note. You can only pay with CASH or CHECK and a deposit (2x the cost of the rental) is required. But I will tell you, it is SO worth it. This guy is so organized, really cares for his costumes, and is not about nickel and diming. He provides a quality product for a reasonable price. I will be using Fantasy Costumes for my costume needs from this point on! Love love love!

Food: quite delicious. Atmosphere: rockin'. Customer service? I'm disheartened to say that it's extremely disappointing! Therefore the three stars is only for the food and atmosphere. I've been to Copper Blues three times now and every time there's always been some sort of hiccup. However, the hiccups were short lived and soon forgotten. Unfortunately the hiccup during this last visit won't be so easily forgotten. 

This past Friday night, we went to see Bob Saget perform (he is absolutely hilarious by the way). Before the show, we wanted to grab dinner so we decided to make it easy and eat at Copper Blues. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer and quoted for a 10-minute wait. We asked if there was open seating anywhere and they directed us to the outdoor patio and said that was the only open seating. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we checked back with the hostess on the status and at that point, she said it was going to be a 35 minute wait. We said that we were told 10 minutes initially and then she said, "oh well, then it's 10 minutes I guess." It was all very confusing. So after about another 10 minutes, we checked back again and at this point they said that they never quote a wait time and when I told them that I had been quoted twice, she said again that they never quote a wait time. I felt like I was on crazy pills! It didnt seem like the staff knew what was going on that night! Well, the saga continues on... 

At this point, it's around 6:00 PM and we are hungry and eager to get some dinner before Saget. It was also freezing on the outdoor patio and we were hoping to sit inside. We decide to check out the inside portion of the restaurant (even though we were told initially that the only open seating was outside). Well, when we got inside, we realized that the entire bar area was also open seating. Now this is where the hiccup will forever stay with me and it will be hard to get over this next part. We find two high top tables and are told that one is in use, so we take the other one. It has three chairs and we need two more chairs. At this point, a waiter comes up and confronts us. I let him know that we are in need of two more chairs and do they have any (this is in the open seating bar, remember.) He turns to me, stares at me dead on and says "well are you even planning on eating here or are you just going to be using this table to wait?" Now regardless of whether we were going to order one drink or a whole meal, I don't think a waiter should ever question a customer and treat them the way I was treated. I proceed to tell him that we are wanting to eat dinner and we have been wanting to eat dinner there for a good thirty minutes! I was blown away by the treatment and I will admit that I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Someone must have seen my anger and utter shock because about five minutes later they told us they found a table at the bar for us but sadly at that point, the experience at Copper Blues was ruined. We ordered several drinks and a couple appetizers (which were delicious) but after the treatment, decided to just eat dinner at Stand Up Live. 

I hate writing a disappointing review like this one. I visit restaurants wanting a good experience and wanting to enjoy the atmosphere. However, customer service can either make or badly break an experience.

As the Chicago area hot dog critic one thing I've noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs aren't nearly as popular other places as they are in Chicagoland. I did a search for hot dog stands near where I'm staying during my trip to the Phoenix Arizona area and found a place called "Ted's Hot Dogs" and the next closest place was immediately familiar. It was Portillo's, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban Chicago that has apparently made its way to Arizona.

I finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that I noticed is that it's every bit as busy as the Chicagoland locations. The parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. There were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.  

Now, I've been to the Chicago area Portillo's many times and have reviewed a few locations. As a child I met Dick Portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of Portillo's as a chain. Over the years, the quality control at Portillo's has diminished. The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.

Upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like "Number two, your order is due", "Number three come see me". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.

Finally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.

For any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.

So how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear. 

I also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside. 

My overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially true since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.

Giving two stars based on the food, location (walking distance from my house) and the decor are amazing... If it weren't for these things Id give negative stars, I've eaten here twice now and had very different experiences...

A few days ago I came here for the first time and brought my mom and Andy. We were very impressed with the rustic decor and the outside setting. It's absolutely beautiful on the patio. 
We had the butternut soup, that was phenomenal. Butternut squash with creme frise and leeks for garnish.  
For entrees we each had a different sandwich, I had the bbq brisket. I was expecting a bbq sauce since that's what the cashier told us.. but none of the less it was still great.
Andy had the Pastrami sandwich which also was missing a sauce bit once we put their housemade Dijon mustard on it the sandwich was great. 
The sweet potato fries are great as well! 

Now for the second trip...

Came in last night (Tuesday around 7pm) and sat at the bar. We never received service, we waited about 10 minutes before we went up to the cashier. The girl told us the bartender never showed up so we had to order at the register. We ordered the calamari, shrimp tacos, and the butternut soup. I asked the girls (two blonde girls and one brunette) if there were any nuts in the tacos or the calamari. I AM DEATHLY ALLERGIC to tree nuts and peanuts. I've been admitted to the hospital twice with my throat closing due to my allergy. No one knew so they asked the cooks. They just shrugged and said there wasn't. When I asked if they were certain (i had forgotten my epipen at home because we walked to the restaurant) they started laughing at me. 
We also ordered the Apricot Cider, so we took our drink and headed outside. When our food arrived we noticed the calamari was accompanied with a green sauce. The brunette told us it was a parsley sauce. We also noticed there weren't any leeks on the butternut soup... That made the soup very bland without the added flavor. 
When I tried a piece of Calamari dipped in the parsley sauce it really tasted like pesto. Andy and I headed inside to ask about it. Because pesto 90% of the time is made with Pine nuts. We were told yes it was pesto. Andy dialed 911 because no one knew if there were nuts in the pesto. NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT KNEW. Then when I told the brunette girl my throat would literally close she LAUGHED and said oh don't be a drama queen, no it won't. ....

What can I even say about that. 20 minutes later we finally found out the pesto was nut free. After me having a full blown freak out panic attack it completely ruined my experience here. When asked if they could bring us ice cream on the house we declined and the blonde girl asked what could she bring us and I jokingly said another drink, she immediately brought us another bottle of apricot cider with a receipt. Then said we could pay for that anytime. 

Now, I've worked in the service industry since I was 14. (13 Years now...) My professional opinion and advice is this, TRAIN YOUR STAFF. Especially the cooks. I can forgive a ditzy cashier girl but I can't forgive a "chef" that has no idea what they're cooking. Hire a manager to oversee daily operations and handle guest issues. If this would have happened to anyone else I'm sure they wouldn't have been as nice as Andy and I. 

I want to come back. I liked the food and you can't beat the location. But these kinks need to be worked out before they kill someone, because no one is trained or held accountable.

First impression, this place rocks!! It's in the space that used to house Palette.. the space has a very "breezy" sort of Caribbean plantation feel that's easy to relax right into.. not to mention the moment you walk through the gate you're greeted by friendly smiling faces. 

LB has a massive outdoor patio complete with tables, well appointed outdoor sofas and chairs where you can leisurely sip a cocktail or beer. While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human. 

The menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.

Meanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous. We didn't have wine service but the manager Eric used to be the sommelier at The Grill at TPC back in the day when it was one of the best steak houses in town. He knows his wine so I look forward to next time when I can enjoy a glass or 6. 

I ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous! 

The Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience! 

First impressions last nearly forever and this one was great! I think LB has a bright future in front of them. This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends, drinks and cool conversation. Excellent addition to the neighborhood.

Avoid this place. BY FAR THE WORST GENTLEMAN'S CLUB I'VE BEEN TO IN VEGAS! 

Wife and I went to Vegas a few weeks ago and usually we visit one of the Gentlemen's clubs we know we enjoy. The Cab driver insisted on Sapphires claiming it was the "Worlds biggest with plenty of seating". We figured sure why not. Some clubs in Vegas its hard to find seating, so when he mentioned the place was huge and seating was not a problem we figured it was worth a shot to try a new place.

BIG MISTAKE. 

After paying the $40 cover to get inside we're greeted by a gentleman with two dancers next to him almost like they're next in line for the next group that walks in the door. Seemed awkward to us. Both girls, pretty in their own regard, were not our type and I was hoping he wasn't going to try and throw them at us. 

As we approached him, he asked us how many were in our party, and I told him 4. He gave us one look and said go ahead and walk in with no other information. As we walk down to a large room full of tons of empty chairs we notice EVERY SINGLE TABLE has the word "Reserved" on it. We see there is a second room that is completely empty with the same signs. We look over to the bar and notice its shoulder to shoulder packed.

My initial guess is that they don't allow you to sit down in this place unless you pay additional money to sit in one of their "Reserved" seats, but we were not quite sure yet. Anyways, we walk up to the extremely crowded bar area and order 4 drinks. Like others have stated its about $14-$16 a drink. I saw a girl ask for some water and they gave her the tiniest bottle and it was $10. She almost flipped her lid. The bar was a mad house every one was just there standing staring at the dancers on stage. Also since the bar is perched up they could see all the "Reserved" tables with the patrons getting lap dances.

The over crowding of the Bar became to much so my wife went back to the gentleman who told us to just walk in and ask him about all the reserved tables. When she asked what the story was with those he said "Go get your entire group and we can talk about pricing". My wife again asked if he can simply explain how this all works and rudely the douche replies "Go get your group and we can talk about pricing". 

Needless to say we were done. So let me get this straight, we pay $40 to get in, then before taking 5 steps in to the place we were to be confronted to pay additional money to sit? If not our only option is to be shoulder to shoulder with everyone at the bar. And should we choose to pay for one of your "Reserved" seats, we get the pleasure of everyone at the bar gawking at us while we enjoy our personal dance?

This place is a joke. This is one of the first times I have hated my experience at a gentleman's club in Vegas. The other couple we brought it was their first time at a gentleman's club so he had to apologize on behalf of Sapphire's and tell them this is not how normal clubs function. If anything they've just experienced the worst of the worst. We ended up going to one of our favorite clubs and spent a lot of money and enjoyed ourselves. Unlike Sapphires, we spent it willingly and not forcefully. Please don't make the same mistake we did, there are plenty of other clubs that are a thousand times better than this god awful establishment.

Ric's "where's the smoke" Smokehouse BBQ & Grill needs to rethink their restaurant strategy quickly or they will find themselves closing faster than what it took them to open....

I reeeaaalllyyyy wanted to like this place!  I'm a huge fan of BBQ and a fan of small business owners.  They are somewhat handicapped with a location that has gobbled up prior restaurants that closed almost as fast as they opened, never to be heard from again....  But it was their choice to open a Restaurant in this spot.

"Where's the smoke"?  One of the first things you will notice about Ric's Smokehouse when you enter is there isn't any wonderful aromas of cooked BBQ, smoked or otherwise.  There is no BBQ aroma, What the heck?  You should always smell some kind of aromatic BBQ goodness when you enter a BBQ, especially when the word "smoke" is in their name!

After a completely disastrous first visit with horrible food and poor service I held back on writing my Yelp review to give this new business an opportunity to work through the kinks. I shared my concerns about their food with the people at Ric's in hopes they would consider making some changes that would help them.  

Now that I have been back twice since my first visit and the issues I pointed out during my first visit still exist.  I don't feel so bad at all in letting my Yelp friends know that Eek! Methinks not! when it comes to choosing Ric's Smokehouse BBQ & Grill as a BBQ place to eat at.

Food ~ they offer four to five different selections of BBQ sauce, which two of them are really good.  Pork sandwich comes with one side at $7.99 when other BBQ places give you two sides for the same price.  The pork on all three visits was over cooked with no smoke rings.  When pork is over cooked the ends of the pork become very dry, hard and chewy.  It taste a little like pork jerky.  Now they keep their pork in an au jus but it still over cooked and the au jus just soaks into the bun and does not keep the pork moist.  The bun they use is very tasty and they toast it.  The sides ~ not so good...

The brisket was pretty good however they sever it with the fat still on it.  Some fat might be ok but when the fat is 1/4 of the portion of meat your getting it's not so good.  Again it too is missing the aroma of BBQ  and a smoke ring.  The first potato salad was disgusting since they used frozen potatoes, however during my last visit the potato salad wasn't much better.  The mac-y-cheese and baked beans were huge flops with little to no flavor.  Most of their food is supposed to come with either a cheese biscuit or cornbread.  They keep forgetting to give that to their customers and when you ask for it, they give it to you cold, blah...

I'm not going to elaborate on the service since this review is already way too long.

This owner needs to rethink their business strategy and get some culinary help and advise quickly!  Buy a smoker maybe?  

Their are other BBQ options in and around the Phoenix metro ~ all of them are much better than this place unfortunately.

Bewbz, Boobies & Tittays.

Now this. THIS is art I can get down with. 

On a brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was one of top items on our very limited 'To-Do' list. We opted to skip the Warhol Museum and 'go to the Mattresses' because it seemed a bit more dynamic and also, I'll be honest, cheaper. 

Now, I'm not an art fanatic by any means. I look at it, I see things, I don't feel any emotional attachment, nothing's stirred, nothing moves me. I'm just dead inside. It's just a thing I'm looking at, that means zilch to me, though I'd be more than happy to assign anything 'art' a number from 1-10 to accurately show how boring or not boring I find it. Ignorant? Yes. Most definitely. But it's honest and I'd like to think there's a bit of honor in coming clean over bullshitting through some phony explanation of why something I really don't care for is or isn't poignant, and with that being said I liked the Mattress Factory because it didn't feel like a stuffy art museum. It was fun, you could move about almost freely, no guards, just guides and at points you're even encouraged to explore and touch. 

What I liked about the Mattress factory was that it had a sense of humor. It wasn't all serious all the time as we quickly discovered upon entering the 'Breast in the Press' installation, consisting of a dark room with an absolutely enormous statue of a topless woman with comically huge breasts and a music video being projected in onto each boob to the tune of 'My Humps' by the Black-Eyed Peas, but with the words changed and the large-breasted creator of the work singing topless while smashing her inked up breasts against sheets of paper at a desk, as if she was writing the news with her fun bags. This was an exhibit we saw back in November/December, and still, if I hear any clip of 'My Humps', I can't help but think of the Mattress Factory titty song. 

Another exhibit we walked into and 'accidentally' crushed part of. I use mini-quotes for the word 'accidentally' because at first I really did step on one of the ping pong balls littering the rectangular room on accident, but then when it popped and no one from the museum came out to yell at me I took it as free reign to do it again... and again, and again, and again and then eventually I just started picking them up started throwing them at my friends- triple words score if you hit in the testiculars! Anyway, I don't know what the artist wanted me to get from the exhibit, but I just assumed it was a test in seeing how long it took a regular museum-goer to turn delinquent and start wrecking sh*t. 

The exhibits using light were really cool. All optical illusion-y and the one pitch black room where you're only supposed to go two-at-a-time was great for scaring friends. We had a truce to not creep up or bad touch anyone in the exhibit, but of course we all failed to withhold our end of the treaty and it went from a silent 2-person exhibit to a screeching, poking, fondling, scary exhibit. Again, I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it, but somehow we all ended up interpreting it as the another 'break the rules' room. 

The doll room was creepy, but cool. As a hoarder, I appreciated being able to show my friends one place that might be scarier than mess-menagerie at my own place. Now maybe I'll invite them over. 

The room with the water was fun to jump from stone to stone and throw rocks and the sound thing hanging from the ceiling was neat if you were lucky enough to be by while someone walked over it from the floor above, but they should really make the 'Do not touch' sign bigger if they really don't want you to touch it, because I did not see that sh*t till my hands already gave it a good touch.

The mirror room was the best part next to boobs. It's kind of silly, but it felt more interactive because you have to either take your shoes off or put mesh booties on to enter. It basically a bunch of colors and dots and mirrors and a few mannequins, but you can see yourself from all angles and somehow it was more fun than a standard dressing room, though it was basically the same, but with more decoration. Our group probably would've stayed here all day if there wasn't another group waiting to go in. 

There's more to the museum than just the one building, if you leave there's an outdoor area that was awesome because I saw a lizard go down the well thing and then I tried to catch it but I almost fell in the mud and my friends were ready to move on and climb other stuff, then if you go down the back alley/parking lot, around the corner and down up the road, you just flash your badge/ticket stub and you can see their other exhibit made up of odd housing installations. It wasn't reveting, but I liked the little hidden words and phrases found throughout the house. It felt like getting the fortune slip out of a fortune cookie, but without having to eat it. 

If you're in Pittsburgh, defo pencil in the Mattress Factory for a 2-hour art excursion.

UPDATE: Someone (who just joined Yelp btw) sent me an extremely abusive email via Yelp re: my negative review. Whoever this person is, firstly, doesnt speak/write english properly, and secondly, makes threats that are ridiculous (I.e Tina will kick my ass if I ever went back to her cafe?!) Are you kidding me?! First of all, i will never ever go back there, unless I'm needed by the Health Dept. to testify against this establishment, and second, don't ever threaten me, especially when I'm giving my honest opinion. Have you heard of freedom of speech? Sounds like Tina has a posse, but that is all she'll ever have when she loses her business due to dubious business practices! 

Hands down, absolutely the worst dining experience I've ever had. We only stayed because we were already there, and I had purchased a Groupon, wow what a waste. We sat down, and weren't even acknowledged for at least 10min. Then, the menus came about 20min later. So, about 30min of total wasted time. Maybe they were hoping we would read the disgustingly dirty book that was on the table on Ethiopia? It's a great idea, until you realize it's not practical at all for a restaurant. Forget that our copy was from 1964. I'm sure even Ethiopia has changed since then. 

Moving on to the ambiance/decor. Absolutely, disgusting and dirty. It's old, owner's kids were playing in and out of the kitchen (hello??), the kids' high chair (which was a regular high chair, not a restaurant style) was so disgusting, I had no idea what to do with my baby. 

Food. OMG. The amount of food you get is meager. I'm not kidding. It's a tiny little portion, probably about 3 tablespoons? It came out cold and it looked like someone had thrown it up. I had ordered the biggest plate that combined most of the foods (which by the way, there are only 15 on the menu, and they were out of 4 of them), and my husband had ordered his own plate. After we patiently waited for the food, the server (who had no idea what was going on) came out and asked us if it's ok for them to put my husband's order on my plate. What? Why? But we said "fine" b/c frankly, we wanted to just leave! In any case, the amount of my food was reduced by what my husband's food took up as space, which is not much, believe me. The quality of the food was just subpar. Cold, not tasty and lacking in meat.The "bread" was wet and sour, and I don't believe that's how ethiopian bread is. Some entries were beef and chicken, but you wouldn't have known it if it wasn't indicated on the menu. There were probably 2-3 TINY pieces of chicken/beef over all, I'm not kidding. (I wonder if it's b/c I told them we had a Groupon in advance, and they just gave us a tiny amount of cold food with no apparent presence of meat.) 

Service was just horrible, and the girl (was she the owner, or maybe the owner's daughter?) who waited on us at first, had no people or service skills. The boy who came in late apparently, was out second server, and he mentioned it was his second day, so he had absolutely no idea what to do. It was so sad to watch, really. The woman was just awkward. I wondered if there was something behind the scenes (in the kitchen) we weren't aware of, that was making the people working there completely incapacited. I also thought that if this restaurant can survive, anyone can be in the restaurant business apparently. 

I have traveled a lot, and am open to and love other cultures (I, myself, am not American), but this was by far not a tolerable or pleasant experience in any way. Looking at their website, you would think they are a well-established and clean business  but make no mistake, they are absolutely not. I am actually surprised they are still operating, and have a license. My husband and I wondered how long they will stay open, he gave them a month (but I have no idea how long they've been open for already.) Either way, we will NEVER ever go back there and waste another dollar. Please don't waste your money.

===================
The Eiffel Tower Restaurant sits on the 11th floor of the Paris' Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas; it provides a decor, atmosphere and dining experience that is fitting with its name (which you may either enjoy or find cheesy depending on your likes/dislikes).

A private glass elevator takes guests up to the restaurant (kind of an interesting view of floors and activity on the way up and the way back down).  The elevators opens up to the kitchen where the chefs plate the food.

The restaurant utilizes an old-fashioned dining room--plush red seating and white tablecloth--but the stodginess of it is cut dramatically by the view and utilization of the Eiffel Tower's metal legs within the restaurant.

The tables are strategically placed so that many tables have a great view of The Strip (with the primary attraction being the Bellagio Fountains).  Lots of big floor-to-ceiling windows create the great view.  The metal framework cuts into the restaurant and it gives it kind of an art deco feel.  The art deco feel with the old-fashioned decor really make this place feel like a restaurant from another era.

They started us off with a cream soup amuse bouche that was okay but not great.  The complimentary bread was also okay but not memorable.

We had some appetizers.  The lobster Pain Perdu was kind of like a lobster bread souffle.  It was okay though not great.  We also had some sea scallops that were served in a wine sauce with onions.  The scallops dish was also just okay.  The scallops were tender and seasoned right.  I've had much better though in terms of scallops (both in outside sear and moistness) as well as the accompanying sauces and sides.

We also had a little bit of their cold seafood platter, which included lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, and clams.  This is not my favorite type of starter (I would rather have hot seafood where the chefs get a little more creative in how they garnish/sauce/cook the seafood).  Everything was okay, but nothing really stood out here.

I had the venison chop as my entree.  The venison chop had a nice red color, but it was not that juicy.  The meat was tender enough and had a decent though not spectacular flavor.  The huckleberry reduction sounded good, but it did not really do much here (not a particularly prominent flavor on the plate).

The main side to the venison chop was an oatmeal cake.  This is the second time I've had oatmeal with dinner (the other time was Bistro LQ).  This would not be my favorite side--not bad (definitely tastes like oatmeal).  The plate also featured black trumpet mushrooms and these were pretty good.  They had a nice crunch to them.

I also tried one of the a la carte slides--classic potato gratin.  It was kind of lukewarm.  The potatoes were tender but a little bland (and lacked a creamy cheesy flavor).

While almost all of the food was average, the dessert was a real winner.  I had the chocolate souffle and it was probably one of the best chocolate souffles I've had.  It had a great chocolate flavor (they served it with a chocolate ganache, which was also good).  What separated the chocolate souffle was the texture.  Very nicely baked.  Great texture and great lift.  Chocolate souffles are hard to get right.  They are typically dry, spongy or liquidy.  This one though was pretty close to perfect.

I also had some vanilla ice cream, which was creamy but pretty standard stuff.

Service was good in terms of getting the food out at a good pace even though the restaurant was incredibly busy (which also caused the restaurant to be quite warm and loud).  I felt though that the waiter was not as good as some of the other waiters I've had recently.  He did a good enough job, but I felt he was a little stuffy.  I think he could have been a little more personable and relaxed.

Las Vegas restaurants are typically overpriced and Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a pretty good example of that.  The food here would be in the same price range as some of the most expensive and best restaurants in L.A.  Even when comparing Eiffel Tower Restaurant to other pricey Vegas restaurants, Eiffel Tower Restaurant still feels very overpriced.  The prices here are similar to Mesa Grill, but the flavors at Mesa Grill are much better (Mesa Grill uses better ingredients too).

Eiffel Tower Restaurant makes a great souffle and I would come back for that.  The food, however, is overpriced and average (despite having the backing of prominent chef Jean Joho, who also operates the Michelin starred Everest in Chicago).  Even though I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, I think you could do much better on The Strip than Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

I walked here, but I imagine they have complimentary valet parking or self-parking like the other big Vegas casinos.

What to do when you get to the airport WAY early AND your flight out of Vegas is delayed at least another thirty minutes?  Duh!  Drink, silly!

Since this was on my way OUT of Sin City instead of on my way IN, I was no naive sap:

Me: "How much is the Mangorita?" (drink prices are ODDLY not listed on the menu)

Waiter: "One Mangorita."

Me: "No.  How MUCH DOES IT COST?"

Waiter: "$12"

Me:  "That's what I thought.  I'll have a Mangorita, please."

Hey, you expected me NOT to get it? 

Actually, for Vegas prices, this was quite reasonable (who would have imagined that food and drinks would be CHEAPER at the airport than in the city you're visiting?).  The Mangorita surprisingly tasted like REAL and FRESH mango instead of some artificial "mango" syrup.  It was blended and slightly sweet but not syrupy and served in a pint glass. Also, the waiter claimed it had a double shot of tequila and while I couldn't taste it, I sure as hell felt it.  

Woo!  Drunk plane ride!  Yay!

I also ordered the chicken chimichanga.  As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.  It was filled with plenty of shredded chicken but also with shredded lettuce.  Um, WILTED shredded lettuce.  Bleh again.

The chips tasted like they came from a bag opened yesterday instead of being made on site. The salsa tasted like it may have been made last week by my mother who considers black pepper to be "too spicy" to add to her food. Triple bleh!

One last bit of super USEFUL info: this is ONLY a good option if you've got PLENTY of time before your flight.  

Our meal took over an HOUR.  The waiter came over, took our drink order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back, took our food order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our drinks, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our water, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our food, said "right away" when I asked him to bring the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, brought the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back for the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with the receipt to sign.  I have no idea if he came back to pick up the signed receipt because we didn't wait around another 10 minutes.  

I found this really weird for a restaurant in an airport. We were inside the "secure area" so it's not like we just stopped by for a nice lunch.  We had a plane to catch!

Jinya, whatever culinary wizardry you got going on in the kitchen, keep it up! My tastebuds thank you. 

Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth. 

I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly. 

Here's what I recommend: 
- Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled "seasoned egg" is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen- 

Toppings added: 
- Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend. 
- Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend! 
- Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta. 

We also tried:
- Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.  

- Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender. 

Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places. 

I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way? That's crazy! I can't wait until next time!

===================
I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it. 

It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.

Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a "vegetarian" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. "Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!" All I wanted was a simple "S-O-R-R-Y." Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed "Excuse me!" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.

A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. "Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say "I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? " I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked "Is everyone leaving here?" We said yes and continued to leave. "I don't like being insulted like that," my father told him. "Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.

We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! "You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!" Now, my father was mad. "I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with "A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. "Just don't end up in the ER!" my father said. 

I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place.

***Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a solid burger spot and a significant notch above the other celebrity chef-backed Las Vegas burger restaurant I've been to (Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Place)***

Burger restaurants (or maybe a sandwich spot like Earl of Sandwich) on The Strip might be your best option for a satisfying meal that does not cost you an outrageous amount of money.  A lot of the restaurants on The Strip (even the 24-hour cafes) charge a ridiculous amount of money ($30-$60) for just okay entrees.  With an upscale burger restaurant though, you are going to pay $10-$16 (maybe high but not outrageous) and get just as filling of a meal and maybe even a more satisfying one (since the total bill will not reach the fine dining-like prices of many Vegas restaurants--even casual ones).

I have not been to many of these Vegas burger spots (I hear Holsteins in The Cosmopolitan is popular).  I have been to Hubert Keller's Burger Bar, which is not too expensive but it is also not as good as it used to be.  This was my first visit to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR (located in Planet Hollywood) and it is relatively new.  The burger was good; hopefully, the quality does not go downhill as the restaurant ages.

Gordon Ramsay BurGR has a simple menu.  It ditches the build-a-burger concept (smart move since this often results in an abundance of mediocre ingredients); instead, Gordon Ramsay BurGR serves a little over 10 restaurant-designed burgers with many different types of flavors and ingredients as well as different patties (a lot of beef but also a portobello mushroom option, chicken burger and pork burger).  A few salads and typical bar and grill appetizers (like chicken wings and jalapeno poppers) are also available.  Various fries are offered in sharing size and there are also a few dessert-like shakes on the menu (that integrate cookies and puddings).

I had the chanterelle burger and it was good.  I really liked the bun.  The bun was soft, but it also had a distinct and toasted edge (so many upscale burger restaurants are putting burgers on grocery store-like buns).  The sandwich consisted of a thick eight-ounce beef patty, arugula, chanterelle mushrooms, and a sweet fig and onion jam.

The beef patty was great.  It had a good sear and a good flavor.  I ordered it medium rare and that is exactly what it was--some red in the center and very juicy.  I really liked the arugula and the sweetness of the jam was not too much.  The chanterelles were great, but there were not too many of them and this premium ingredient was kind of lost in the sandwich.  I think a good strong cheese would have made this burger better and there were parts of the burger that did feel a tad greasy.

I also tried their sticky toffee pudding push up pops for dessert.  It was a fun dessert--push up pops consisting of alternating layers of sticky toffee pudding and salted peanut ice cream.  The sticky toffee pudding layers were very thin and lacked the signature moistness and stickiness of that dessert (kind of expected given the structure of this dessert).  The sticky toffee pudding flavor was there though.  The salted peanut ice cream was creamy and not icy, but it really just tasted like vanilla ice cream.  Still, it was a fun dessert to eat.

Service was very good.  The hostesses and my server (Alex) were very friendly and attentive.  Alex was very passionate and eager to please (but in a very genuine way).  Service seemed organized and the food came out at a quick pace.

Gordon Ramsay BurGR has good lighting so that you can see what you are eating but not to the point where the restaurant is too bright.  It is a big and contemporary spot and quite loud (I am not sure about all the decorative live flames integrated into the restaurant; it is the kind of non-essential decoration that a lot of restaurants ditch later and then you are left with an odd, empty space).  Unfortunately, the restaurant sits open to the casino so depending on where you are sitting, the cigarette smoke from the gaming floor might be very disruptive to your dining experience.

Prices are good.  Burgers are in the $13-$16 range, but they are very filling and the flavors and preparation of the burgers are much better than a mediocre $40 steak at one of those 24-hour cafes on The Strip.  Total Rewards members also receive $1 off most items on the menu.

Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a great and not too expensive option for a satisfying and unique (but also not bank breaking) lunch or dinner on The Strip.  Hopefully, it does not fall into the trap of other celebrity chef-backed restaurants on The Strip where the quality standards drop as time goes on.

I have never parked here, but I imagine Planet Hollywood offers free self and valet parking like all the other major hotels and casinos on The Strip.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

"A feast worthy of Gods"

Baccarnal Buffet in Caesar Palace is consider the best buffet in the Las Vegas by most food critics   It rated highest in trip advisor and yelp for a buffet restaurant in Vegas.  I was only going to eat Buffet once in this trip, so I decided must try the best there is available.  My review is based on late breakfast and lunch during a non-holiday weekday.  Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip.  

Admission Price
*Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99
*Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99
* Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99
* Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends 
* Holiday expect to paid $10 more.
* Total Reward Card Holder gets $1 off.
* Price not included the 8.1% sales tax.

Atmosphere
The interior is similar to those of mid-level restaurant, they claim it cost 17 million that might not felt like it perhaps they included all the equipment and kitchen tools in to the cost.  There is a lot of seating, but do not count it those do not mean anything during dinner and weekend which can get full very quick.  The dessert section is separate counter from the rest of the food.

Customer Service
We got assign an individual server, at first she was helpful but quickly kind of forgot our table.  This was not during a weekday lunch so is not busy; there is was still several table empty.  Imagine in dinner or weekend, the service might be worst. The nicest thing is that they did not enforce the 2 hours eating time limit as they normally do in a busy time.   During peak hours, you would need to get an estimated waiting time in a kiosk machine, 

Beverage
You can to choose variety of juice and coffee.  Some yelper was right that the juice they serving were no longer freshly squeezed, but instead are concentrate and probably are pre-made package.  At this price tag, they should had keep the fresh juice instead of during the cheap way.  I was told that the Mexico Section would had fresh juice and Hocharta but never came out.

Breakfast
The item in the breakfast was the best part of the hot food section I think.  The typical American favorite food like Scramble Egg and Fried Chicken are just perfect in term of texture and flavor.  The dim sum was disappoint, it tasted like those cheap takeout place. 

Seafood
At this price they don't had crab leg for lunch, I heard Aria is the only in the strip serve cheaper.  I can settle with no crab leg as long the other item in the seafood make up for it.  However, it failed to impress me at all.  The got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, looks good but tasted plain.  Probably the worst jumbo shrimp I've tasted.  The oyster was small and wasn't much flavor either, lack freshness.  The smock salmon was not that great either, they got three version and all were no good.  Sushi was ok, I like the sushi rice it was authentic one, however the tuna wasn't good.  But salmon was alright.  There was no specialty or hand roll here.

Noodle Section
Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think.  They use pre-packed noodle, not even the good kind.  I try their Ramen, they use nissin kinds of noodle.  The broth was supposed to be Tonkotsu it tasted more like Shoyu.  There was tiny slice of chashu.  If they wanted to had this type of item, better get it right.  The pho was slight better but still no even close to the real Pho you can from any shop in L.A.

Meat Section
I tried their sausage and beef ribs, it was mediocre at best.  The person that cutting the meat is cool with smile.  There was no lamb chop for lunch, but they do serve prime ribs. The best food in the hot section were the sliders, those were mouthwatering.   I should had get more of those.  I think the burger were prime meat it was extreme flavorful.  Actually, it tasted better than the Gordon Ramsey Hell Burger, which later I eat that night.  The made to order taco wasn't good.  It tasted like king taco and other cheap taco place.

Dessert Section
They dessert has variety of food but nothing really won me over except one item.  Their made to order crepes were the best dessert easily. Fresh and with the right texture, I added the ice cream which was heavenly match.  Their Crme brle was too watery.

Fruit and Salad
They were pretty good in general, Large selection of salads.  You won't get disappoint here.  Just wish they were more fruits.

My 2 Cents
To be honest I am debating giving this 4 or 3 stars, I ended gave a four since there few dish were excellent and the best I had (Sliders, Crepes, Fried Chicken) .  But many other dish were average and even bad..  The price is the problem, they need to better quality and included more crab leg or lamb chop to worth the price.  I didn't get any food sickness after eating here over 2 hours which is a good sigh that the food is prepare it right.

===================
Yes, we hit all 7 buffets within a 24-hour period!  We can't say we ate full meals at each, and we can't say we really enjoyed the last few buffets.  But we did it, and we brag about it on a regular basis.

First, a note... my husband and I do not have an eating problem.  We only intended to hit 3 or 4 buffets.  You can get your money's worth doing that.  But once we got a couple under our belt, then it became a pride thing to complete the challenge.  So here's how we did it.

#1 - Caesar's
We started with lunch on Friday.  The food and the atmosphere is great here.  But considering the size of Caesar's, I was surprised by how small the buffet is.  It seems they go for quality over quantity, which is not always my preference.  There was a line to get in, so keep that in mind when planning.

#2 - Harrah's
We were walking by the casino, and there was no line.  So we went in to check out the options and ended up getting a second dessert.  There's not a lot of buffets where cotton candy is available.. it was a nice, light treat.

#3 - Imperial Palace
It's an older property, and the buffet is not much more than a small cafeteria.  We got a quick salad, and moved right along.

#4 - Flamingo
I did another dessert here.  Don't judge... I'm a sucker for a chocolate fountain!  And if you're walking the Strip, the Flamingo is right next to the Imperial Palace.  So it was easier to get some chocolate and then go to dinner, rather than back-track.

#5 - Paris
We had a nice dinner here.  Again, there was a line to get in.  But since we had already hit 4 buffets during the afternoon hours, having some extra time to digest didn't bother me.  There's some nicer high-end items at the Paris, but with a higher quantity than Caesar's.  So it was one of the best of the bunch.

#6 - Rio
We didn't wake up hungry on Saturday, but the Rio Carnival buffet has always been one of my favorites.  And on weekend mornings, mimosas are included.  So knowing the hard part was over, we gathered up what was left of our appetites and headed back towards the Strip.  We would have had a nice leisurely breakfast, if we didn't have to keep an eye on the clock.  But there was one more stop....

# 7 - Planet Hollywood
In retrospect, I wish we had done this one earlier.  I had never been before, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't stuffed myself over the past 23 hours.  There are some great international items, including fresh made naan.   Unfortunately, I only had a few bites before I told my husband it was time to go home and nap.

A final note... your 24 hours start when you purchase the first buffet.  The time will be noted on your receipt.  If you're in line when your time is up, too bad.  There are generally lines at Caesar's, Paris, Rio and Planet Hollywood... some of them can be up to an hour, if you go at a peak time.  So keep that in mind, if you want to hit all 7.

New listing?  New owner?  Not sure why it's "new," but in the end, it doesn't really matter.  I put my trust in you....wait, got sidetracked for a second....

How's the food???  THAT'S what matters to me!!

Well, as you might have guessed seeing the 5 star review, it's better than good in my book.  It was surprisingly good actually!

I ordered about 15 different kinds of Nigiri.  Not ONE of them were disappointing!  All tasted fresh, but here are some noteworthy ones to touch on :

Uni : Very good Uni! Love the consistency...not watery/runny or overly salty!  I am SUPER particular when it comes to uni...it's the difference between thoroughly enjoying it, or slightly gagging on it at first taste.  Thankfully, it's the former.

Hotate : The Fresh Scallops were PERFECT! Super tender, melt in your mouth good! Buttery, with just a hint of citrus and wasabi of course...only thing I have found to rival it ANYWHERE is YG&S's LIVE counterpart!  And considering that it's not FAIR to compare it, this is the best I've found LOL :P

Amaebi : The sweet shrimp had a slight crunch to it, buttery taste, and smooth finish.  Great choice.  I did not receive the fried heads...you probably need to specify if you want them.

The Hamachi Kama was on the daily special...this is my most favorite part of the fish!  If you see it on the menu and don't mind diggin in for the good stuff, you gotta try the collar if you have been sleeping under a rock!  If you've had it before, you are gonna order it without reading this anyways LOL.

And for dessert, both the Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Creme Brulee were on daily special.  If you see either on the menu, I would highly recommend both!  Chocolate mousse is a little thicker than their sister stores counterpart, but still that same great taste.  The creme brulee was perfect...strong green tea taste, and I love that crispy crust!

Service was very fast.  They were pretty slow on this Tuesday night, which got me worried about the quality I was to encounter, but I am glad it didn't affect my visit.  But because it was slow, my orders got taken promptly, food was prepared and served quickly, and I always had refills etc.

Only NEGATIVE thing I can think of...I got charged $3 for "sharing" with Little Foodie Dude.  He just turned two, and yes, he DOES have an appetite LOL, but it will mark forever in history as his first charge at an AYCE restaurant.  I'm not too mad though, considering he ate an entire order of Edamame, 4 pieces of unagi, ahi, salmon skin handroll etc lol.  He got his $3 worth :P

I hope it wasn't a fluke, but I much preferred my visit today than the last few times I have been to the Henderson location, as well as the G'monster himself!  All they need now is the Grilled Pork Belly and I'll never have to go back there again lol.

Keep it up Sushi-Mon...keep the ball rollin forward and never look back!

This is not a review but a love letter.  There are so many reasons to love centurion I have a hard time knowing where to start, so I guess I will just start at the beginning.  THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE AND WINE SELECTION WITH A SELECTION OF BEERS AND LIQUORS COMING SOON.

We walk up to a small restaurant within walking distance of the Central and Roosevelt Lightrail stop.  There are about 4 or 5 tables on the patio and about 10 tables inside with the tiniest open kitchen you have ever seen.  Seriously, the guy has 4 burners and a brick oven.  Not a whole lot to work with if you're a chef in my opinion.  The restaurant has a good neighborhood kind of feel.  It's not a kitschy overly modern place. Now I'll get to the best part of the restaurant, the food. 

We started with a Baked Brie with raspberry jam in a phylo pastry.  It was insanely inexpensive as an app that two could share for 7 bucks and the grapes that came with it were seriously some of the tastiest grapes I've ever had.  The Brie was had a nice strong flavor and was extremely tasty.  

Next I had the Taglioni with pulled duck, artichoke hearts, and leeks in garlic cream sauce.  The price for entre was 14 bucks and was an insane for the amount and quality food you get.   The flavors were incredible and here is my one wish for the meal.  I would have loved a nice thick noodle to hold up to the sauce a bit better.  The Taglioni is tasty and does well but I think something like a Pappardelle would have held up a bit better texturally.  The duck was cooked extremely well and was insanely tasty and the sauce was ridiculously good.  When I say ridiculously good, I mean ridiculously good.  I could sit with large bowls of that sauce and some bread and sop it up for a day and a half.  When our server Sean checked up on us I mentioned how I loved him for bringing me some crispy dusk skin with the meal and he comes back with even more.  This is about the point I fell in love with this restaurant.

Tiffany B had the Salami and Artichoke Pizza and I cannot describe how tasty it was.  This is my new pizza place hands down.  Forget Cibo, forget Pizzeria Bianco, go to Centurion for pizza.  They make pizza exactly like I like it.  The dough was delicious, not too salty like most doughs, and was airy and fluffy.  The sauce was sweet without being too sweet and all around flavorful.  It is extremely reasonably priced at 13 bucks for the pizza which makes me love the place even more.  

At this point we are late for our movie and are so in love with this place that a second bottle of wine and some dessert are in order.  The chef Eric Osbourn comes out and talks to us for a while and lets us know a bit about himself and the restaurant.  His goal is to bring gourmet foods in at an affordable price.  You can tell in talking to him that he serves things that he personally loves and that he loves food.  You don't get the feeling of a menu put together to maximize profit or to impress but to be as tasty as possible.  He is C.I.A. trained primarily as a pastry chef.  Ok seriously?  The rest of the food was so good and his specialty is desserts?  Sign me up.  After we talk to him for a while I tell him bring out whichever desserts we should have and a second bottle of wine.  He selects a sparkling wine for us and tells us he will be bringing out a trio of desserts for us to try.  

The first is a freshly baked Marscapone and Strawberry Phylo Pastry with Chocolate and Chili "Soup".  I am not a fan of chocolate but when the pastry was gone and there was chocolate left I started looking around the table for more things to dip in it.  The chilies were not overpowering at all but left a nice hint of spice.  Next we had a lemon sorbet, and a quince grenata with a raspberry puree, and a blueberry puree.  Both were good but the quince grenata with the blueberry puree was delicious beyond words.  Finally we had a chocolate flourless torte with, crme fresh, raspberry puree, and candied wine soaked quince.  The candied quince were sooo good.  I could eat a bowl of them with some crme fresh and be happy but add the chocolate torte and I was even happier.  

The entire meal (appetizer, pasta, pizza, 3 full desserts, and 2 bottles of wine) came in at a hundred bucks.  I got fast attentive service, from both Sean, who was an incredibly knowledgeable server, and Eric Osbourn, who is a fantastic chef.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.   This will absolutely be a regular haunt for me as it is by far the best restaurant value I have found in Phoenix.  The restaurant is open til 2 on the weekends which will also make this a late night post boozin it up spot.

Nourish is one of those places I recently found that I'm hesitant to share on Yelp because I selfishly don't want them to get so crowded that I'll have to wait for a table when I go... 

A friend of mine who lives in the Optima told me about "this new healthy restaurant that opened up" recently, and I couldn't wait to try it. Jared and I went in for dinner last Friday night and were both extremely pleased... we both loved the casual environment, friendly service, and of course the incredibly fresh and healthy food.  

We worked up an appetite by taking a bike ride prior to our visit and we were both starving when we arrived.  We pretty much ordered one of everything on the menu.  OK... that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but we did have the following:

1 x chunky sweet potato and avocado salad - (one of my favorite things that we tried)
1 x quinoa salad 
1 x confetti veggies of the day 
2 x seared sashimi-grade ahi tuna 
1 x salmon burger with peppered air-fried, no oil, sweet potato fries
1 x steamed teriyaki wild rice bowl with chicken
2 x flavored water of the day (it happened to be blackberry that night)

And as if that wasn't enough food for our first visit, we ended up purchasing two orders of quiche so we would have breakfast the next morning... and guess what? We finished everything we ordered and enjoyed it all!

To top off the experience, we got a chance to meet Kirstin, the owner, and she was extremely sweet.  She told us about how she came up with the idea for the restaurant and all of the planning and hard work that went into it.  Judging by our experience that night and the reviews so far, Kirstin's work is paying off... 

Jared actually went back for lunch today and I was jealous!  But I am excited to go back to "nourish" myself very soon.  

A few additional notes:
*There is a bar with plenty of outlets set up so bring your computer and have a working lunch... they've got WiFi too!
*There is a long list of wine, beer, and cocktails.
*Parking is kind of annoying... park underground and walk up.
*There is a dog friendly patio!
*They are closed on Mondays.
*They offer personalized healthy meal plans.
*Catering is also available.

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

***Bellagio has many iconic Las Vegas elements like the fountains, their seasonal gardens, the popular Cirque du Soleil show O, and high-end cuisine; these features make Bellagio a must visit to at least just take a look; however (on my visit), my room was not as nice as other upscale hotels I have stayed at on The Strip***

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

Being half Japanese & growing up in Japan I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi or any Japanese restaurant. Sushi on Rainbow did not disappoint. My friends indulged in my cravings and agreed to eat sushi. Not familiar with any sushi places in Vegas and one of the rare moments my friends have EVER asked me to jump on Yelp & find a place, I was stoked! Usually when I whip out my phone and start yelping it's amongst groans and moans from them. "Emy put the phone down!" "Seriously dude, do you have to yelp everything???" Sometimes I would Yelp while walking and a few times almost face planted into something. Though my friends were annoyed with my constant Yelping, they were nice enough to guide me while I was walking and typing. So yea, I was pretty happy they were turning to YELP for suggestions. 

This was my moment to either shine or worse - tank. Sushi on Rainbow was close to where we were at and the Yelp reviews were pretty good so I threw caution to the wind and announced, "I found the perfect place!". Fingers crossed and a silent prayer to the Yelp gods, we walk into SOR and was immediately greeted with "irrashaimase" in the right pronunciation...yeeesss, there is a Yelp god! 

It was AYCE sushi and other Japanese dishes such as tempura, fried oysters, curry rice, katsu etc. As some Yelpers have pointed out there is an hour time limit but this is common in Japan of any AYCE restaurant so this was not a big deal to me. I forgot how much it was per person but I did upload a couple of pics here that have the pricing on it. We all def ate and drank more than our money's worth in the allotted time.

The sushi we ordered came out relatively quickly and so did the non-sushi items. I was amazed at all the things they offer for AYCE! It was delish! The night we were there, beer, sake and soft drinks were also included in the AYCE eat. After establishing who the DD was (gotta be responsible ppl) we all ordered sake.  

The sushi chef's were very friendly and personable so were the waitresses. The sushi chefs would call out from time to time to ask us how we were doing. Like I said, very friendly. One of the waitresses was from my hometown in Japan and lived about 10 mins from me. It was fun talking to her in Japanese especially since my friends hardly ever hear me speak it. So yea, I got to bust out my Japanese...lol. 

Ok getting side tracked. I can't remember everything we ordered but the sushi was very fresh. I always start with hamachi (don't know what it's called in English) and it was very good. Salmon and maguro followed. Plus spicy tuna and a few speciality rolls. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, fried oysters and tonkatsu (pork cutlet). Yes, I'm a little oinker! 

One hour was plenty of time for us to fill our bellies on endless sushi and sake. Like I mentioned we hardly had to wait and the restaurant was a bit busy. The sushi counter was full when we got there and there were 3 tables that were occupied. The 2 sushi chefs both from Japan, were making the sushi and the cooks in the back were making the other dishes, 

This will be MUST GO TO restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Oh and btw, one of the sushi chefs was wearing a UH cap and told me they get lots of customers from Hawaii. 

As for converting my friends to Yelp that's another issue lol. I did score some big points on this once. (Fist pump!) Oh wait, I did convert one person, who just set up an account!

If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi & food this place is the place to go. I've been to other Japanese restaurants in Vegas that were highly recommended by locals only to be disappointed that it wasn't authentic. I mean come on, shrimp tempura is not panko crusted shrimp...that's called shrimp fry. 

So glad I found this place thanks to Yelp. 1 point Emy / 0 points friends who I will eventually convert to becoming Yelpers. Bwuahahaha

10 Steps to a Nice Date on the Strip...

Step #1:  Make a reservation to Giada De Laurentiis' new restaurant, GIADA.  GIADA is new and reservations are a must.  My suggestion, request a table with a view. 

Step #2:  Review the menu online.  You can also read the good, okay and bad reviews on Yelp.  GIADA's menu includes Italian dishes, with Giada's personal touches to them.  Menu consists of antipastas, soups, salads, pastas like Spah-geh-tee, ree-gah-TOH-neh, ree-ZOHT-oh, & Rah-VEEOH-lee, and main dishes like rib-eyes, salmon, chicken, rack of lamb, veal, and steak.  And let's not forget the sides...asparagus, potatoes, sweet corn, etc.

Step #3:  Arrive for your reservation.  GIADA is located in the Cromwell and their entrance is on Flamingo just east of Las Vegas Blvd.  I suggest valet at the Cromwell.  For those of you that wish to take a stroll through the Linq or walk off dinner, then park at the Ling.  

Step #4:  Check in and wait in their lobby's comfortable seating.  The lobby also sports a photo booth where you can take instant pictures.  These pictures can be printed on the spot (we didn't print our since the printer was busted), uploaded on Twitter, and/or uploaded to The Facebook.

Step #5:  Your hostess will take you to your table.  You server will arrive shortly for your drink order and of course, drop off some carbs (i.e. breads and spreads) and some of their $8 water.   You smell that?  Yup, it's fresh Las Vegas Strip air.  The restaurant has retractable windows (opened when we dined) and a good view of the strip.

Step #6:  Check out the menu one last time and make your decision.  For me, it was the Orzo Meatballs and Risotto (crab & scallops).  My beautiful date had the Spaghetti and Lobster Arancini.  

Step #7:  Enjoy the view.  That means phones down, no Yelping, no texting, and no Facebook.  My gf had a pretty good view of Caesar's and the Bellagio Fountains.  My view was the gf.  My thoughts....I had the best view. 

Step #8:  Food arrives and it's time to eat.  Okay, bring the phones back out for some pictures if you do that kinda thing.  To be frank, our food pictures are really unnecessary since almost every food photo is already posted on Yelp.  Just remember, there's only one original fork pic.  As for our meal, I loved mine and my gf's.  Yes, we tend to sample each other's dishes because that's what Yelpers do.  Everything tasted good, presentation was as good as it gets, and the portions were just right (enough that kept your satisfied, not too much that your belly couldn't afford dessert). 

Step #9:  Decide or have one of their Italian doughnuts, cookies, Tiramisu, gelato, or sorbets for dessert. We passed since we already had dessert lined up elsewhere

Step #10:  Repeat.  I look forward to trying their lunch next time. 

PS:  I have to mention the overall service at Giada.  5 Stars for the service here.  Our hostess and servers were great.  The Manager made multiple stops at our table to check on us and on the way out, he went out of his way to thank us for dining here.  Kudos, Giada!  So far, I'm a fan.

I have this horrible affliction where I have to go to new restaurants when they open, I'm  very impatient. And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. 

I'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. 

The Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. 

The Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. 

The Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. 

The Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). 

All in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.

Ahhhhhhhhhh. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.

That was going through my mind while we were trying to tough it out in the Herbal Steam Room. Let's rewind a little bit though. 

The Imperial Health Spa is definitely easy to miss! It is not located ON Sahara because you have to turn onto a little little street in order to get to it. Wherever your Maps tells you it is, turn into there. If it had not been for my best friend's guess, we would've missed that turn. I fancy that it's tucked away though.. like a guilty pleasure.

Upon walking in with my best friend, we were greeted by a nice, young man and he asked how he could help us. I informed him that we were looking to purchase day passes and then he started setting us up right away. He took my payment after giving us our pink shorts and shirts, wristbands, towels, and we also asked for slippers. Remember to ask them for some if you did not bring any! After that, he asked if we had been here before or if it was our first time and then he began explaining the process of their Korean spa. He pointed out where the razors and toothbrushes were near the desk and then told us to come back to the front if we needed extra towels. We thanked him and then went on our merry way into the Women's Spa Area. 

After we walked in, you cannot miss it, shoe lockers. Take your shoes off, put it in the number that coordinates with your wristband/key and throw your little slippers on. Walk more into the area and you will see lockers on the right hand side. These lockers are awesome. Stick your key in, turn it to the right, hear some whirring, and then it opens your locker. After you are done changing.. close your locker, twist the key to the left and remove. Keep this on your wrist at all times.

First things first. Walk into the vanity area and through the glass door. On your right hand side will be showers. Take a shower as this is the first of many to prep you for your day. If these showers are ever crowded, there are a few more passed the cold plunge. On the left are squat down showers and on the right are the normal, upright ones. After you shower, go about your spa journey.

There are three tubs: cold, warm, and hot. The Warm Tub is the biggest and also the only one with working jets. The rule is that you have to be completely nude in order to use the tubs. Strip off that bathing suit (if you had one on in the first place) and let yourself relax! We started with the warm tub to let ourselves begin to relax. After that, we showered. We then added cold water to our provided facial towels, wrung them, and made our way to the Herbal Steam Room. This one was fun, but boy was it hard to breathe without that towel on your face. What did we do after that? You guessed it. We showered. We went into the dry sauna and hung out in there for a bit before I started getting hungry. We showered off again and then put on our pink outfits to go upstairs to the coed area.

There was no one at the counter, but an instruction paper said to ring the bell and we did. A very sweet lady came out and took our order. It took about 10 minutes. I ordered the Ramen and my best friend ordered the Won Ton Soup. We both agreed that our food was delicious and they even cleaned up after you. You don't need money to order the food! They charge it to your locker number, and you pay for that at checkout. 

Red Clay Ball Room time! Luckily, we had brought our towels with us and laid them on top of the clay balls before we went in because those suckers were definitely warmed up! The pit is big enough for two people, but of course, laying together made us a little rambunctious. Luckily, the only other people in there were a couple who were talking and laughing loudly so they didn't seem to mind us. I did notice the "Quiet Area" sign. Whoops, sorry guys xP Also, the floor is hot! Be careful getting in and out. All of the amenities have signs next to them that advise you on how to properly and safely use their facilities. 

We entered the Red Clay Room with the red clay domes and attempted to relax, but we were again, too hyper. The floor's hot everywhere, yikes. We took a peek into the Jade Room, but didn't enter because the women in there seemed thoroughly relaxed while doing their bikram yoga and we didn't want to disturb them. We both agreed that we missed the Warm Tub so after taking a peek into the Salt Dry Sauna Room, we showered and went back into the Warm Tub. After that, we took a real shower with our own products and got ready in the Vanity Area. Definitely lots of space. Q-tips, Suave hair products, tissues, and hair dryers are provided.

Afterwards, drop everything that doesn't belong to you in the provided hampers if you haven't been doing so along the way, and then give your key back to the receptionist. Go about your night after a beautiful spa day!

THANK YOU to all of the Yelpers who wrote tips on their reviews about what to expect. It definitely prepared me for the experience!

I read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.

I posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs

The ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....

Since we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)

The launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.

You get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:

- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.

- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.

- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.

- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.

- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.

It sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.

The zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.

We were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.

After everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.

The ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.

After your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.

Overall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.

Will we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

You wouldn't know it if you saw me, but I'm a girl that can eat. I'm part Samoan so inside this 100 pound 5'2" frame lives a very large and in charge polynesian appetite. 

My BF and I have sworn off buffets but we made an exception during our trip to Las Vegas. It's not that I'm against all-you-can-eat food but I am against the mediocrity that most buffets offer. I'd rather have three bites of something amazing, than thirty bites of something which can best be described as "meh." But when in Vegas I feel as though having at least one buffet is just something you must do. Much like you must see the fountains at the Bellagio. Your trip just would not be complete without it! 

So after scanning the Yelp reviews we decided to go to the buffet at the Wynn. We went with three other friends and after waiting in line for about 10 minutes we were seated. My BF and I strategically planned to eat our weight in Alaskan King Crab legs. I personally feel like that's really the only way to get your money's worth. Eat the most expensive thing you can find until you throw up! I take that back, eat the most expensive thing until you can't even think of eating it for a solid week. 

I waited in line for the crab legs and they were pre-cracked which I thought was AWESOME! Less time cracking legs and more time eating! While waiting in line there was an old Chinese lady who tried to cut and I totally froze her out of the way with two plates and a bowl of butter. Hey, I don't care how old you are, there is no cutting when it comes to crab! She made as though she didn't speak English, but the language of cutting is Universal and that sneaky senior citizen knew exactly what she was doing. I might sound heartless but my own Grandma is totally crafty, so don't even play me woman. I see right thru you and your "Oh I didn't know'" fake liners! Back of the line Grannie!

My BF and I tore through four plates of crab legs and our friends were dumbfounded. When you have hot butter to dip into, anything is possible! I stood up and said "Now that I've got gout, I'm ready to move onto something else." I have to say that everything else I ate was pretty mediocre. How do you top crab legs? It just can't be done. I can say that you should stay away from the tom yum soup station. That stuff was rancid! 

We ended our buffet experience with the dessert station. They made candy apples, crepes, rice crispy treats, creme brulee, gelato, etc. It was great! I had them make me a crepe with peaches and chocolate which was not a 10 but a solid 7. It's a buffet, what do you expect? 

Would I do it again? 50/50 and it would totally depend on how big of a crab craving I had.

Dear Serendipity, 
You suck. 
Craig R. 

I had wanted to try their famous frozen chocolate drinks and massive sundaes for a long, long time. When I was in Vegas a few weeks ago, my group of four went to the restaurant at about 10:15pm on a Friday night. When I walked in there were many tables open in the main dining room and on the outdoor patio. When I asked how long the wait was for my party I was told forty minutes. I wasn't sure I heard the hostess correctly so I asked "I'm sorry, did you say forty minutes?" To my question the hostess rudely replied "YES, I DID. Just wait outside and we'll call you when we have a table available". Once outside we encountered a couple also waiting for a table and they said they had already been there twenty minutes and they had seen many diners leaving but they still had not been seated. 

After waiting about ten minutes (the couple still had not been called in) my group and I decided to just go to their walk up window. We ordered one large frozen peanut butter hot chocolate, one regular frozen hot chocolate and a chocolate cake sundae. The large frozen PBHC was huge and pretty damn tasty but I was so disappointed I didn't get to try it in one of their big glass mugs topped with mounds of whipped cream. The regular frozen HC was decent sized too and equally as tasty. Honestly though, I felt they charged too much for their to-go drinks. The price for the to-go drinks are the same as if you were to get them in the restaurant. Since you're not getting the true Serendipity experience I thought they'd at least cut back the $13 price tag for the large drink ($10 for the regular). 

The sundae wasn't very good. The piece of cake in the sundae seemed like it had been setting out a while. The cake itself was a tad stale and slightly crunchy. At least the guys running the to-go window were friendly. 

I'm still not sure why the wait was so long when they had so many open tables. I saw a bunch of servers when I was putting my name in so I don't think they were understaffed or anything like that. After looking over the many reviews on Yelp I see a lot of people complaining about the bad service they received. Maybe Serendipity thinks because they are so popular they can treat people like garbage because they will never be hurting for business. If that's the case, which I'm assuming it is, then they can take their big frozen hot chocolates and shove it up their behinds. 

Besides, Max Brenner is only five minutes away from here and I know from experience that they truly care about their customers and that their products, especially their shakes, are top notch. I wouldn't return to Serendipity's now if you paid me. They suck.

===================
After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.  

We showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.
  
After we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  "Whatever" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.
  
When we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.

After we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.  

I was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.  

When the waitress returned the first thing she said was "sorry we are all out of shrimp," this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.  

I think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.  

So we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.

When I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.
  
After we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.

Overall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening.

Thanks to the awesome review from my yelp buddy Nelson Q, I decided to bookmark this place and make it a point to stop here the next time the boyfriend and I are in town.

After figuring out where it was from where we were staying we put it off until the next day we would be in the general area. This place is not close to the Strip its a little past DTLV, but in my opinion, it's totally worth the drive to get some cheap yummy Mexican treats. The place is located in a small kind of run down business/shopping center. Do not let it scare you, it is safe as for what you find inside will totally be worth it! 

Walking in the first thing, I see is a couple of bags left of my precious snack that I have been longing for, Duroa de Harina with lime and chili salt (or in English wheat pinwheels ).

They also have helado (Mexican ice cream) that is made fresh in house; some of the flavors that I saw there were:

Fresa-Strawberry
Guayaba-Guava
Mango
Pina-Pineapple
Lime
Bubble Gum

and a bunch more that I could not see because not only is this place super small, but after 5:00pm on a weekday, this is the place to be after a hard day at work or school!

If you do order ice cream they offer a free topping as well, which is great! 

They have a nice selection of agua frescas (Horchata, Tamarind and Melon). 

If you are not wanting desert right away then they also have tacos and burritos too, which the boyfriend and I decided that we will have to try the next time we are in town!

They also have Smoothies, Tostilocos (one of my favorites) an assortment of Mexican candy as well!

Prices are amazing for a single scoop of ice cream and my bag of Duroa de Harina it came to under $8.00. 

Note: If you are not certain on how a flavor will taste you can try a sample of it. Everyone working there was very nice and helpful. The parking lot can be a bit of a zoo; we parked toward the end where there were a couple of extra spaces.

It was opening day so of course there were going to be issues. I knew that going in and it was pretty much what I expected -- wait times for slides ranged from 1-2 hours. But the park never felt that crowded, thanks to them closing the gates when they reached max capacity. 

It's a good thing I got there at 6:30 and another person in our party got there at 5:30. There was the expected rush to get in but most people in line were cool about it. We were some of the first hundred or so people in and had no problem snagging inner tubes (which you only need for the lazy river and maybe the wave pool) and lounge chairs.

Here's a quick rundown of positives and negatives from the first day:

Positives
+ Friendly staff. They didn't always know the answers to questions, but they always smiled and tried to be helpful. 
+ It was great that they had people manning the locker area and walking people how to rent a locker, find it and work it. Prices for lockers range from $8-12 and can be accessed throughout the day.
+ Slidin' Thru. The park food wasn't good, of course, so it was nice to see the Slidin' Thru Food truck set up in the back right corner of the park. Prices were higher than usual, but I can't fault them for making a good business decision. Let's hope we see more food trucks here in the future.
+ The main restrooms by the lockers have showers.

Negatives
- They ran out of food. By 1pm their cafe was out of almost everything. So I walked over to their buffet, purchased a wrist band for it and proceeded to wait almost 2.5 hours in line. That long wait was due to their buffet running out of food. They had to wait for a couple delivery trucks to drop off more food, then heat it/cook it. They only had hot dogs and pizza when I finally made it through. Typically I think they have salads and other options. But remember, this is a water park. Don't come here expecting Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon-quality food. Think high school cafeteria.
- Not enough rental tubes. This didn't effect me since we got the last of the rental ones. But there were lots of unhappy people left at the rental counter and at the lazy river. I guess they should have gotten there earlier.
- Poor signage at the cafe. There are separate lines to order food and pick up food. Make sure you're in the right ones.
- No outside food or drink is allowed. But you can bring in water bottles only if they're unopened (factory sealed)

Comments/Observations
- Buffet prices are $12.99 ($9.99 for kids and season ticket holders). They give you a wrist band and you can go through as often as you like throughout the day.
- Some families were only buying one buffet wristband and had that one family member go through and get food for everyone. One chick walked out with two plates of pizza, about 6 hot dogs and a few salads. haha
- There are only 30 or so cabanas for rent. You can rent them in advance for here on out. If you get a cabana you can also get food service. A great option if you want to avoid the long lines at the cafe.
- I didn't have problems with parking but if you can't get into the main lot there are plenty of dirt lots within walking distance to the park.
- For the majority of slides you have to wait in a line to get a tube/floaty, then head to a different line to wait for your turn on that slide. Some groups will split up -- one person will wait in the line to get a tube and another in the line for the slide. This will minimize their wait time because by the time the person gets the tube, the other person will be close to the front of the line for the slide. Some may think of this as cutting in line -- and as an old crabby dude, I would agree -- but congrats kids on thinking outside the box.
- There are plenty of grassy area to layout if you don't get a lounge chair, so feel free to bring blankets along with towels.
- I only went on 2 slides (the Rattler and Constrictor, both were fun) and the lazy river and wave pool. It's a good thing I prepped my kid ahead of time and told him he'd probably only go on a few slides, not all of them. It's important to set your kid's expectations to lessen the chance of a meltdown.

It wasn't a perfect opening day, but the most important thing is that my five year old walked away thinking it was loads of fun. Plus he was wiped out by 7pm. Despite some negatives  (mainly running out of food) it was a fun family day and Wet 'n' Wild is a long overdue addition to the community.

Grand Opening for PoshBurger today!

I had very high expectations...but I was pretty disappointed truthfully 

Little things like the Raw Juices not working yet is acceptable as initial growing pains....Them not having highchairs or boosters for my little foodie dude...borderline acceptable...these things will be fixed in due time.

But a medium rare burger should not be difficult to achieve...especially if it isn't busy out front! The first bite...a well done burger. I sent it back, with apologies from the server and a manager intro. The manager said she would personally check up on the next burger, and to make sure it was done correctly the second time around.  Kobe burger :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#4cJIHeKsw7583CsxztmIfw

First bite into the second burger...well done again. Are you serious? Well done, as in cooked 100% throughout. Not a hint of pink at all...the same as the first time. My company was already pretty much done with theirs, and we were running out of time, so I wasn't going to bother sending it back. The server checked on the second burger, saw it was overcooked again, and said she would get the manager.

Meals over...no manager. We get asked for dessert, we decline, and the check comes over....no manager, no discount, no mention about the poor cooking. I pay and get outta there...still no manager chasing me out the door to double check everything, especially being notified of the second time around. 

Keep in mind, this was a $30 hamburger. This is their top tier, most expensive plate they sell....they should be able to cook it right, especially after two tries. And for $30, I got meat that I couldn't tell was Kobe, Waygu, or Sirloin because it was overcooked. The foie gras was a sliver...about an inch wide, that didn't even cover half of the burger. Look closely for it :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#QGfHECw6fQR6tXecvIfUhg

The quail egg was great...but small of course. It covered the half of the burger that had no foie gras....It's a $30 burger!! I don't want a half/half burger, but I guess that is what they are going for. There other burgers are probably fine...just don't waste your money on their Kobe burger!

Also, one other small rant....the dips were way too small! We got one small glass bowl that was about halfway filled up...for each set of fry!  Pic of the fries :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#jU73XEy-7LnNiXZtTseeFw

I was afraid to ask for more, since it probably would have carried a $2 price tag, so I tried to spread the love out. Fill up the entire glass, or offer two with each fry!

The tuna tartar burger was good though! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#McfVnw8B3SzaAW9zcVPJVg

Very light and refreshing with the asian slaw and wasabi aioli!  I love wasabi, so I kind of wish they went heavier on it, but we know others wouldn't like it that way! The tuna was cooked well, and had a nice consistency...not falling apart or overcooked.

With all that being said, the Kobe burger itself was great tasting, just felt like it should have been a whole lot closer to $18-20 than the $30 price tag.  

I never mind spending good money for a good burger...but double the size of the foie gras to compete with the other gourmet burger spots in town, or you won't last long selling them for the same money.  The flavor IS there, just cook it correctly, and give your paying customers a fair amount of topping...we are paying enough money for it.

Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy. 

You know the one.

"If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober." 
 
Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock? 

And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you.

Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints.

You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better.

"Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh."

And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario.

You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro. 

One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread.

And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land.

Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus.

HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE!

And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries.

By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again.

You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you.

"Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously."
"Nah, man. I'm good."

WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite!

Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place.

Because they're all trying to get clean.

They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do.

It's not you. They're not turning YOU down.

They just know. They know because they've seen it happen.

One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again.

One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich.

It's just you and Lenny's now. 

You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone.

"Just come with me once. I'll pay for it."
"No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's."
"WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?"
"Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac."
"Fine...just this once."

Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese? 

Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out.

Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this "McBullshit" you're trying to feed it.

Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop. 

You are Bitch Numero Uno.

Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little "selling out" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes.

Now...would you like cheese with that?

Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food.

Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger.

"The restaurant is four days old, and already has five 5-star ratings? Hmm, must check it out," I thought.

Not so fast...

What I suspect we have here is a lot of the owner's friends creating 5-star reviews to bring in curious Yelpers like me.  (You can tell because they're very "promo-ey" and not so critical/constructive).

Let me give you the real deal, at this stage of the game.

* They're still 4 weeks away from a liquor license, thus no adult beverages to go with your tapas (unless you BYOB, which everyone around us did -apparently they got the memo). We could have used some of that awesome sangria from you-know-where.
* Seemed like they're suffering the same ethos that plagues many mom & pop restos -lots of friends and family hovering and trafficking in and out of the kitchen, like its an extension of their home kitchen. Kids running through the restaurant. Felt like we were imposing on a personal space, yet, we're paying customers. Awkward. 
* Had to request silverware, after the first appy arrived. We sat there looking at it, at each other, at it, scoured the surrounding tables to see if we could borrow a set, but nope. Eventually we flagged the hostess (co-owner)  who then brought a set. Then another set arrived a few minutes later from the server. A bit uncoordinated. 
* The water is unfiltered, so it was truly tap water from the best the Vegas pipes have to offer. Tastes terrible. 
* Dining partner had the muddled mint and strawberry lemonade. Tall thin glasses at $3.50 a pop. WIth ice, of course, so you'll be going through your drinks pretty darn quickly. My brother went through about six refills (which you do pay for). The hostess was nice and comped him one, I think because she knows that's a steep price for a tiny bit of actual beverage. 
* Cheese plate. $11 for tiny morsels of forgettable cheese! There was about $2 worth of cheese on the plate. Retitled, "Rip me Off Please Cheese Plate."
* Chicharrones. My brother is a chicharrones aficionado (he guiltily admits). He took one bite and didn't touch the rest of it. His assessment, "No. Just, no."
* Bucket of tempura veggies: edible along with the calamari. Hard to mess these up, but the calamari was comprised of super tiny rings. Lots of breading, not lots of calamari. Just kind of bummed at this point...
* Lastly, bro ordered the cookie baked in a mini skillet for dessert. It arrives, with a plastic spoon. Odd. I watch him fight to get the tiny plastic spoon through rock hard ice cream while also trying not to let the spoon melt when touching the scalding hot cast iron skillet. Humorous to watch, yet, ridiculous. I flag down the server, ask for a metal spoon. He looks at my bro and asks, "What's wrong with that spoon?" "I can't eat the ice cream with it -its frozen solid."  So what he brings us isa huge serving spoon meant for back of house. Jolly Green Gian spoon. 
Whatever. My good nature is on its last tempura crumb at this point.
* Asked for the check. Took 20 minutes... After check was paid (with hostess), we had the receipt with a large stack of bills sitting on the table. Server flys by and scoops up the stack of bills ($50).  "Whoa, cowboy, that's our change." Again, uncoordinated -I think they don't know who's doing what there, just yet. Server looked pretty young so maybe his first job while still in HS? Friend of the family, I'll bet... 

I keep saying to myself, ok, they're new. But lots of this stuff has nothing to do with new. Overall, not ready for prime time. And $50 later... feeling like I would have had a much better time, much better & filling food at Firefly. Everything on Nosh & Swig's menu can be had, in better quality, in their respective establishments around town. Leave the Korean to the Koreans, Japanese to the Japanese, White Trash to Simon, unless you can outshine them. Featuring variety is one thing, but variety without stellar quality = not coming back.

===================
I had decided that I was not giving in to the "Pig-themed" restaurants.  I mean "Pig", "Pork" and "Swine" restaurants are popping up everywhere!  But I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore P&P, it would pop-up on all of the foodie sites that I check around Phoenix.  So, for several months, I scoped this place out... checked out this restaurant online and with daily drive-bys in my daily commute.  I finally decided 2 months ago that I needed to check out P&P.  I was sold, food-whipped on my first visit and I've been every week since.  They source all their veggies locally.  They make as much as they can in house from the meats on the chacuterie tray to the pickled veggie/items that appear on every dish.  They even bake their own bread!  I fell in love y'all, with a Pig & Pickle.

This restaurant is in a nondescript strip of shops.  I could not tell you what stores exist adjacent to P&P.  It is off the well "beaten Scottsdale Rd" path, and yet, the food is exciting, relevant and has a depth of flavors that is unbelievable.  I'm a fan of P&P and once you give it a try, I think you will be too.

I have tried a few things on the menu, let me start with the crafted cocktails - pricey, but still yummy and worth every penny.  They carry premium spirits and they make just about everything that goes in those crafted drinks from scratch.  If you don't want to spend $12 per cocktail, they have a wonderful HH menu with $5 cocktails from 4-6pm. Satly Dog: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aG_8tn9ZxqvTDDwRB-tfhA#wshXHwfqyLloLxHV7g86eQ 


The star of P&P is the food.  I have tried several things on the menu and I'm happy to say that not one thing was even remotely disappointing.  Everything that I've been served there was 4 Stars and above.  My favorite item thus far was on the new brunch menu.  P&P started serving brunch this past Sunday.  After church, I stopped in and ordered the Bloody Sconnie and the Bacon, Andouille Sausage and Aisago Cheese Fratta.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=f-ez6J4BhI4U2Gk_Brvr7Q&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA  An extremely delicious dish that is really more like a crustless quiche.  This dish has a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) kick to it.  It is not for the people who can't handle spicy food.  This dish was excitingly delicious.  

My 2nd favorite was the braised pork belly http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=od8GMSNVUu4fAT3H1IoqcA&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA   The braised pork belly sat atop a delicious mound of mashed turnip bottoms.  The pork belly provided the right amount of saltiness that was balanced just right by the sweetness of the apple butter.  The arugula top the creation was just the right amount of earthiness to pair with the turnip bottoms.  I love all the flavors.  But as I told my mom, it was almost like eating a southern meal that contained ALL these ingredients, but prepared somewhat differently!    

During Happy Hour, they offer a chacuterie plate http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n62C4gnnQkajkiORQ-tpaw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA that is HUGE for the $5 that they charge!  In this pic, the chacuterie included bacon butter to spread on my homemade pretezel bread.  YUMMY... YUM is all I can say!  

To top it off, they have the nicest guys working behind the bar.  I mean... honestly, part of what makes my day when I go into a place like this are cute guys who can mix a drink and order up some food for me to eat.  Clayton and Scott are awesomely attentive and I just love sitting at their bar!  

My to try list (because I trust everything on their menu):
Shrimp and Grits
Braised Duck Leg
Croque Madame
Salmon Tot - 6/30/2013 - 4star. 
Pork Shoulder Tostadas

Each 3rd Monday of the Month, join them for Beer Dinner 6:30pm.  I'm hopeful they will have other events in the future.  I think their crafted cocktails would be a great thing to center an event around.

Oh gosh, they have free wi-fi too!

This is a gem in Scottsdale/Old Town.  Eat, Pig out and Enjoy!

Without Godzilla's review, I would totally not even known about this new restaurant called Koraku Ramen.  As I am not Japanese, not a subscriber to their phone tree or otherwise connected to the local Japanese social network scene.  So Hoodie, aka Godzilla X, thanks for bringing this new Japanese eatery to the attention of Yelp users.

Koraku Ramen, is a small chain restaurant from California (Little Tokyo and Sherman Oaks) that finally relocated their other Nevada location to Las Vegas.  So for those of you who have visited their other locations, you guys will probably be very familiar with their menu.  As for me, this is most likely the very first time I have ever been to one of their restaurants.  The LV branch is located in the same plaza as Krung Siam, Pho Little Saigon, Quiznos and Starbucks Coffee, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View.  Currently there is no signage indicating the name (or it was not put out on my first visit on Tuesday around 6pm) and unless you happened to read a little Japanese and can kinda sorta maybe translate the little "We're Open" sign near their front door, it will be hard to guess what kind of food they might serve.

The restaurant interior is pretty simply decorated, with a giant poster of an classic Japanese movie hanging above what looks like the exterior seating area of a ramen-ya in Japan.  There are additional smaller, classic Japanese movie posters on the wall, but you will have to tilt your head back to see them. Which is cool, because I enjoy watching old Japanese movies, and it kind of reminded me of the decor of the ramen museum (Yokohama, Japan) I visited with a a group of friends a few years back.  

Seats in the booth are surprisingly comfortable, thanks to the cushy cushions for our tushies.  It is the next best thing for our arse, than a pricier Derriere Facial.  Such thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.

The menu features entrees served with rice (such as various curries, katsu, sweet & sour pork meatballs), fried rice and noodles, and 1/3 of the menu dedicated to their diverse line up of ramen.  

Here are my impressions of the food I tried on my two visits (dinner and lunch):

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was mild but flavorful, not overly salty compared to most local ramen restaurants.  Chasu is nice, but could be even more tender and flavorful. Suggested add-ons:  Wakame, 3 slices of Chasu, and Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese flavored soft boiled egg).  (3.5/5)

Pork Fried Rice:  Simply prepared. Tasty.  (3.5/5)

Gyoza:  Nothing extraordinary, but prepared well.  Has nice crispy base, and is a good appetizer.  Server recommended that we eat it with the spicy oil (Ra-Yu). (3.5/5)

Beef Curry on Rice:  Decent.  (3/5)

Spicy House Special Ramen (mild):  Pretty good portion. A lot of ingredients, even without any add-ons.  Leosdianto L. commented that it kind of reminded him of ramen we make at home, and I agree.  (3.5/5)

Nikudango (Sweet & Sour Pork Meatballs):  The sauce seems to be on the salty side, but I didn't try this with rice.  Reminded me of meatballs on a skewer, without the pineapple and the stick.  (3/5)

Service (early dinner): We were the only there, so service was excellent.  The evening crew seems to be staff by mostly Japanese mothers.  They were very friendly, attentive, and food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. (4.5/5)

Service during the lunch rush (customers were overwhelmingly Japanese ex-pats, including local business owners and social gathering of house wives. When I closed my eyesand listen to their conversation, which I can't understand at all, it almost felt like I am in Japan without the cost of flight and hours on the plane) was friendly and attentive, but took the kitchen noticeably longer to serve up two bowls of ramen. (2.5/5)

Obviously the restaurant is very new, so it is super clean, and I expect that it will be maintained that way.

Parking. Not all that much (maybe 85) parking spaces in this tiny strip mall when it gets really busy. And there are no street parking in the immediate surrounding, being on the corner of two high traffic streets.  Big city dwellers will be used to that, for the rest be patient or walk a block or two.  (3/5)

Final thoughts. Koraku, once it has been opened for awhile and worked out most of the new restaurant kinks, it will be a respectable competition to other local Japanese restaurants that primarily serve ramen and curry.  Ramen combo deals (ramen + 1/2 order of fried rice or curry rice) is a good value for the Hungry-Man (R) and Hungry-Woman (patent registration pending).

P.S. It was great running into Mike C. and James I on my first visit.  Thanks for inviting me to join your party.  You guys are cool!

P.P.S.  Now accepting cash, credit and debit, gold and silver coins, and I.O.U.s from your pals.

3.5 stars.

I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place. 

I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she "needs a minute to move the table" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. 

Star removal #1.

We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?

Star removal #2.

We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. 

Star removal #3.

They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.

Star Removal #4

I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that "We can grat anyone we want" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.

Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.

P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. 

FAIL.

Went in for my first salon coloring!  (2009 was the first time I had my hair lightened.)  Parking lot was empty, but it was raining hard, so I wasn't surprised... Besides me, I think there may have been only one other client, back in the coffee/tea room.  Again, not a big deal, since I don't like crowds.  After checking in for my appointment, I was invited to sit down in the waiting area.  I found the wait pleasant- the area was tidy and cozy, and the music peaceful.  If you like to rummage through books and magazines, or look at hair and body products (and whatever else you may find for sale at salons), you won't have to look very hard here!  You'll find something to keep your mind busy, but I like to take the time to de-stress.  The receptionist offered something to drink, which is always nice!

After meeting up w/ my hairstylist/colorist, she showed me where to dress down to my comfort level and put on a robe.  Yes, it wasn't a plush robe, and it made me feel uncomfortable, as it wasn't very flattering, but no one was around to see me, anyway, so I didn't care :)  After finding my way back to my colorist, we discussed about the results I wanted to see and feel, and she then told me what procedures she would take me through and how long each phase would take.  I found her a good listener and felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  I'm not much for talking while at salons, and I sensed that she knew this, but when I would speak up and ask her questions, professionally and personally, she was open to talking, as well.   I found this refreshing, bec. I've met quite a few stylists throughout the years that act slighted or mad when I'd rather not talk...
 
The results were fantastic!  My stylist didn't lie- the products she used made my hair very shiny and silky to the touch (some things that were lost due to the color-stripping), and the fact that it took awhile (from a few hours to a few days!) for others to realize that I had colored my hair back to brunette (I had caramel, blonde, and red high- and low- lights) is testimony that the coloring looks natural!  (Actually, the color she gave me is the darkest I've ever had my hair- darker than my natural haircolor.)  Many people did comment on how much weight I've lost, which isn't fact, so I attribute all the compliments to my darker hair :)

Easier to access than Tempe's Moodswings (free parking!) and none of the snobbery one can find at other salons.  Less expensive than comparative salons, too!!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, comforting and welcoming ambience... Give Spa Lamar a try!

BTW, every first Wednesday of the month, Spa Lamar holds "Live at Lamar," a "happy hour" of sorts, from 6p to 9p there's live music, light apps (nothing fancy, just something from the grocery, I'm told), and perhaps cocktails.  MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, if you bring a friend who's never been to Spa Lamar, services are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!  That's right, you read correctly!  What are you doing this coming First Wednesday?  Hmm... I'm not sure, but I think something quite special is on the calendar...  Guess I'll catch this Spa Lamar special NEXT month!

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

The Noob's guide to a $20 massage at Bali!

If you guys reading this are like me, you would consider yourself very INEXPERIENCED when it comes to massages in general.  And of course, you've heard plenty of stories about the shady Asian Massage parlors in Vegas LOL.  

Since I am now an expert (jk only been one time lol), I will HELP you out and let you know what to expect!



1)  I showed up with no appointment, but was promptly welcomed and walked to the back.  Maybe during prime time, you might have to wait, but I had NO WAIT on a Thursday around 630pm.  Maybe if you enjoy a particular masseuse, you could schedule an appointment with that person, but since it was my first visit, I only showed up with a dumb look on my face lol.

2)  There are no upsells or uncomfortable requests for additional money.  There were no options, no choices.  No drinks or products to buy.  You walk in for a massage, and you drop a $20 bill on the table on the way out.  Simple and CHEAP...I like that!

3)  I was walked into the back into a large community room with tall cubical-like partitions set up  (BTW, there were places for me to CHARGE my phone).  It is very dark in there, but because it is not a private area, you should probably leave your clothes on, which brings me to my next point :

4)  Wear COMFORTABLE clothing.  I came in with a T-shirt, Jeans and tied tennis shoes, but I should have came in a tank top, shorts, and sandals.  They rub this very low scented lotion pretty much everywhere, so you don't want that crap on your good clothes, as well as them getting rolled up and wrinkled.  Your hair gets all messed up too...don't plan on going out lookin your best when you're finished.

5)  Once you get your area, take off your socks/shoes etc, and relax....maybe put your phone on silent.  My masseuse was there after about 5min with a bucket of hot water for my feet. 

6)  The massage itself : Probably depends on your masseuse for the most part.  Mine was a middle aged lady with a bit of meat on her, and was the perfect "STRENGTH" I needed.  I am a wuss...I don't need anyone breaking my back or gettin super deep-tissue on me, but if you do, ask for it!  As well as once you are on your chair...TELL EM if they need to go easy or harder on ya.

7)  Mine started off with my forehead, hair and scalp, temples, behind the ears (OMG YES!) and then to the neck.  Shoulders, arms and hands were next, to the feet/calves/thighs and then to the back.  I would imagine I could have asked for more or less time in any of the areas, and it would have been acceptable.

8)  My massage lasted about an hour and fifteen from sit down to leaving.  I never noticed her checking her watch, but she kept me BUSY pretty much the entire session.  I felt great right after the massage, and felt a lil beat up the next day.  Nothing crazy, just like a good workout at the gym.

9)  On the way out, she offered water and sat at a bench by the front door to get her tip I presume.  Drop your $20 bill at the front, and then your tip to your masseuse. 

10)  As for the TIP, that obviously depends on your masseuse, your overall experience, and your personal pocketbook.  I won't tell you what to pay, but my experience was wonderful, and I would have personally felt cheap droppin a $5 bill for an hour of hands on work.  I spent $10 and she seemed happy...maybe if it was enlightening, I would have tipped more, but for a great massage, I think $10 was fair.  Still at $30 that's crazy cheap!  I might come here once every week or two!



I know most of this is common sense to the seasoned veteran, but I can't be the only one that has been living under a rock!!

Hope some of this helped the fellow noob!  I know it would have helped me if I would have read this before my first visit :P

Now go get your $20 massage!

===================
Italian was my unofficial and official second major in college. I studied in Rome for three months and Florence for three months and went back several times after to experience the magic all over again. While I was there, I learned many things about Italian culture and solidified my language skills, but as you can imagine, the thing that I found the most exciting and educational was the Italians' relationship with food.  

Regardless of the region I was in, I found Italians united by shared beliefs about food preparation and eating, many of which were foreign to me prior to going. As an example, all the Italians I met took it as a given that: salad comes after a meal, not before it; fresh fruit is a dessert, not a snack or breakfast; alfredo sauce and mozzarella sticks are not Italian; alcohol exists to enhance the flavors of food, not to get drunk; and pepperoni is not thin slices of cured pork, but peppers - you know, the vegetables (this one blew my mind the most!). 

You get the idea. Of course, these guidelines come across to Americans as strict rules. We love our culinary freedom, and that makes sense - we have many different types of food, types of people, and types of lifestyles. Plus, Italian food changed a lot at the hands of the immigrants who came here. However, even if I'm not going to follow every guideline, I took from my experiences in Italy a sense of genuine appreciation for simple, fresh flavors, a desire to slow down and truly enjoy what I'm eating, and a greater awareness of the way that different dietary components come together to create a balanced diet and better internal functioning.

Since I got back, I've found few Italian restaurants that really embody these key principles, refusing to dumb down or speed up their food for the American masses. Well, Pizza A Metro is part of that elite category, and I'm thrilled to have found it here in Phoenix, just a short drive from our house. Maurizio makes it his goal to serve his customers fresh, simple, carefully-prepared food that allows the flavors of individual ingredients to shine. I appreciate that so much. 

We checked the place out for the first time last Friday night. We had made a reservation in advance, which was a great idea because we only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated once we arrived. We were promptly greeted by Maurizio and quickly had our drink order taken by the server. I was a little nervous about speaking Italian, since I'm pretty rusty, but I figured I should, since I haven't got many chances to do so in California, where I grew up, or here in Phoenix. So, when Maurizio returned with our bread basket and to take our order, I worked up my courage and ordered in Italian. Even though he was super-busy, Maurizio asked me a few questions back in Italian (where did I study, etc.) and continued to converse with us in Italian throughout the rest of the meal. It was so much fun for me to speak again, especially when the food was so delicious and really took me back to my study abroad time. 

We decided to start with the grilled calamari and then have the Penne Amatriciana and a medium Pizza Frescolina. The bread basket was phenomenal, with lightly oiled pieces of Italian flatbread with a cold mixture of eggplant, olives, and onions (almost like an Italian ratatouille). When the calamari arrived, we discovered that it was fried and not grilled (both are appetizer options; grilled is more prominent in Italy), but we decided not to say anything and eat it anyway. We were glad we did because it reminded me of the seafood "fritti misti" you get in Italy - just lightly battered with a hint of seasoning. It came with a tomato sauce, but it was delicious with just a squeeze of lemon. 

Our entrees were even more delicious. My pasta could have been a bit more al dente, probably because most Americans don't eat it that way, but no harm done - I'll just order it that way next time. The sauce was incredible and truly authentic. It perfectly combined fresh tomatoes, tender pieces of pancetta, onion, garlic, and olive oil without being too thick or sweet. The pizza was also to die-for with a thin, flour-brushed crust, small amounts of milky mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and arugula, and salty prosciutto. Just like Italian pies, all the flavors were balanced and no single one was overwhelming. So you know, the medium was huge and even with our huge appetite we ended up taking 3-4 slices home.

All in all, we only spent $30 or so and had an amazing, deeply satisfying meal that brought me back to my memorable time in Italy. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more things (and practice my Italian again!).

I almost don't want to write this review and be stingy with this special place, yet I want to also burst and tell someone "Hey, LISTEN!" 

We found our cigar home. This place is leaps and bounds above the rest and I can prove it. 

First, let me tell you the bad. Okay, it's in a industrial area between the strip and downtown. I don't care, but maybe some of you snoots do. This means cigarzens from areas not as lucky as us with stock can easily come here though. Second, is their hours are office hours. Mon- Fri, 10am - 6pm. This place really is their head offices that they decided, why not make a humidor and a place for people to hang out? Often I find places that don't "need" the business, but do it out of love do it best. They outfit several stores along the strip, have a co-ownership in Casa Fuente, own Rhumbar (also cigar friendly!), Tacos&Tequila, and soon will be opening more. 

So the humidor is pristine and one of the most meticulously cared for. I love the spacious layout, a few people can be in there and not have to maneuver around each other uncomfortably. Everything in it is lined up just so, not a stick out of place or damaged, no unattractive stacking of boxes and clutter everywhere as there is a secondary humidor for stock. Jason switches up the humidity based on the seasons and keeps it in the low to mid 60's which is the sweet spot really for longevity. The A/C system keeping the humidors going is its very own so nothing but clean air is getting in there. They have a advanced purification system for the water used which accounts for lack of a humid smell in there  but also so there isn't this "film" on items from using janky Vegas water to humidify. The blowers and system were picked for the way it could be maintained and control it from fluctuating. It kinda blew my mind to be explained the differences between systems and why they do it this way. I love when people go the extra mile for the better result. Here, it shows and it's a beautiful thing. 

Now the actual product.  I almost don't want to tell you what kind of rarities and gems pass through these doors so I won't name names, just that there can be some surprises.  If I find they keep running out of stock all of a sudden, I will find you and yell at you for being greedy. Please don't be hoarding 50 boxes of something super rare  just because you can bankroll it. Community respect, specially since I'm telling you a community secret. There is variety, but not ridiculous amounts - it's well curated. The kicker is the pricing. These are the best prices anywhere. I got a certain something something for cheap here that normally is jacked up due to it's rarity for under $20. I love the mentality here that just because it's rare doesn't mean it justifies being flipped for way above retail. The pricing is fair across the board, no matter what it is. The same cigar I saw at another store in town for $50.

I think it's clear we are fans of the dude that runs it, Jason. He's humble and easy going, but talk to him long enough and it'll be clear there isn't a cigar you can really stump him on. There is comfy seating so do stay and smoke. Bring your own drink, snack, etc. since you might be here a while.. Jason will probably chat you up, but there are always people in here passionate about cigars hanging out. If you want to meet people who are deep in the hobby, this would be the place. A lot of important people in the hospitality industry come to sit at these chairs as well on their lunch break. Even though theres always cigars going, it never gets to be thick with smoke nor reek of tobacco smell as its very well ventilated. You can even catch sports games since they always have the TV on, with the volume kept low. We sat there and I was comfy as I enjoyed my stogie. Sure, it's a office building essentially so not the well oiled digs of a swank looking cigar lounge, but the company and comfy vibe cannot be beat. It feels like hanging out at home, if you made your office into a cigar den.

I know we will be regulars, we absolutely love it here and will make this part of our day off ritual. Whether you want to smoke a cigar, but never have or a seasoned aficionado- this is a place that will please. Come find me, I'm sure we'll be here.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

It's places like Forequarter that make me wish "hipster chic" was a category on Yelp... really. It's so full of cool even the cuffed slim red pant and denim shirt unbuttoned like I just don't care I was wearing made me feel sort of lamesies in a sea of hip and happening. Seriously, everyone who eats there is hip. The bar is hip. The tables are hip. The plates are hip. It's hip that they have this fine-ish dining setup going but use paper napkins [1] and mismatched silverware [2]. It's hip that they make ice cream to order! [3] So hip I need to footnote this review, and that's hip. But don't fret if you don't sport swagger, the place is accessible for those that wear glasses because they have to and don flannel because it's practical. 

We arrived around 7 and were told it would be 30 minutes for a table. NBD, there are plenty of seats at the bar and a cocktail menu that'll take even the surest of imbibers time to get through. I landed on a delicious apple brandy cocktail that I snapped so you can see it and read all the deets. Just as soon as our drinks arrived, maybe 5 minutes after we arrived, a table opened up. And this folks is when ish gets real. 

Forequarter has a tidy menu of 12 or so items. They range in price from 4 to 17 bucks and all are meant to share. I think. I mean I get bored after two minutes of the same thing, so I think all dishes ought to be shared. We started with a charcuterie plate, a special that night which came with Genoa salami, two kinds of mustard, giardiniera, sliced bread and a fennel apple salad. It was amazing. I wish their was more bread to sandwich the plentiful amount of meat, but I knew we had more coming. Mushrooms were next, four kinds of wild fungus mixed with some greens and toasted bread... we'll call those croutons. ;) [4] Next up were the lamb meatballs served with perfectly cooked lima beans. What do I mean by perfectly cooked? I mean al dente; nice chew but not raw. From there we moved on to the squash cavatelli, the standout winner. Take a fun pasta, add some crispy pieces of squash, grated cheese and a fried egg and life is good. We rounded out our meal with a rich chocolate ice-cream that was pretty bomb for ice cream. It was served with a raspberry fruit leather and the best almond cookie I've ever eaten. Don't go there tomorrow for it. They rotate their desserts every night [3]. 

All in all it was an awesome trip and I'm excited to go back. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant and liked reading every option on the menu, and I can only guess as the weather cools, some warm and cozy things will find their way to Forequarter post fall. 

[1] I used to gripe about paper napkins and now I sort of feel like a. I'm wiping my mouth on the thing, do I care if it's cloth and b. I have to think it's much more green to go paper than to go cloth and use harsh solvents and water to clean. So I say viva paper. 

[2] My dessert spoon was just like a set we had growing up. I wanted to steal it, but then I thought, "I'd only have one!" Not "It's wrong to steal" but "what would I do with one?"

[3] How do you make ice-cream to order? Nitrogen. The base is made that day and contains egg, so it's more of a custard when it starts. An order comes in, nitrogen cools the custard and makes for a thick and creamy texture, and tada... delivered to your table is a cool creamy treat make seconds earlier. They aren't stuck with a bunch in the freezer at the end of the night like oh I dunno everywhere else that serves ice cream and keeps it on hand. And they can get through a base in a night (because it rocks) and swap in a new sweet treat nightly.

[4] It's ripped, it's toasted, it's bread. And their tongue and cheek play on Corey's favorite carb was noted. Bravo 4qtr.

After how many failed attempts, I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my "to try" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. 

Time to get our glutton on, that's what!

I always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.

There's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. 

Offering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!

I finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.

Ending this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. 

If there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, "My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   

Bottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.

Let me be truthful, I am comparing the Silver Dragon Chinese Restaurant(SDCR) to the last place(Dragon Chinese Restaurant...yes very similar name) that was in this very building less than a month ago in this review.   

My family and I saw some immediate changes as we walked into SDCR.  They have way more staff than the previous owners.  As you're seated they are at your table in a flash taking your drink order...good right!?   Less than a minute later you are smothered by the service!  I did not like that SDCR is doing everything it can to keep the presentation of the previous place.  Resembling business name, no change to the exterior nor the interior and identical menu with the exception of higher costs.  OK back to the review...a minute after getting the drinks we were confused from the sense of dj vu!  So we order an appetizer to give ourselves some time to get our bearings.  I kid you not, a second server approaches up within a minute of placing our APP order.  I am getting pissed and told the second waitress we're not ready and was really considering paying for the drinks and appetizer and getting out of Dodge!  The suspense of tasting a few of the regular items we used to order from Dragon Chinese Restaurant to see if SDCR could replicate kept us in our seats.  As we are discussing which items to get we kept hearing people arriving after us asking if this was the same place or asking for the previous employees.  The new crew had the mantra of, "we are owned by the same owner" and "we have better food".  Before the appetizer hits the table we were asked to place our order two more times since my last account.  We finally are placing our order as the APP hits the table.

We order Crab Puffs...they had the same appearance and taste, but the serving size went from 8 pieces to 6 pieces at a higher cost.  They brought our order of Chicken Fried Rice and it looked like it should have.  Again the portion shrunk, this time the flavor was off...way off.  I normally do not use soy sauce on my fried rice but this time it was needed because it was bland.  Along with the lack of flavor the peas and carrots were cool not completely cooked.  Next we have our Shrimp Chow Fun, can you guess if the trend will continue...yes smaller portions.  This is not a saucy dish and noodles are dry, I know this but the underside of the noodles were not coated with the sauce which made this dish under spiced too!  While we were eating we overheard a customer from the previous place give specific instructions with his add-ons along with what the previous restaurant charged for the add-ons.  My family and I got a kick out of this guy and chuckled.  My daughter said that the guy was her "spirit animal",kids say the funniest things sometimes.  

My family and I were very critical with SDCR because we REALLY LIKED Dragon Chinese Restaurant.  SDCR has lost our family's go to status.  Will we ever return, sure to see if they get better whenever in the area.  We will no longer make a special trip from Avondale to eat here.  If I did not compare it to one of my once favorite places, I would give it three stars.  At this point it is very average but it is also their first week being opened.

Mom and I arrived to find EG bustling during lunch (it was around 1:15 pm).  There were around ten tables of different shapes and numbers of chairs.  Our server Noreen was amiable and eager.  She took our orders of water and left us to look at the menus.  I didn't find the lamb entree Mom mentioned, and when I asked Noreen about it, she said that while it was only on the dinner menu, she could get the kitchen to cook it.  Mom balked at the price ($18.95), so we stuck with the lunch menus.  She wanted to try the Gyros (#6), which came with "Mom's Rice with toasted raisins and almonds, grilled bell peppers, onions and tomatoes."  (No pic taken- sorry!)  The menu also mentioned that fries came with the order, but Mom's entree came without it.  I unfortunately did not know, or I would've asked Noreen about it.  I ordered the Chicken lunch combo, which was a chicken pita and choice of side (salad or fries) and beverage for $7.95, as well as Mom's Favorite Appetizer Platter ("tabula, falafal, and potato cake"), $13.95.  

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXw#brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXw
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ#iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ

Mom enjoyed her meal!  She ooh'ed and ahh'ed over the rice (which I tried in spite of a rice allergy, and yes it was good), as well as the pita that the lamb and beef slices were served on.  She preferred it over the standard pita that came with the appetizer plate.  When she mentioned to Noreen that her pita tasted better than the other pita we had on the table, Noreen kind of leaned in and said it was made in-house and that they cost a $1 a piece.  I asked Mom to break off a tiny piece, and sure enough, it felt different (thicker, more doughy, and a bit greasy) and tasted fresh from the fryer, making the store-bought pita seem like cardboard.  I didn't like the greasy aftertaste, though, but I did appreciate the flavor of butter in the beginning and the pita's textures.  

I also enjoyed my chicken entree, which had juicy grilled chunks of chicken, strips of greens and tomato and onion slices (which I picked off before taking photos). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw#1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw  The "white sauce" was a nice accompaniment, although the chicken didn't need it.  Mom and I split the side salad- it was good, although I found the dressing to be too tart.  I enjoyed- tremendously, I might add- the potato cakes that came in the appetizer plate... Wow!  Am I glad I spotted that Yelper's tip to order them!  They're basically button-shaped croquettes filled with seasoned and juicy ground beef.  Definitely a must-try!  I also enjoyed the falafel, even if they were a bit on the dry side, and a bit harder-to-the-touch than other falafel balls I've tried.  The sauce it came with was too bitter.  The tabula was too tart!  I could only bear about three small forkfuls before walking to where Noreen was, standing behind a counter, to tell her about it, and that perhaps the kitchen should taste it and understand what I mean.  She offered to replace it with "homous," and I took her up on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg#E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg  It had a pleasant mouth-feel, but again, I found it a bit sour.  Noreen later came back to say that the I was right- the tabula was very sour, that it needed more parsley, and to thanked me for letting them know.  

Mom agreed with Su-Shien's review I read to her about size portions-- they were generous, and Mom likes generous servings, especially when they taste as good as her entree!  She wished she'd ask for more of the rice, instead of the homemade pita that we were sent home with, with an accompanying charge of $2.  I told her we could always go back for more...

Last, but not least, we had some baklava, two pcs., $4.  Mom and I split one- it was perfect!  Loved the buttery, toasted, and flaky crust, and the rich, walnut filling.  It was so good that I could've eaten the second piece in a heartbeat, but also so satisfying that I didn't feel the need to overdo it.  A great way to end a good meal.

I'd return back just to have more of those potato cakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ#6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ

A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSg

Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a "waiting area".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA

After about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the "bier garten".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.

SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.

Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.

As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an "Oom-pah-pah band"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbA
They starting with "roll out the barrel" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!

FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a "lemon martini" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly "disappeared" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!

DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the "sauerkraut cake" (A chocoholics dream!).

There are few things I can justify waiting in line for in Vegas. Good food is one of them. After a 45 minute wait in line, we definitely built up a big appetite. I was excited to try the Wynn buffet, especially after running into our friends who were on their way back from the Wynn. They managed to wake up at 9am on Sunday to head over there for brunch. I'm sorry, but I need at least 5 hours of sleep! One of the girls was eating a shiny red candied apple that looked so good. I couldn't believe she got it from the buffet. The Bellagio buffet didn't offer candied apples!

While waiting in line, cocktail waitresses actually came around with little bottles of water, which was greatly appreciated. It helped ease my growling stomach. This time, we decided to do the $30 regular brunch instead of the champagne or Bloody Mary brunch although it was only a few dollars more. 

The atrium was nicely lit but the only tables available for two was right by the entrance, so we decided to sit in the main dining area. The nice thing about this buffet was that each area had a sign above it, so it was easy to locate everything. Because when you're hungry and know what you want, you don't want to go around looking for it. 

I was really happy with the variety, including the Asian food selections, and the carving station had bacon as well as prime rib. My favorite, of course, was the dessert station which included a variety of homemade ice cream flavors and toppings. The chocolate chip bread pudding was amazing straight out of the oven. All other desserts were ok.

I was really impressed by our server, who was really attentive. Our friends had recommended that we have their hot chocolate, so I made sure to get a cup. It was so good, especially topped with whipped cream. 

The couple who we sat next to also raved about the Wynn buffet, telling us that they made it a point to dine there every time they were in town. They said their dinner buffet was better though, just as most buffets are. 

We walked out of there with Wynn buffet babies - we were so stuffed!

===================
I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw the photos that fellow yelper Shirley B. posted of her meals here.

They have a location on Lake Mead & Buffalo that is much closer to my house but, I noticed an event submitted by another yelper Jaime W., that they were opening this newer location and having a grand opening special where the whole day everyone got 50% off the whole total dine-in bill! How could I not help support a local business and take advantage of such a great discount?!?! The place was packed! I was so glad that we were even able to get a table. The wait for our food was almost an hour but we knew upon walking in that it was a mad house inside and wanted to wait it out. Staff came by to talk to us regularly. It was nice to see all the support this place was getting. Since I knew we were getting 50% off the whole bill I figured this was a good way to sample several things and see what I liked and didn't. Here it goes!

The "Chicago Deep Dish Cheese Pizza" was by far the best part of the meal. The sauce is sweet and super tasty. The crust is thick and crisp on the bottom and chewy in the middle. I would always order this! The sad part is they told us that they only make pizza at this Eastern location. The Lake Mead location makes hot dogs and sandwiches. We would make the drive to this Eastern location just for the pizza!

Next was the "Windy City's Chicago Style Hot Dog". This is a spot on Chicago dog people! We are talking a Vienna all beef hot dog with a steamed (makes such a difference in how the dog comes together) Vienna poppy seed bun, mustard, onion, green relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers and celery salt. The green relish is to die for! I recommend this for sure!

I wasn't impressed with the "Windy City's Chicago Style Italian Beef Sandwich". It had no flavor. If any of you have ever eaten at a "Portillo's" or "Al's Beef" in Chicago then you know what  good Italian beef is and this one here at WCBNP just doesn't cut it. I am willing to give this sandwich another try though since they were so busy maybe something was off and we did order multiple things. This sandwich was no reason not to give a 5 star review still because everything else was perfect.

We tried the "Windy City's Maxwell Polish" and I personally liked it. My man thought it was too charred on the outside but I like mine burnt! This one is a Vienna Polish sausage and you can get it plain or spicy, we chose spicy. They steam the sausage then grill it and serve it on a Vienna poppy seed muffin with mustard, grilled onions and sport peppers. 

I wanted to try their fries so I ordered the "Full Basket Of Chili Cheese Fries". I had them add onions. This was so good, but chili had an off flavor. Chili with no beans wasn't the issue. The fries were great. 

The place is clean and I noticed someone always wiping things down.

They serve beer and wine.

You can place an order for delivery! Call to find out if you are in the delivery area! They deliver up to 5 miles from WCBNP and charge $3.00 for delivery.

Check their website for monthly specials and coupons.

They do not accept personal checks or American Express. They do accept cash, visa, discover, and master card.

Outside is plenty of seating and in the middle of the seating is a peaceful sounding waterfall. So relaxing on a nice day I bet.

Lastly, go try this place!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Boy do we love our HHs down here in the SW!  Gone are the images of older septuagenerian and octogenarian hovering over a buffet line. In fact most HHs seem to have nice mixture of all ages, including those just getting off from work, unwinding before the start of the weekend. For us, it was just hitting the Yard House before the start of a movie at nearby Camelview Five. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Yard House is sort of a hip sports bar, with some really good food and lots of HDTVs. Don't be put off that the corporate parent is Darden, the same folk who own Olive Garden and Red Lobster. You'll need to remember, they also own The Capital Grille, Longhorn, Eddie V's, so they know how to make a fun and tasty experience. 

The restaurant is located in the breeze way, near the two entrances of the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and the valet parking area.  We sat outside in the patio area on this visit, even though it was in the low 80s. No one was rushing to get inside.  Did I mention we were sitting in the breezeway? LOL

MENU:
Unlike some, there are no special HH menu items offered by Yard House. Their HH prices are 50% off all appetizers and pizzas. These are actually the same size appetizers you would normally receive after 6 pm, so we were impressed. If you look at the photos, you'll see some really nice, mouth watering dishes. 

When you are seated, you are given a huge menu that includes also everything you ever could imagine.  The steaks and burgers are really good and everything is reasonably priced. http://www.yardhouse.com/files/food_menu_20.pdf 

The star at Yard House though is their nearly one hundred beers on tap. There are Heffes, Lagers, Pale Ales, Wheats, dark beers and so much more. If you like beer, this is your place. Nice!

SERVICE:
Our server Jon was excellent. He was also teamed with an equally good supporting cast that all worked well together. Granted Yard House was half full, but everyone was on top of their game.  It was something we appreciated as we looked at our watch, thinking about the movie next door. 

FOOD:
On this visit we ordered the Chicken Nachos (photo) that normally goes for $11.45 and their yummy Margherita Pizza, which comes with roasted garlic on it for $11.65. Both were outstanding and made us wish we could come back later for some more. 

On that topic, Yard House has what I call reverse HH with a special menu from 10 pm to close. On it you'll find such nom nom items as Black Truffle Cheeseburgers, Chilaquiles, Pastrami Dogs and something they call Monte Cristo Pops. Gosh do I enjoy truffle oil on things!  LOL

Yard House's food selection is almost as large as their beer selection.  I would guess you would need at least a dozen or so visits to try everything and I haven't even gotten to their Snacks menu. 

PRICES:
As noted, Happy Hour is 50% off all appetizers and pizza. Our bill came in around $23 including taxes but before gratuities. Jon was great, so we were very generous. 

So Four Stars and "yes, we're a Fan." 

Enjoy!

I appologize in advance for my long winded review. I tend to go into great detail when leaving 1 & 2 Star ratings out of fairness. Obviosuly there are mixed reviews on the SLS the following is my experience for my recent stay at SLS Casino 9/12/14-9/15/14

I was tempted to only give 1-Star but there were a couple positives which boosted my rating up to a 2-Star. Let me also say I really wanted to like this place. My friends and I all get comped rooms at a dozen casinos in Vegas but opted to pay for our rooms to check out this new Vegas destination. I have stayed at SLS Miami Beach and it was great...SLS Las Vegas not so much.

Let me start out by saying I am a Vegas regular, I visit Vegas 6-8 times a year and have been doing so for the past 10 years or so and have stayed at nearly every major, newer hotel/casino property on and off the strip. Let me also start out by saying SLS is nowhere on par with the ultra high-end Hotel/Casinos in Vegas such as Cosmopolitan or Wynn. Parts of the property looked very nice but other parts look like they just threw a coat of paint of the old Sahara stuff and called it new. Throw in the fact that the SLS far North Strip location is a long nearly $18-$20 cab ride to anywhere on the strip and it makes it even worse and the cab lines were slow because no cabs were coming to the SLS. Be prepared to wait in the cab lines and plan accordingly if you have reservations or headed to a show somehwere on the strip. 

My room looked nothing like the photo of the room shown on their website. Our room was small...tiny actually We were told the room would have 2 queen beds and it only had 2 small double beds. The mattress was uncomfortable and climate control in the room was terrible. We reserved 2 rooms on our reservastion and both rooms were tiny. Blinds/shades on the windows are terrible, they let in lots of light, it's Vegas, I want to party until 6:00am then sleep until noon in a dark room but that is not possible at the SLS. Room was clean but then again the SLS has only been open about 3 weeks so it should be clean. Housekeeping was good and prompt.

VIP services were terrible. We had a difficult time trying to reach someone to reserve a cabana at the pool but we finally got it taken care of after 4 phone calls...ughhh. Also had difficulty gettig ahold of someone in the cage or a casino host before my trip to get wire transfer info. I ended up just wiring my funds to another casnio where I already had an account...sorry, your loss SLS

On Saturday we got a cabana at the Foxtail pool which is the larger pool with more of a chill laid back vibe, very nice pool, one of the few high points of the property. Our cabana cost us $750 in food and beverage minimum purchase, however we ended up spending about $2000(our own doing). Sunday we did the Beach Life pool on the roof top above LIFE nightclub. Sunday is a slow day and we got a $550 min cabana. We had to walk up about 4 flights of stairs because the elevators were not working....really???  The rooftop pool is small and cramped, I would suggest the Foxtail pool over the Beach Life Pool.


The day we were at the Foxtail pool a VIP host approached us and asked if we wanted to go to LIFE Nightclub Saturday night. We were promised a $3000 table on the dance floor. When we arrived Saturday Night they tried upselling us telling us that the floor table would now cost us $5000-$6000. When I asked what table we would get for the $3000 they showed us a diagram of the club on his cell phone of a tiny table pushed of a couple tiers up from dance floor...Absolutley unacceptable so we headed to Marquee where we know exactly what we get for our money. 

Another high point of the SLS was my dining experience at Jose Andreas Bazaar Meats, I will be leaving a seperate review. There are also a couple of nice shops inside SLS, specifically Fred Segal shops. 

I will probably not return simply becuase there are MUCH better place in Vegas, the room rates are not on par with the quality and level of service offered by some other casinos in town. I feel we were mislead on the type of room  we reserved and their VIP nightlife services were terrible. The place left such a bad taste in my mouth I spent more time at and did more gambling at other properties( HRH and Cosmo) over the weekend than I did at the SLS. The only way I would even consider giving this place a second chance is if they comped my rooms for an entire weekend and since I did most of my play elsewhere(where I get comped rooms) that is unlikely.

Summary: Stay away unless you get a killer deal(like $100 per night weekend rate Max), advertised website rates are too high for level of service and quality. I think we paid $360 a night for a standard crappy room. For similar money you can get a great room at Cosmo I was expecting much more out of this place.

===================
I was in my Hometown for the Christmas celebration with my family. My Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Friday Night Fish Fry and gave us a couple of places that serve one. It wasn't hard for me to choose. Prairie Lanes was a place that I spent many hours at as a kid. The Bar & Grill part is all new & refurbished, so I wanted to see the new changes. Plus, I remember there not being a menu because of the limited options they had "back in the day". Now, they have a full menu to offer. We made plans to all meet up at 5:30. 

Prairie Lanes has ample parking all around and we found plenty of spots available. They have entrances on the North, South, and smack dab in the middle of the place. The best entrance for the Bar & Grill is the middle. You will find the Bar area immediately. There is a host stand, and they will find you a table or booth. We needed a table for 7 and there was no issue with that. We got a big round one right away. Getting settled in, our server stopped by asking about drinks. I don't think anyone of us knew what we wanted. She offered waters to us all, which we accepted. When she returned with the waters, only two of us had figured out what we wanted to drink. I asked about tap beers and our server grabbed a table tent off a booth to show me. She said she would be back with the two sodas that were asked for. Most choices seemed domestic on the tap list. Our server brought the sodas and started taking our food order at this time. In all, 3 AYCE Fish Fry's, one senior Fish Fry, and two kids meals. I also ordered a High Life on tap. The Fish Fry comes standard with Beer Battered Cod, Salad Bar, Soup Bar, & choice of potato. The choice of potato is French Fries, Baby Reds, or Potato Pancakes. I went with the Pancakes. Alyssa did Baby Reds. 

I checked out this Soup Bar first which is right next to the Salad Bar. They offered up 3 kinds of Soup. Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle, & Wisconsin Cheese. They also offer bowls & cups for dishing your Soup in. I grabbed a bowl of Clam Chowder and headed back to the table. Alyssa made her way up when I got back. I put a little pepper in my Chowder & dumped in the little packet of oyster crackers offered. Creamy, Hot & Fresh. But as Alyssa put it. It tastes like it came out a bag. It wasn't bad. Just....basic. I went up a second time to try the Chicken Noodle. I did a cup of it. The noodles are big and thick. The broth is flavorful. Hardly any chicken in it. Next up, Salad Bar. This is surprisingly solid. They have all the bases covered on this one. Everything was fresh & full. They had an attendant right there monitoring it. Coleslaw is available here, too.  It's something that I didn't try. 

I was a couple of bites into my salad when our dinners arrived. The Fish looked good. Two pieces of Golden Fried Beer Battered Cod. The Potato Pancakes not so much so. When I think of Potato Pancakes, these I didn't have in mind. They were little McDonald's like Hash Browns. Or Larger Burger King like Hash Rounds. Take your pick. Tasted like 'em, too. Straight out the freezer. Slid out the bag. Into the fryer. They tried to make them authentic by providing Applesauce & Syrup to dip them into. The Baby Reds Alyssa got were nice. They looked pan fried. The Cod Loins were cooked too much. Cutting in, they clumped instead of flaked away. Biting down, you knew it. Firm. Not tender. It's one of those thing where it's not bad, just not good. Seeming that they only offer one kind of Cod, Deep Fried. They should be able to handle cooking it the right time. Ah well. There's always the reorder, right? Those were overcooked as well. Not burned, just over done. By 2 or 3 minutes. When I mentioned this later, everyone who ordered Fish thought the same thing. I had to ask for lemon, as for that didn't come with the supper, but tartar sauce did. It tasted fine, just seemed like it came out the bottle.

Our server was so very patient with us. When we were indecisive of drinks, she didn't blink an eye. She was always checking up on us. Awesome job by her. The AYCE Friday Night Fish Fry costs $11.99 here. Could be worth it, if the Cod is cooked proper. For what we got, it's a little steep. The menu here is nice. They have a burger that me, living in the Twin Cities, was surprised to see. The Juicy Lucy. While it might not be the way I'd spell it (Jucy Lucy), it sure was a welcome to see. I tried to get someone at the table to order one, to no avail. Probably a good thing. I'll take 'em out for an authentic one when they come to visit us.

What a shame as my first review was a well deserved 5 Star rating!

Oh Sammy baby...what has happened to you?

I had been bragging to my boyfriend who is a big fan of anything Pastrami so we finally had the time to stop by and get our grub on...eh hem I mean attempt to.

We walk up and place our order for two LA style pastrami sandwiches, order of garlic fries and a large soda. He says $30 dollars as I am handing him my two for one coupon he says "ugh" then says OK $20 dollars. Yes I shit you not he actually groaned "UGH" after presenting him with their coupon.

Anyhow, I have a bad feeling from the start. This guy is sweating buckets, he is blinded by the sweat in his eyes that he drops our cup on the dirty ground and picks it up and fills it. Wow! He hands us our drink and says 20 minutes. 

He did not bother washing his hands after just handling our money as he begins throwing stuff on the grill for the order that is before ours.This guy clearly did not want to be here working that is for sure!

We go and stand on the side of the building where the door to the kitchen is open, bad mistake as my bf started to add up all of the health violations. 

I was embarrassed as my experience picking up food here previously was a world of difference. Where was the mature sweet couple who was smiles behind the counter at? The people that were so full of life and excited to explain and suggest menu items? They are a thing of the past I suppose? :(

I swear we waited 10 minutes and still our order had not been started and at that point all I could think of was how bad this guy needs a shower and how I will throw up if I see him touch my food with his bare hands after seeing him break health code upon health code violation.

The kitchen was disgusting and not once did we see this guy wash his hands. His behavior was odd as well, he clearly was angered at having to work it seemed as he was slamming stuff around in the kitchen. 

We waited...waited...waited....and then I was to the point of just flat out disgusted so I walked right up to him and said I would like my money back as we have decided not to dine here. He said "how much you give me"? I replied 20.00 he reached into his pocket and gave me 20.00 and that was that nothing else said. He actually seemed happy that he did not have to bother with making our order.

The end...

What a disappointment, not sure if they sold the business or what however I can tell you this is the beginning of the end for them if this keeps up!

I will never be back in fact you could not pay me to come back to this hot mess of a once great operation!!!


So sad...

===================
I'm accustomed to staying in hotels like the Excalibur, Luxor and Sahara.  Hotels that have the lowest rates online, but also provide me with a pretty low budget weekend, and allow me to be the cheap bitch that I am.  Hotels where there ARE $5 tables, and fast food courts, and cramped living space.  This past weekend, I lived like a queen.  None of that classless, cheap stuff in our hotel..no way.  Maybe it was more like living like THE queen of potential kink, debauchery, shark tanks,  tiny clothes and mango-ey goodness, but THE queen none-the-less.

THE Queen of potential kink- This title goes to THE living quarters as a whole and what we managed to do to them. THEHotel consists of all suites.  Two rooms make for room for many, and we definitely took advantage of that.  We had a pile of people in the living area on Saturday night, and a full bedroom as well, making for an interesting picture for any stranger that was to be an outside observer.  Couch with three, Air mattress with two, two on the floor, five in the bedroom, and who knows where everyones hands were.  All the bedrooms also have mirrors on the closets and walls next to the bed which could add a very entertaining aspect to bedroom happenings.  The bathroom has a pretty large tub, with a clear shower next to it, so you could watch someone bathing while showering if that is what you are into.  There is also a television in every room except the guest bathroom, so you could order 24 hour porn and have it follow you around the rooms.  A phone in the main toilet area also could allow for some interesting conversations with those people in the bedroom or living area.

THE Queen of debauchery- do i really need to explain this one?  We were in Vegas.  We were the "smoking room". THEHotel provided us with THEMix, the nightclub, and between the shot of tequila I took at THEBar, and the other stuff I ingested within all of our other rooms, sobriety was barely an option.  I didn't break anything, although a few of us almost started THEfire, in THEtrashcans downstairs in THEarea where we weren't supposed to be smoking.

THE Queen of shark tanks- When telling someone that we had a shark tank in our room, it evolved into this whole conversation about how sharks were difficult roommates, and having a room filled with chum was pretty gross and hard to deal with...but in reality all I meant was that we had a channel on the television that was a 24 hour view of the Shark Exhibit at Mandalay.  If sharks and fish tanks are what you are into...this was definitely the most entertaining channel on the TV.

THE Queen of tiny clothes- if only there was a reason to wear the clothes i wore this weekend in Vegas in everyday life in SF.  Everyone I saw in small outfits or dresses, I would follow up by saying, man...that dress sure would be cute over jeans.  Cuz that's how we roll in SF.  Not in Vegas though.  Somewhat modest Lauren, actually showed ALOT of skin this past weekend.  I needed to feel like I fit in to the Vegas culture, and specifically the type of people who were staying at THEHotel.  Classy though...not trashy.  Cuz THEHotel was all class.

THE Queen of mango-ey goodness- So, this story started off at home in SF when I decided to be a good resident in my room and bring a very large bottle of Mango flavored vodka to share in Vegas.  Pack it up in towels so it doesn't break, and check my bag.  I arrive at the hotel, only to realize that my backpack is completely soaked, and that there is only an inch of vodka left in the bottle.  NOTE TO SELF: Don't pack a bottle that has been opened.  EVER.  I start to freak out.  I get to my room, explode my bag, and realize that everything smells like Mango.  Could have been worse, and smelled like Absolut Peppar, but I definitely still start to worry.  I take out my NEW green dress, my NEW white halter, and my NEW multi colored halter, only to realize that those three NEW items are the only ones affected by this ordeal.  Of course. Everything smells, but the unwashed new green dress bled onto the white halter and the other one is just covered in filth.  SHIT!  I managed not to over-pack this weekend.  I only packed outfits...and I have no other outfits for my evenings, and I love that halter that i haven't worn yet and now its no longer white...its green.  I use THElaundry service.  I call THEbell desk, and give them my clothes around 3 o'clock Friday.  They were delivered in near perfect condition by 6 o'clock Saturday, and with the exception of the halter having a *hint* of green that you could barely see, I was super pleased at the work that the hotel did.  

THEHotel provided all sorts of services to us.  We ordered room service, and even though they couldn't deliver the partridge in a pear tree that we ordered, the hospitality I felt at this hotel was perfect.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  After all I am THE Queen...it would be expected.

3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan of Vegas. I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris.
 
However, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:

- Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA 

- Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ 

- No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.

- Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. 

You would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?

- The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. 

The saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg 
 
At least I can say I've dined here. Would I come here again? No.

Ok so I'm watching Top Chef Masters in Las Vegas, and all the masters are treated to a dinner at Lotus of Siam for a "lesson" in authentic Thai cooking.  It's very clear that all these chefs are blown away by every dish at the table, so before the show was even over I was bookmarking Lotus of Siam on yelp for a future trip.  It helped even more, when I booked a Vegas trip with a friend and the first thing out of his mouth was, "We must eat at Lotus of Siam."

My advice is to explore the menu in advance, there are so many wonderful sounding dishes, that you can be overwhelmed if you wait until you sit down.  So get a game plan in order because there are 167 dishes on the menu.  We heard the Northern Thai dishes are very special here and you don't get them in most Thai restaurants in the US.  First up was the Sai Oua - Northern Sausage.  This was a pork sausage with some kick to it.  I liked pairing it with some of the crunchy veggies on the plate for some contrast and it also mellowed out the spice a bit.  We were going to compare this with an order of the Issan Sausage, but our waiter told us not to bother, since it would be no contest. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#rJOafb9EviIxvHmuRImkTA

Nam Prik Ong was featured once on "The best thing I ever ate".  So you know I had to try it.  It's a very tasty Northern ground pork based red chili tomato sauce dip and not very spicy, but packed full of flavor.  It's served with all kinds of crunchy veggies to spread on as well as a few pork rinds.  I will most likely order this every time I go back.  Works well as an appetizer and unique to this restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#w0R40SdZ1M2T6vi_nL7ioQ

A yelper friend of mine, Anita L., bragged about the Nua Nam Tok.  Our waiter warned us that this was a cold dish as some people are surprised.  Well it wasn't actually served cold, but slightly warm at room temperature.  The beef is coated in rice powder which gives it an unusual texture.  The flavor of the sauce was very strong and similar to a Nam Sod, heavy on the lime flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#QwdrDHXlRPQY1CXH6XvNQA

We felt obligated to get a few standard Thai dishes as a place of reference.  Tom Kah  Kai is a soup that most people are very familiar with.  Lotus of Siam's version was very spicy and if you slurp it up the wrong way, it will get your eyes watering.  I love spicy, so no problems with me.  What I liked about this version was that the lemongrass flavor wasn't lost in the coconut milk at all. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#YZAR3oSugi4fd6bammVMzg

My buddy loves Pad Thai (as most people do).  I'm not that fond of the dish, but I will say I'm glad that I got to try it here.  Perhaps I've had so many bad versions of it, that I'm jaded.  This was by far the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.  I would order it again in a second.  We had it with Chicken. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#9UnnMrrfaKk53Uuv-pPyuQ

Last up was a Green Curry with Beef.  I love green curry and I love it spicy.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10.  I went with a 8.  Lke most things in Vegas; it was fun at the time, but I paid dearly for it the next morning.  It was very spicy and whatever they spiced it up with was green, because other places I've seen all kinds of ground up red chili in there, not in this curry.  Glad I had plenty of rice to soak up this delicious sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#tQBHtC3JR05nKHCMFp-PaA  

Yes Lotus of Siam, should be on your must do list of Vegas.  I would make reservations, as it gets crowded.  We were seated promptly at our 8:30 reservation time on a Friday night.  Others who didn't think ahead had to wait.  The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside and has most likely expanded a few times, taking over their former next door neighbors.  Taking a large group here would be great as you can sample many dishes, as a true food tourist should.

Best... Steak... EVER!!

That's it. Those three simple words sum up my experience this evening. Oh, you want more?! Okay!!

Upon entering the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino on my rez.. the Gila River Indian Community, one can find new slot machines, a lounge with waterfalls that can make someone drunk just from staring at it, fresh clean(ish) air... and my favorite amenity... the Verona Steakhouse!!

Entering the nice clean and dare I say it... swanky Chophouse Steakhouse... is both casual and fine dining. Grandma's in their Blue Light special tunics and oxygen tanks sit enjoying enormous Cesar salads that was made table side (!) by well trained servers. I looooove the decor! I small found small touches that reminded me of home, the tortoise shell ceiling that melded traditional Pima basket designs with Italian decals, interesting. 

There's a nice mural and huge windows that with Cafe 24/7 encircle a very beautiful fountain. (I'm assuming this is to recreate a whirlwind design, which is a well known symbol to my tribe, "all crazy times are a whirlwind" - Pima proverb) If you're dining indoors, especially in the day time its very nice to have these huge windows, I kinda wished we were sitting by one of them! 

Our server Jessica presented us with some bread and made a dipping sauce made with Bellagio olive oil, balsamic vinegar, freshly grated parm and cracked pepper. Lovely. I couldn't get enough!

I ordered the 12oz Rib eye with Squash w/pancetta for $25. I was very specific with my steak. I ordered it pan-roasted to medium and finished with butter, served with a side of blue cheese. And I got it medium and grilled on the salamander. I was disappointed when it first hit the table, and then I took a bit... oh em.. gee!!! 

Never, EVER - have I had a steak THIS good!! Tender, perfectly chard, flavorful, beautifully seasoned and well rested. The sign of any great steakhouse is in how well they rest their steaks before serving. I couldn't believe it was so amazing... but I can't help but to wonder how it would have been if I got it the way I wanted it! I also can't help but to wonder if the chefs in the back knew better than me! I did tell the server that the order was wrong... but that I was happy and didn't need to have it fixed or replaced. She was relieved and waited on us hand and foot afterward. 

My mom got the Special. An 8oz Filet Mingon with asparagus, roasted potatoes and eggplant ragu for $27! She ordered it well done! (ARGH! I know I know... ugh, some ppl! :P) But it was very good... even if they ruined it to her specifications! 

We ate to our hearts content and walked away very happy with our meal. I ran into my biological mom (long story) and her husband celebrating their wedding anniversary, I told the waiter and he hooked them up with a free dessert! How awesome is that?! The manager walked the front of the house asking everyone (including us) how our meals were going. They pay attention to the small details, which is something I notice and appreciate. 

I may not be able to afford it ALL the time... but I will DEFINATLY be back with MANY more in tow!! I wish they were open 24 hours like the other restaurant at the Casino, but alas - they have lunch and dinner service only. To my yelpers, I say... GO, GO NOW!! What are you waiting for?! I don't care if you're not in the area... GO! Its not THAT expensive... quit crying! :P Go and enjoy yourself!! Try some wine and give the Cesar salad that's prepared table side! And don't forget the cannoli! I hear it's yummy! And be sure to play a few slots on your way out! ;)

Where to go for a good breakfast after a red-eye flight to Vegas? Try "eat." in downtown Vegas. Unusual name, yes, highly recommended!

Located on the 1st floor of an apartment building at the corner of Carson St. & 7th St., "eat." is a casual & trendy restaurant known for its upscale American breakfast/lunch entrees w/ southern & New Mexican touches, while using quality & locally sourced products. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=sloCm07roLTYRRVg5PHCJQ 

During a recent Vegas trip during Spring break, my son & I had our 1st meal in Vegas - breakfast at eat. on a weekday mid-morning.  Our entrees were delicious, & the presentations were eye-catching. We had the following:

- Golden-brown pancakes w/ chicken-apple sausage ($9). This order came w/ thick pancakes w/ a grilled chicken-apple sausage sliced down the middle & garnished w/ powdered sugar & a strawberry sliced in half. The pancakes, crispy at the edges & so fluffy & soft on the inside, were perfectly done.  They were so delicious & were the best that I've tasted! They came w/ butter & cute little sealed jars of 100% maple syrup from Vermont, instead of the sticky tabletop syrup dispensers; the pancakes were so flavorful that you really didn't need to use that much syrup. The entre is so generous that I could not finish it; next time, I'll just have a side order of one pancake to satisfy my craving & try another entre. The full order would have been good to share amongst a group of people. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=d371vDGyCTtrV47Wfezxig 

- DWBLTA w/ fresh made-from-scratch tomato soup & pickle ($11). This sandwich is their version of a BLT consisting of smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado w/ chipotle mayo on buttery toasted sourdough.  (DW stands for Don Welch, who is one of the restaurant's investors.) I was impressed w/ the thick slices of smoked bacon & avocado, which made the sandwich very creamy & savory; the ingredients complemented each other very well. The tomato soup was very flavorful.  This entre is a winner! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=KfcNl_Zk82sijLfZcCy5Rw 

We chose the above two entrees based on the resounding comments posted in other Yelp reviews. They also have other popular dishes which we will try  the next time:  chicken fried steak, shrimp & grits, beignets, huevos motulenos, eggs done in different ways, salads, many types of sandwiches (roast beef, chicken, grilled cheese, veggie burger, Rueben, shrimp), & freshly made chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=HaumAEuf9JqmIJP_lQej4g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=epkj9L81E8G3DUDyjjNq5A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xKU896f0iS1uFBqYkSFEgg 

Service was very attentive, as the servers, in their signature black attire, ensured that our orders came quickly, dirty dishes taken away promptly, water glasses refilled regularly,& periodic checking in assuring that everything was okay. In fact, I found out afterwards that chef/owner Natalie Young will appear in the dining room & converse w/ diners to get feedback in improving her operation (I don't recall if she did talk to us, as I didn't know who she was at that time.)

The restaurant seats about 60 people. The interior is full of charm w/ a mixture of brick & green walls & a cemented floor. The walls are adorned w/ artwork of local artists.  There are orange metal chairs made from recycled materials, partial booths of a green color, tables, & a bar counter facing an open kitchen. Fabric napkins are used. Cute recyclable boxes are used for doggie bags. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=zsaULVQQOqXcBg4WOb7eBA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=4Pp0OeG2PEltnI1XhuvK-Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=1XAw57xgR3526XmFH1h4Tw 

Opened in Sept. 2012, eat. was the first restaurant to be part of the Downtown Revitalization Project in luring businesses to be part of the permanent venture. Its chef & owner, Natalie Young, was tapped for this restaurant; she had 12 years of previous experience at restaurants on the Strip, such as Hard Rock Caf, MGM Grand, & Paris LAS. She named the restaurant "eat." to describe a place where locals can come, eat, & talk/enjoy one another. In its first 34 days of opening, the restaurant served 2,300 customers!

Metered curbside parking available.  No reservations taken. We did not have a problem in finding a parking space, nor did we have to wait to be seated, probably because it was midmorning on a weekday; we heard that there are lines on weekends.

Can't wait for our next trip to Vegas so we can eat at eat.!

I've been torn about my review of Giada for a couple weeks now.  There were some HUGE highs and some MAJOR lows of my experience there.  I will appologize for the length of this review, in advance. If someone from management reads this, I will be glad to discuss further.

I was traveling for work and having dinner by myself.  I stopped into Giada (2 weeks after opening) and asked how long the wait will be and if i could just find a spot at the bar.  The manager at the front of the house said that the bar was being used for overflow, and that the wait would be about 45 minutes to sit.  I agreed and went to play some blackjack at the Cromwell.

After about an hour, nobody called, so i went to check.  Upon arriving, the hostess said that I could be seated.  On my way to the seat (which ended up being at the bar), she offered to give me a tour of the restaurant.  She showed me the house made pasta, the kitchen, the bread, and other areas,  I was very excited to feast.

As I sat at the bar, i ordered a McClellan scotch.  The bartender then gave me an iPad menu.  As I was looking through the menu, i only saw Antipasto dishes.  I asked if I could see the complete menu, and was then told that only antipasto is available at the bar.  This was not explained to me, and I was even led to believe (due to the tour and conversation with the hostess) that the entire menu was available.

After looking at the menu for 15 minutes, I decided I would not eat there because I did not just want antipasto.  I asked for the check, but the bartender, Katie (who was amazing) asked me to please stay and said the would find the manager for me.  She also said that she would bring me out some antipasto dishes while I was waiting.

They brought out some big antipasto dishes, and I will admit that they were quite good.  There exceeded my expectations, and I was happy I stayed.  Finally as I was eating, the manager did come out.  He then went to the couple next to me, and asked them if everything was OK.  They said things were fine.  I knew he was supposed to ask me, but because I look young and was dressed in a T-shirt, I think he decided to ignore me.  The bartender then gesture to him that he was supposed to be talking to ME,  He then asked me if everything was OK.

I explained the situation to him, and told him I really wanted to try the food from the full menu.  I know that he has made this exception for people in the past from talking to the bartender (and that is why she called him), but he decided not to budge for me.  He gave me some BS excuse and I could tell he was just not being very genuine.  It honestly would have been better for the restaurant to just not even had him come see me.  He basically offered nothing and then left.  He said he would get me a free drink, that never game

So, why 3 stars?  The bartender, Katie, is AMAZING,  She made a terrible experience great. If not for her, this would have been a 1 star review.  She is an asset to Giada.  She only charged me for the drinks I had and didn't charge for the food (since I didn't even want to order it).  Obviously, she got a large tip.  If the manager didn't come out, this would be a 4-5 star review.

The manager that came out was terrible.  He treated me with little respect and deserved to make this a 1 star review.  The management is a liability to Giada, and she should rethink who is running the customer facing team.  In addition, they should explain the the full menu is not offered at the bar.

I will go back to Giada, sit at a table, and try the full menu.  For now, this experience left me in the middle.

The other day I was reading my past reviews when i relized that I never reviewed Fez! I couldn't believe it!! So I decided to wait for a VERY special occasion to give my review... and what better occasion is there than my 100th review?! 

And then came the next problem... which Fez experience do I share? Do I talk about the first time I went to Fez? Last summer when I went to my first Yelp Elite event where I first met their Sweet Potato Fries? That are so fresh and crispy and sweet and salty at the same time with their honey mustard type sauce? I remember those trays were vanishing before my eyes! I also can't forget the Fez kirsa with it's barbequed sauced grilled chicken, pears and cilantro melted on a large flatbread with manchego cheese. 

Or do I talk about the time I caught brunch at Fez? I had the ever amazing Fez burger! I feel in love with their savory angus burger layered with pear and cheese on a chibatta bun, best lunch ever - even if the salad that it comes is a little on the bitter side. My cousin had the breakfast pasta. A bowl of sausage, peppers, onions, bacon melded together with scrambled eggs and finished off with parmesan cheese. My sister really enjoyed her Douxelle Burger with it's chibatta bun, angus beef, mushrooms, onions, provolone cheese, mustard and tomatos. 

What about the yelp happy hour at Fez? Where my good buddy Robert M. introduced me to their pomegrantini... make it double pleez! Loves it.... I also tried their habanero poppers... sweet, spicy, creamy and crunchy at the same time! They're off menu ya'll but they are ALWAYS what I look forward to! just don't touch your eyes after popping one! Oh and their hummus!! Garlicky creamed chikpeas with olive oil and served with warm kisra. So delish! 

And then there was the time I went to Fez for Queer Christmas. The queens were abound trading vinyl copies of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's Sings and a photo session with tranny santy with yours truely behind the lens! That was such an awesome night, but it wouldn't have been as amazing if it weren't for the crazy-awesome bartenders who were keeping them coming!

Or what about the time I went for my beloved Thomas' birthday party? We were tossing back Tommitinis all night long! I introduced all of ya'll to my good friend who helped me to break the ice with some strangers and helped me to attack a platter of their Rosemary Chicken Sandwiches... we drunkenly immersed ourselves in its goodness!! Rosemary/lemon marinated grilled chicken topped with pesto, artichokes and bell peppers. It was so good, I took some home!!

That event inspired me to give the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich a try when my mom and I happened to drop by for dinner one day. She really liked her fez lettuce wraps but found them difficult to eat... "It's so long! I can't fit it in my mouth!" she exclaimed... "Ummm... that's usually a good thing mom!" was my smart ass retort. lol... once she figured it out, happily declared them better than P.F. Chang's! haha!! Aren't moms cute?! I liked the Casablanca Sandwich, I found that the grilled chicken, goat cheese, pears, cherries and other various greens on a chibatta buns go VERY well with Fez's S&P fries. A combo, I think shouldn't ever be separated! 

Yup... I'm not sure which experience I'll write about in my yelp review! All I know is that everytime I leave Fez I'm stuffed and eliated that I went, and that ain't the booze talking! One of the best things about Fez is that even though it's uber-slick and crazy-mod in decor... it still feels like home! I go and I know I'll see a friend... or atleast someone I drunkenly hit on inbetween drink orders! My ONLY complaint is that sometimes the servers need to be reminded of what you just asked for. I once ran out of the sauce for the sweet potato fries and needed to ask for some three times before I got it. 

Another thing I'll need to think of when I do write my Fez review... is what is my message going to be to my yelpers? I think I'll say something like... Hurry up and GO! What has been keeping you?! Sure it's uber-sleekness may seem cold at first, but once you sit down and get comfortable, it becomes home. Give the sweet potato fries a go and try the Fez burger - you won't regret eaither! The people there are very cool and of course there's THOMAS!! The host with the most! Always with something crazy to say. He keeps the party rockin'! If there's ONE thing you need to know about Fez it's that you are about to have a good meal. 

Yup... I think I'll write something along those lines! I unno... whatcha'll think?

The Palazzo and the Venetian are exactly what you expect a Las Vegas Hotel Room to be.  If you look around the room and think to yourself, I could live here and be happy, then you know you are staying in the right place.  All the "basic" rooms are suites with a step down into a living room with sectional couch, desk, and table.  If you want to hang out in a nice room with friends and have a few drinks, then this is your room.  3 flat screen TVs (Living room, Bedroom, and yes in the bathroom).  The marble bathroom has a nice soaking tub and glass shower.  Private room for the toilet as well and dual sinks.  The beds are very high quality with high thread count linen.  Only the Wynn has better beds IMO.  The window drapes are nice and thick if you want to sleep in.  They are also push button automated.  It's a feeling of power to push a button only to reveal the Las Vegas Strip and it's night life below you.  It's the best basic room you will find in Vegas bar none.  5 stars.

For me the pool while nice, isn't on the right side of the hotel.  If you enjoy morning sun, you won't get it here.  Of course this depends on the time of year, but with us staying here in April, only 1/4th of the pool had any sun by 11 am.  Most of the time when we would leave the pool around Noon or 1 for lunch, the pool area was still shaded by the hotel.  Pool side drinks were also a shadow of the quality you get at the Wynn and at the same price tag.  The frozen drinks aren't made to order.   3.5 stars for the pool.

One disadvantage to staying at a high end hotel are the black jack tables.  They aren't cheaper than $15 min.  If your gaming strategy involves putting more money on the table while you are winning, well it's not hard to often have a $45 hand and have to double down.  Now you got $90 on one hand of blackjack.  It can go south real quick if you don't show restraint.  The guy sitting next to me, was playing 3 hands at a time and must have lost about $5,000 in a matter of minutes.  So If you like stumbling downstairs from your room right into a reasonable priced casino, perhaps the Monte Carlo is more your speed than the Palazzo, Venetian, or Wynn.  That said, all the dealers were friendly.  If you are going to lose money, a nice smile and conversation from the guy pulling 6 card 21s to ruin your double down does go a long way. 4 stars for the casino

At first the parking seemed to be crazy here.  It's the only strip resort with an underground garage and not very well designed, with cars getting frustrated trying to get out, it's easy to get mowed down.  But as our stay went on, I realized if you always parked on the bottom floors, you could get a spot right next to the elevators and miss out on all the craziness, so it's one of the shortest walks you'll have from your car to the casino.  Parking 3 stars.

When reading a review about a hotel in Vegas, it's good to know the reviewer's experience with all the strip offers.  Other hotels, I've stayed at are The Wynn, Venetian, MGM Grand, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and Las Vegas Hilton.  You aren't going to find the perfect hotel.  Even though I gave the Palazzo 5 stars, they do have flaws.  But feeling you aren't getting luxury for what you pay for, isn't one of them. Just walking around the highly polished luxury hotel will make you feel like a million bucks.

My bf & I have always been fans of Gordon Ramsay. After watching the whole season of Master Chef Jr. I was mindblown at how those little kids could replicate Ramsay's infamous beef wellington. Everytime I see pics of his wellington, I start salivating, hoping to try it one day. Well...THE DAY FINALLY CAME!! I know he has the London West Hollywood restaurant in L.A., which served the wellington, but the reviews weren't great. I'm so glad I waited to try his food in Vegas, rather than the L.A. restaurant!

We had reservations at 9:30pm, but arrived to vegas a little late Fri night due to traffic. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us at 10:15PM.
NOTE: HELL'S KITCHEN TASTING MENU STOPS AT 930PM

We were guided through the "tunnel" and given the option to our table upstairs via elevator or stairs. The view upstairs is amazing with this giant neon structure of Gordon's hands making the wellington. The interior is chic decorated in colors of black and red w/ a big British flag painted on the ceiling. Downstairs is an open kitchen, bar, and framed photos of Ramsay. It's very classy yet romantic at the same time

Our server Yaron was such a sweetheart! We came for our anniversary & he made it very memorable. I felt like royalty dining in this restaurant!  After browsing the menu, Yaron pulled up the meat cart and the carnivore in me wanted to devour every meat on that cart! He said that if I finished the 24oz bone in rib eye, he'd applaud and give me a free t-shirt. I will most definitely be back to take on this challenge :D

Shortly after ordering, the fresh breads came out on a plate (different than most places serving it in a basket). We ended up eating 2 plates of the bread 'cause it was so bomb! I wanted to get some to-go at the end of the night, but forgot to ask. ALL 4 VARIETY OF BREADS WERE SOO GOOD. My fav were the brioches w/ truffle and pancetta (bacon). The walnut baguette was good as well especially w/ the butter. I LOVE the butter here w/ the sea salt. Gives texture & taste. 

English Chowder - smoked haddock, scallops, fingerling medallions, 
citrus pearls. Wow at first I thought it'd be like clam chowder, but this takes chowder to a different level. Initially it came out in the soup bowl w/ just the scallop, haddock, etc. & then the server pours out the soup from a little pot. Very nice, thick consistency yet not over laden w/ butter. Scallop was cooked to perfection! It was a very filling soup, not your typical chowder.

Maine Lobster - O..M..G.. the lobster was a work of art. The lobster cream was delicious, I wanted to lick the whole plate. Lobster was cooked to succulent and had a beautiful red color. Very tender, buttery smooth, fresh. The lentils were cooked perfectly as well, but I do wish that they accompanied this dish w/ something else other than lentil.

Beef Wellington for 2 - Over $100 for this bad boy. It's funny the say for 2, when really it's just one wellington, but cut in half. So usually if you order wellington for 1, you get just half the wellington..It literally took 45 mins to get this dish. The wait was agonizing 'cause my mind just kept thinking about how good it'd be. When the plate finally came my heart was racing. This dish looked exactly like it did on T.V.! Everything was beyond amazing. Pastry crust was flaky, filet inside was roasted to medium rare. All the flavors in one bite blended so well I was so amazed. The potato puree and red wine demi glaze were excellent. The glazed vegetables (parsnips & carrots) accompanying the dish had glaze that were shimmering.

Demi Roasted Bone Marrow - HUGE bones plated beautifully, decorated w/ green salsa verde. These totally blew away Mastro's bone marrow. I didn't care if my arteries would be clogged, these babies tasted so rich as we scooped the marrow out from the big bones.

Sticky Toffee Pudding - I noticed every table ordered this and so we had to try it since everyone raved about it & it's their signature dessert. I'm not sure why they call it pudding, when it it really is a date cake. I LOVE the brown butter ice cream, it's cute how they even made it look like a stick of butter. Yaron drizzled the toffee syrup onto the cake and as it flowed spreading throughout the plate I couldn't wait to dig in. The date cake was moist and when you eat the ice cream w/ the cake & toffee, it's an explosion of sweetness in your mouth.

We didn't finish til after midnight and were the last ones to leave the restaurant (they close at midnight). Midway through our meal, we felt bad staying so late so we told Yaron that he could bring out the dessert when the Wellingtons came out, but he insisted no rush and that we should take our time to enjoy our meal. That is customer service at its finest. We never felt rushed at all, truly an amazing experience at this restaurant. Can't wait to come back! O BTW, I wanted to get a pic w/ Christina, but was notified she has left and is now exec chef at BurGR!

Yay!  A great donut shop just up the street from me!  

Uh oh, this may be bad for my waistline!

Coco Donuts is a cute little donut shop just off of W. Cheyenne.  I happened to notice it on my way to the grocery store and I just had to investigate the place.  I am so happy I did because Coco Donuts is a great donut shop!  Let me tell you why:

1. The customer service is AMAZING!  I walked in and was greeted with a gigantic smile and a very happy and genuine, "How are you?"  This is the way to get my attention and my business for sure.  The lady working the counter was so cheerful and a pleasure to deal with.  There were so many sweet options, I was a little overwhelmed.  She was offering advice and totally selling me on some of her fantastic donuts.  I love this store just for her now!  It seems so rare to get awesome customer service these days that when I do get it, I am shocked/pleased/mind-blown all rolled up into one.  Yay for happy people and good customer service!  Coco's definitely gets a bonus star for customer service!

2. The store's selection!  This shop is all about the classic donuts you have always known and loved.  Yes, every now and then I want a crazy donut with ridiculous toppings, but usually I just want a really good glazed donut or a chocolate covered twist.  Yummm.  This shop is filled with the oldies but goodies like glazed, maple, coconut, cinnamon crumb, blueberry, sugar, and of course chocolate covered.  This is just the tip of the iceberg of their selection.  They had at least 20 varieties when I was there and that was at the end of the day!  I can't wait to check it out earlier in the day to see even more varieties.  And for your croissant lovers, they have them too!

3.  The the donuts!  First off, they are huge!  The circle donuts were easily the size of a CD and at least 1.5 in thick.  The bar style are at least 6in long and the same height.  Seriously big donuts.  The donuts are light and airy, but with substance behind it.  They hold up to the toppings, but then almost melt in your mouth when you bite into them.  I had a maple bar and it was delish.  I stole a bite of my hubby's chocolate covered twist and it was delightful.  I also snuck a bite of my daughter's sprinkle donut and it was like a party in my mouth. (You would think I would be 700lbs always stealing bites of their food, but that is a topic for another day!)  These are really great tasting donuts.  Woohoo for tasty treats!

4. The prices!  1 donut starts at $.95, 1/2 dozen starts at $5.50 and a dozen starts at $9.50.  As for the crossaints, they were $1.50-$2.95.  Pretty decent prices for really good quality donuts and croissants.  They also have coffees, teas, hot chocolate, and other drinks starting at $1.50, so you can get a fun, sugary snack for super cheap!

5. They have cronuts! I Cronuts are all the rage right now and usually hard to find, but not at Coco Donuts!  They have several varieties from plain, chocolate covered, cream filled, just to name a few.  I had a glazed one and found it quite tasty.  I am not a cronut-a-holic like many people, but I do think that Coco has had the best that I have tried to date.  

So the donuts are yummy, the staff is friendly, and the prices are reasonable.  This shop is a home run in my book!

Welcome to Old Town! What took you so long!? I've been anxiously watching the "coming soon" sign and waiting for Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers to open. Finally they did and last night we got to give it a try! This location has the sport's bar perfected. The "concept" is simple: Extensive beer list, cool drink concoctions, juicy burgers, accompanying snacks and TVs and seating everywhere you look. Throw in a spacious patio and you've got a perfect storm (in a good way). 

We stopped by around 8:30 pm on Friday night and saw that it was pretty packed so we thought we'd have to wait. However, thanks to the amount of seating they have, we didn't have to wait even a second! They seated us right away and my husband was in heaven thanks to the sports playing on the TVs everywhere we looked. 

The menu has plenty to choose from. Of course the burger is the way to go here, but they also had chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. The burger menu is long and if that's not enough, they also have a BYOB (build your own burger) option. Not feeling a burger? Give the BYOM (build your own mac n cheese) a try! First, we ordered the buffalo chicken dip. Wow. Absolutely delicious. I want to recreate this at home. It had the perfect kick to it. It came with chips, celery and carrots to dip. For the main course, I went for one of the "favorites" and got the Bacon Bleu Burger with french fries. Another wow! This burger is juicy goodness at its best. The burger is topped with bleu cheese, bacon, special mayo and caramelized onions. It is incredibly hearty and I could barely finish half. It would be easy to share. The french fries had a nice salty-peppery flavor to them. The food here is hearty and perfect if you're looking for a good All American meal. I've been wanting one of these restaurants to open in Old Town for awhile!

Before I stop, I need to talk about the drinks. They have some creative drink choices, include beer flights and a "beer and a shot" choice. For $9 you get a beer and accompanying shot pre-selected by the restaurant to compliment each other. It was a fun little activity before the meal! There are several beers on top and they also had a detailed cocktail list. 

I'll be seeing you again soon!

Why did we discover this so late?! Well, technically, my friend and I wanted to come last month but something came up and ruined our schedule so we finally got to try it this month! I must say, I likey lots!

First and foremost, this food fair isn't fancy so don't come here expecting a ton of things. They also don't have a huge variety of foods for you to choose from. It's a smaller function run by volunteers. Kind of reminds me of something like a family gathering. 

Come early! My friend and I arrived at around 9:30 am and all the tables were already taken. Not to mention, there were already a lot of people there so we parked pretty far from the entrance since the parking lot was full. 

There are several ways to go about beginning your trip. You can exchange your cash for tokens -- any amount. Don't worry. If you don't use up your tokens then you can exchange it back for cash. If you don't want to, I think that's fine as well because I noticed that a lot of them take cash regardless. Though the token idea makes it easier than getting cash out and stuff. 

My friend and I shared most of the dishes so we got to try a majority of them on our first visit.

Stew pork noodles. $5 ...You got to choose either the rice vermicelli noodles or the flat wide rice noodles. We went with the vermicelli and we liked it. Granted, we didn't know exactly what kind of meat it came with. We figured out that the meatballs were pork balls but as for the rest of the meat, I thought it had chicken too. BUTTTT it's pork. We had fun guessing though. 

Chicken and rice. $5... Awesome dish. I really really enjoyed this and even bought a 2nd serving to eat as lunch for the next day. It reminded me of Hainan Chicken ... best part? You got to choose your meat. You get the option of white, dark, or a combo of both. The rice was lightly flavored with chicken broth and eating the chicken and rice together was great. There was also a ginger sauce you could use but tbh, I don't even need it :)

BBQ Pork & Chicken Satay. $1 per skewer. The wait for this is amazingly long so when you get here early, be sure to put in your order ASAP. People order 20-30 at a time to take home. My friend and I waited half an hour for our order. They even had 3 grills going but were still backed up!! This also took me by surprise because when I think Satay, I think savory...when I took a bite of one of my skewers, it was SWEET. It was SUGARY SWEET. Holy moly  ... I'm not sure how I felt about it. I liked it but I kinda wanna just wipe the sugar off of it. 

Sweet roti. $1 ... This was really yummy. They give it to you right when it's hot. It was buttery sweet goodness. I really liked it and I'm glad I had this in the morning. My body will have time to take care of all that butter! Definitely try this. 

Steamed Tapioca Dumpling. $2 .. Interesting. It was a sweet and savory type of snack in the form of balls with pork filling. They give you lettuce, cilantro, and pepper with it. I'm not too much of a fan. I guess I don't particularly do well with a sweet/savory mix. I get confused. 

Sweet sticky rice with taro. $1 each. This was yummy. They also had a banana version but I didn't get one .. so maybe next time. Really enjoyed it though :D I had saved this for later so by the time I ate it, it was cold :( .. I think it'd be better when it was warm. 

We also tried one of their coconut jelly dessert things and their thai tea. Both were good. But everything was just really sweet to me so bring lots of water with you haha! My friend and I will DEFINITELY be back and we're going to try to bring other friends to try this as well! We had lots of fun here :)

This is my review of mine and my husband's experience for my birthday on May 1st, 2013. I am upset to give The Cosmo a two star review, but based on my experience with the check-in process and having a suite here I cannot give anymore. I have been a fan of Cosmo since it opened. I've spent a lot of money here. I'm a local and I sing its praises to out of towners all the time. But I will NOT be recommending for any of my friends (local or otherwise) to actually stay here.

We arrived early (just about an hour) prior to check-in time and we were greeted by a very nice, chipper young lady who set about getting our information. First off, we had just made the reservation the day before, so we were absolutely sure it was there. The girl typed in our name repeatedly to no avail. My husband whipped out his phone and showed her our email confirmation so she could look it up by the confirmation number instead. TA-DA. There it was with our last name misspelled. Hurray. At least we were smart enough to bring our confirmation with us or else they probably never would have found our reservation to begin with. 

They have our reservation for the Terrace Suite for one night. She asks us if we're there for business or pleasure and I say it's my birthday and we're locals and we just wanted to get a room for the night and play by the pool. She seems okay with that and continues tapping away, then she excuses herself and brings forth some other guy in a suit. O HAI guy in a suit, what do you want? He introduces himself and shakes mine and my husband's hand. He then proceeds to chastise us and shame-shame us for being locals and getting a hotel room for a night.

"It's our policy to inform locals that our rooms are not meant for loud, raging parties. We expect you to be courteous to the other guests. After all, there are plenty of other places to have a good time here in the resort."

OH. OKAY GUY IN SUIT. I'll try not to have a raging balls-to-the-wall party in my room since you've wagged your finger in my face before I even check in.

What gets me is that he specifically said it's policy for them to inform LOCALS. Because, well, guess what locals? Cosmo doesn't want your business if you're just there for a night for your birthday with your husband trying to enjoy a suite and have dinner with your friends. Seriously. I was so incensed by this guy I didn't know what to do besides awkwardly laugh at his remarks.

He then goes on to ask if we're "in the industry". 

No. I reply. I work for the federal government and my husband is Air Force. 

"OOOOH" says guy in suit, "Thank you for your service."

YAH. Fuck you. You were just giving us a lesson in how we should conduct ourselves in our room that we're paying good money for, GUY IN SUIT. How about you fuck off with your "thank you for your service".

I've never been treated that way when I've checked into any hotel before on the strip. I've never been shamed because I'm a local. I've never been given a talking to by some random guy just because I happen to be local and I happen to just be getting a suite for the night. I think it was ridiculous. I think it was rude. And I think The Cosmo does a whole lot of assuming about their guests.

Well I guess my young appearance my tattoos must have just sent alarm bells ringing up the asses of these people.

So our check-in process basically sucked and I am sad to report how far it dropped The Cosmo in my eyes.

Our room - Terrace Suite, 28th floor, facing the Bellagio Fountains. Amazing room, full kitchen, living area, wrap around suite, plush bed, interesting artwork. Lighting that goes completely on and off when you leave the suite. A tub that could have been much bigger in my opinion and a decent enough bathroom. We didn't call for room service, so can't comment. 

We DID have my 4 friends come up to the suite AFTER we had dinner. We all fuckin jumped all over the beds and turned over tables and lit a fire in the trash can and brought in a fuckin tiger from Sig & Roy's Magical Garden and we fucked that place up. OH JUST KIDDING. We watched the fountain show, hung out, had champagne, talked, and had my birthday cake while I opened presents. Afterward my LOCAL CRAZY MUTHER EFFING FRIENDS left and my husband and I watched TV and went to bed. OH MAH GAWD.

Anyway, that's my experience at The Cosmo. Not so good, eh? Dearest locals - go elsewhere, lest you be chastised before you even get a chance to enjoy.

Laissez les bons temps rouler!  

To the non-native New Orleans peeps, "Let the good times roll!"  That is exactly what Streetcar Po'boys is doing with their new restaurant here in Vegas.  I actually grew up in New Orleans, the West Bank if you are interested, so I consider myself an expert in NOLA food.  I remember eating po'boys at least once a week when we lived there because they are just what everyone eats.  Why, because NOLA po'boys are AWESOME!  So when I heard about Streetcar Po'boys I had to get down there and check it out ASAP.  I found some great things happening as well.  

Here's whats up:

This little hole in the wall joint is totally legit when it comes to New Orleans style po'boys.  They have all of the NOLA po'boy norms like shrimp, catfish, oyster, muffaletta, and boudin options on the menu for those who want an authentic NOLA meal.  They also have non-NOLA options like grilled cheese, BBQ pork, chicken parm, and tuna salad, just to name a few.  This is great because no matter who you are with, the will definitely find something they will like to try.  

The ingredients are super fresh and many are flown in from Louisiana.  The french bread is from Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans, which is THE bread that made po'boys famous.  It is delicious french bread that has a fantastically flaky crust and fluffy soft insides.  The boudin sausage is from Lafayette, LA, which is right in the middle of Cajun Country and where the best boudin is made.  The shrimp they use are the wonderfully gorgeous Gulf shrimp.  Yum!

The sandwiches all come "dressed" unless otherwise stated.  This is straight out of NOLA and how you order sandwiches everywhere you go.  Dressed means to have lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo on your sandwich.  Very nice touch to thrown in that saying.

They also have tasty sides to go with your sandwich.  Each po'boy comes with Cajun Chips, which are house made potato chips with a yummy Cajun seasoning coating them.  They are really quite good, if I say so myself.  You also get to pick an additional side like french fries, hush puppies, mac n' cheese, beer battered onion rings, to name a few.

Oh, the desserts!  Again, Streetcar is doing it right with their dessert menu.  They have all of the NOLA favorites I loved growing up as a kid like bananas foster, bread pudding, cheesecake, and KING CAKE.  I think this is the only place in Vegas I have ever seen King cake on the menu.  And drumroll please......They make Beignets in house!  Fresh Beignets any time of day is a dream come true right there!  Drool.....

This is a family run place as well.  Gwen, the owner, is almost always there.  She is a true delight!  She came up to us before we were even seated.  As soon as she opened her mouth, we all knew that accent!  She's from NOLA and proud of it!  She is a lovely Southern belle that knows her po'boys!  She was so friendly and went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  We talked to her on and off the entire meal and just had a blast.  She deserves a star all unto herself!

The only "Eh" issue I had was the sweet tea cups.  They use really small cups for their tea.  2 sips and your cup was empty.  Bigger tea cups would be great improvement.  Other than that, this place ROCKS MY SOCKS OFF!

I was so happy after my first visit.  I can't wait to go back and try a dozen more po'boys! 

Really, if you like po'boys or just want to try something new, get down to Streetcar Po'boys because your belly will love you for it!

I am still alive. I am still grateful. I still remember. 

This week, I celebrate the outcome of a lifesaving surgery. This time each year, I take a road trip to remember how lucky I am to be alive and the life lessons that I learned from almost dying. 

El Cortez. A great find. A bargain-priced well-run, cleaner-than-most hotel in old-school downtown dirty Vegas. This location is perfect for a variety of traveler's wants, especially mine.

Steps from the double-decker 'Deuce' bus which runs the strip 24 hours a day starting here. If you have no means of transportation or just love saving lives by letting sober hands take the wheel, having the Deuce, ($7 per 24 hours) steps away is critical.

I didn't love Vegas my first visit. I flew in from LA, stayed at Cesar's Palace, took taxis to and from exclusive nightclubs and fancy steak houses with my former-frat-boy ex. 

Since, I've stayed at a gamut of convenient-to-the-strip hotels, found a nonexclusive place to dance and liked it. But I didn't love Vegas until I found the old-timey Vegas that resides at the Fremont street experience, steps from El Cortez. 

Why I prefer 'downtown' to 'uptown' in general represents one of the reasons my nickname at Yelp is "grassroots girl". The other, is that this account, like all my social networking, began to respond with an authentic voice to corporate injustice. My commitment to the ideology behind both is also what I celebrate this week, why I came & why I loved it here.

I lost my memory once years ago. Can you imagine waking up ten years from now with no memory of the time passing within those ten years? That was me, years ago. 

I was a broke teenager with lavender hair who carried picket signs and fronted a rock band, 13. When I woke up, I was VERY different, twenty something. It wasn't just the blond hair or the fancy car in my driveway that was different, I didn't know my mail carrier's name nor did I care. *The good news about finding out the bad news about yourself, is that you can change.

I'll be prone to falling in love with "uptown" things forever. I will fall off the course once set for myself, ideals included. Ridiculous insecurities will drive my wants to "fit in" and "be accepted". I'll have the opportunity to be both ashamed or proud of where I came from.

With any luck, I'll hang on to 'grassroots' ideals. Won't be easy. Once a year, I will take a road trip to remember how I'd once forgotten everything I stood for on the path to acceptance from everybody but me.

If you want access to the most exclusive nightclubs, if you like the limelight, if you steer from classic towards the newest, coolest, chicest, you might not like it here. If you send your food back because it never meets your standards, if you only frequent the "in" spots only when the "in" crowd is there, this might not be for you. 

If you have not yet deleted all memory of the years spent turning your once-idealistic values to shit, you might choose to stay elsewhere. There was a time in my life when this place wasn't up to my standards.

 I was an asshole. A bitch. A stuck up jerk who only cared about the label beneath her lapel and the logo on her car keys. I'm not saying that I'm not all of the aforementioned still. (I am) It will be a lifetime uphill battle to avoid becoming that way again completely. Loving my stay here is proof that I have not fallen all the way off the tracks.

We had two double beds on the 5th floor. Room 5509 had a GREAT view from the window. We used the coffee maker to make hot water for tea. (the coffee is meh) We watched the big flat-screen TV for the weather report. Over 100 degrees!

A fridge was given to us on request, on the house. We filled it with fruit, drinks and milk for cereal which we purchased from the bodega spotted from our beautiful window view. 

We took advantage of the Shea butter lotions, soaps and high-end toiletries provided. We used the lush bath towels and called down for more. We took some extra towels to the dingy pool 2 blocks away, but we had the pool all to ourselves so had a great time swimming anyway.

I drank espresso every morning from the coolest cafe/record store/art gallery in the world located just steps away. We watched the 'Tribute To Queen' show at the Fremont experience where water was 2 for $1. deep fried Oreo cookies, 99 cents each & green cans of cream ale, 2 bucks. 

We shared steak dinners ($6.99) in the middle of the night when the "gambler's specials" roll out. We treated ourselves to a  $6.25 breakfast buffet (coffee & OJ included) from Vegas Club down the block. We waited behind the wise elderly locals outfitted with walkers and wheel chairs who smiled at us. We smiled back. 

We slept all day in the cool comfort of personalized AC without hearing neighbors or slot machines. We felt safe leaving the casino late-night. Highly recommended. Will return. Hopefully, grassroots forever.;-)

While the boys make it a golf day, the ladies spa away...at least that was the plan. This was my first time visiting Fort McDowell and I must say that for being a Radisson, the grounds were nicer then I would have expected. The pool is spacious, the water is ice cold (which is perfect on a hot day), the cocktails are very reasonably priced (around $6.50) and the staff is friendly. However, sadly, the spa was anything but a "day spa." 

Spa days are my weakness. For me, taking a spa day is the perfect escape from reality and a way for me to go on vacation without the costs of flights and accommodations. I enjoy spa days because I can arrive early and enjoy the amenities. I like to check in with the aroma of spa scents welcoming me and spa music calming the atmosphere. I like to enjoy the woman's locker room with amenities like a personal locker, jacuzzi, showers, sweet smelling products, etc. I also like to sit in a calming waiting room and clear my mind before my service. Did I experience any of this at the Radisson's "day spa?" Sadly, I didn't experience one aspect of this. Instead, this is what I experienced...

I entered the Radisson and followed the signs to the "spa." I entered the room that claimed to be the spa and instead found myself in a meeting room converted into a small gym (similar to those found in corporate motels). I looked around for the spa entrance and didn't see anything. Finally, I saw a small sign on a cabinet that said to check in to the spa at the gift shop. I walked down the hallway to a gift shop where the lady working the counter checked me into the spa. I asked about a ladies' locker room but learned that one didn't exist and instead, I was given a key for a "locker" that was against the wall of the mini gym. I came to the spa planning on working out, getting my massage, using the amenities and ending the day at the pool. Instead, I sat on a chair in the mini gym while waiting for my service. As it turns out, the spa is actually three rooms off of the mini gym. The spa doesn't have a ladies' locker room, a proper waiting area or any feeling of a spa at all. The workout didn't happen because the gym only had two treadmills and both were being used. Instead of changing in a ladies' locker room, I had to take my bag into the solo bathroom in the gym to change into my suit. My friend and I both booked massages for the day but they had to be an hour apart. Now I know why. It's because they only have one massage therapist. I didn't see any other treatments going on during my visit either. 

Now, my experience is no fault of the massage therapist's. She was professional, nice and provided a nice massage. The massage therapist mentioned that I was not very relaxed during my massage and I wanted to comment back that it's very hard to relax when you're getting a massage in a random room off the hotel gym with the hotel hallway on the other side of the wall. The icing on the cake was when a group of people (maybe on a tour?) walked in on my massage. Yes, they walked into my massage room right smack in the middle of my massage. It was one of the most awkward moments of my life. Again, the massage therapist was wonderful and I feel bad that she has to be associated with this disappointing spa experience. 

Don't be fooled by the long menu listing a variety of treatments. All will be done in a maximum of three small rooms off the gym. There is no sense of spa here and if I could have canceled my massage upon arrival, I would have. This shouldn't be considered a "day spa." If they are going to promote anything, they should say that offer "spa services" within the hotel, but there was nothing that fell within the "day spa" category during my experience. It doesn't take a lot to please me, but when I'm spending a decent amount of money on a spa day, I expect a spa day. 

If you visit this hotel, stay the night and enjoy the pool and renowned golf course, but think twice before booking a spa day here.

WARNING: this is going to be a very long review....but it's also gonna be hella useful (and you might as well throw in a "cool" and "funny" too....okay, maybe not funny.)

Ever since some of my cousins moved to Vegas, we very rarely go to the strip.  I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I stepped foot on the strip.  Do I care?  Heck no!  I hate crowds, I don't party, and I'm not a big gambler.  Those are all the reasons why you'd go to the strip anyway.  

What I love about having family in Vegas is they can tell you all the local hot spots.  The Red Rock is definitely one of them.  We came here last year when it first opened and it was wonderful.  I love the round set up of the casino floor/bars/club.  This past weekend, we booked a few rooms here to have an early Christmas at my cousin's house.  I wish I was here for more than one night.  Are you ready?  Here's what they have:
- "Cherry" nightclub (multi-level), 7 bars, 1 lounge
- Food Court including: Fatburger, 2 Starbucks, Rubios, Panda Express, Ben & Jerry
- Restaurants including something Japanese, Mexican, Italian, Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=E4UUqPlwClhSZ_JaRHvXPQ&q=grand+cafe), T-Bone Chophouse (which my cousin said was excellent), Feast Buffet, and............an Oyster Bar.  The Oyster Bar is beautiful and unique.
- Spa with prices higher than Burke Williams
- "Adventure Spa" services including: horseback riding, ranger tours, guided hikes, rock climbing, bike tours and river rafting
- Regal Cinemas...........yes, a movie theatre
- 24 hour bowling alley.............are you kidding me?  Freakin' awesome!
- Arcade for the kids

The rooms.........ultra modern.  I love the chocolate brown/green combination.  (Other rooms had white/brown combinations).  It also had:
- $12.99 internet/day
- Huge flat screen in the room...mini flat screen at the end of the tub
- Comfy couches, chairs, beds, benches at the end of each bed
- Bose alarm clock which was already playing for us as we entered
- Door Bell!  A freakin'doorbell!
- I sat in the tub.  It went as high as my shoulders and I had room at the end of my feet.
- The only thing I could say is it could use a larger shower.  
- Careful if you end up getting drunk in your room.  There is a fully censored mini-bar.  If you remove an item for more than 45 seconds, it will charge your credit card.  You'll end up taking home an intimacy kit for your fiance, like my cousin did.  

The hotel is just beautiful.  I love the giant red doors (at the main lobby) that you could see in to.  The hallways leading to the rooms are decorated and lit with a bit of a dizzying effect but are beautiful.  The doors to the rooms are in their own little hallway which is awesome so you can't hear the crazy drunkards plowing down the hallway.  There's free bottled water and apples at the check in counter.  They have heat lamps outside as you're waiting for the valet.  The valets.......super nice (some females too), as are the bell guys.  

A standard room (two queen beds) is plenty of room for 4 people (except maybe the closet).  For $160 on the Saturday before Christmas, I'd say that's a great deal.  Yes.....it is 20 minutes away from the strip, but I don't need the strip (or the crowds), and you shouldn't either when there are plenty of other great spots, like the Red Rock Casino~Resort~Spa.

***GREAT PLACE FOR FRESH, LOCAL FOOD***

La Grande Orange Grocery is not your typical grocery store. Consider it to be a casual cafe-cafeteria-ish where you can order fresh baked, homemade goodies and comfort meals from breakfast, lunch and dinner. They use ingredients that are pure and natural - nothing here is made with preservatives or additives! They also have items for those who are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free. 

La Grande Orange (LGO) reminds me of Elephant's Delicatessen in Portland, OR. And if you know me, I love Elephant's Deli! So as you can imagine, I fell in love with the atmosphere at LGO. I came to visit one morning for brunch with the parentals and also met up with an old elementary school friend who lives in town. You pretty much order your food at the cash register, pay and wait by the pick-up window for your plate/orders, afterwards, you just find a seat anywhere. 

The atmostphere of LGO is hustlin' and bustlin', they are quick to serve and food is made within minutes! As you can imagine, the place is quite loud, so stay tuned for your name being called as they serve your dish at the pick-up window. 

FYI: They have a second location at the PHX Sky Harbor Airport (Terminal 4-D). I'm kinda glad that they have a location in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, so I can grab a few goodies to go on the plane and devour!

[devour]
*LGO FAMOUS ENGLISH MUFFINS ($1.95/each; $9-half dozen; $16.50-dozen)
Ohhh emmm gee! Their English muffins are large! Lightly toasted and sliced in half, the English muffin was served with a side of their homemade preserves and butter. You can tell this stuff is homemade by the texture as you chew into each carbalicious bite. I found out that they sell a bag of them at the airport, so I was able to grab a half dozen to share back home with my foodie friends! *highly recommended*
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#bJEjXkOfQmAZdkt106R1QA

*FAMOUS FRENCH PANCAKES ($6.75; **4 STARS**)
The French pancakes were very light and fluffy! It sorta reminded me of a crepe texture. The pancake was made with honey and creme fraiche. It was topped off with several slices of fresh strawberries, which made the meal quite delightful and refreshing! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#3RCEJaMiE1A7SYjfmw-Gsw

*BIRCHERMUESLI ($5.25; **4 STARS**)
Consider this breakfast dish something you can also grab on the go! (Also served at the PHX Airport!) Here you have chilled Swiss oats, mixed with raisins, slivered almonds and organic vanilla yogurt, all combine to make a healthy and fulfilling breakfast! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to grab on the go and wants something that is healthy!

[dessert]
*RED VELVET CUPCAKE (**3 STARS**)
Was kinda dense. The cream cheese frosting was very thick and delightfully complimented the cupcake. I wish the cupcake had a bit more fluffiness in the cake's texture. But nonetheless, it was a decent sugar fix - but nothing to go wild and crazy about. 

*SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE (**3 STARS**)
This cookie was recommended by the employees. I didn't think the cookie would be uber salty! I like salty-sweet mixtures, but there was too much salt in the cookie for me to eat. The chunks of snow-frost-like sea-salt, had to be dusted off so that the cookie was bearable to consume. I think this cookie would've been awesome if they decreased the sodium content. I did prefer this though over the red velvet cupcake. 

[imbibe]
*FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE 
Why not get orange juice from a place that has "orange" within their name and logo! The orange juice was very refreshing and full of pulp! I wish I had ordered a larger cup of this instead of a small! They also sell this item at PHX airport so you can grab a cup of it to go! *highly recommended*

FYI: parking can be quite limited in the front, there are spots in the back and sometimes they offer valet (no charge).

If I lived in the area, I would probably be a frequent flyer! Seriously!!! If I'm in the area again, I would try out their burgers and pizzas since that's also a popular item on their menu. If you're visiting Phoenix, definitely make a visit to LGO (or at it's airport location!) Happy travels!

Some decent 'Que on my side of town!

I'll admit, I had to check out this place after it was featured on "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" on the Food Network.  But without this tidbit, I might have never knew the place existed!

Funniest thing about John Mull's is that it is basically located in the middle of residential homes.  Yes!  When you GPS the address you might think you're being led to the wrong place.  But keep truckin' because the BBQ joint is on property of what looks to be a ranch house.  John Mull's eating area shares the common space with what is essentially a butcher block.  Get a whole cow, some eggs, and then a meal of BBQ afterwards?  I don't see why not.

While the market has been around for some time, my review basically goes over the BBQ station.  It used to be just a shack when they first started, lately I hear they have a small food truck type deal to serve folks as well.  They need the help, John Mull's can get busy for lunch!  Typically it's take-out, but they do have a small seating area with about a dozen bench tables or so.  If it's full, eat it out of your truck tailgate like most folks do!

I am not an expert on BBQ by any means, but good food I can do.  Sure, you have your naysayers that go on and on and on about how their BBQ sauce is from a bottle (I can confirm I think it is), but really I don't care.  The meat itself is not artificially processed.  Trimmed in-house, and smoked in-house!  Flavor of the BBQ is what is necessary!  John Mull's makes some mighty decent 'Que.  Easiest thing on the menu to try if you're a noob to this place is just to go with a combo meal.  A 2 Meat Combo will run you about $14, and a 3 Meat Combo will run about $16.  When it's the wifey and I we usually opt for the 3 Meat Combo and share.  Be careful, it's a lot of food!  The 3 Meat Combo will easily feed a third person.  

Combos come with your choice of meats and sides.  Meats include:

-Hot Link
-Brisket
-Ribs
-Pulled Pork
-Pulled Chicken
-1/4 Chicken

Their strength lies in their ribs and brisket I think.  I like their pulled pork, but if I'm having their ribs (which I always do) I compliment it with the brisket.  The ribs are cooked just right, requisite pink ring around the outside, meat pulls off the bone (but not too easily), super moist and tender, finished on the grill with a slathering of BBQ sauce right before serving.  The brisket is flavorful, and just plain juicy, thanks to the lovely fat cap that surrounds each one before smoking.  OK, if you just say 'brisket' when you order your meat, you will most likely just get the lean end of the brisket.  Which is not dry, but not as near darn tasty as the fatty end.  So be specific on which part of brisket you want, lean or fat.  I will usually ask for a 1/2 portion of both.  

For sides, Road Kill Grill has some options too:

-Potato or Macaroni Salad
-Coleslaw
-Baked Beans
-Mac & Cheese
-Green Beans

Unfortunately, no collard greens or black eyed peas!  But you can't have everything.  I will mention that the green beans are just mainly reheated from the can, so I mainly skip that.  The baked beans are very good, and their mac & cheese is actually pretty stellar.  I also enjoy their potato salad.

Combos and meals come with slices of white bread if you request, but don't forget to ask!  It won't always come with it included.  Also, get some extra BBQ sauce!  I know the sauce may be bottled, but they let it simmer on the side most of the day, so the flavor does concentrate nicely.  The hot BBQ sauce has a nice kick so watch out.  Kaboom!  It's overall great eats, just don't forget extra napkins and extra wet wipes!  It will get messy.  Which one of you city people eat BBQ with a knife and fork?  That's what the white bread is for!

Another item I usually order when we eat at Road Kill Grill is a sandwich.  They load these suckers nicely so you get a nice portion of meat and sauce to bread.  Basically a meal in itself!  I enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular.  This with extra hot BBQ sauce on top, and a side of coleslaw?  Classic.  

BBQ can be a very picky topic, so you will see tons of varying reviews on John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill.  This is because depending on what side of the country you are from, you have a different taste of what BBQ should be.  Some like tomato based, some like vinegar based, some like mustard based, and so forth and so forth.  Some folks like more smoke, some folks like less smoke, Hell, some folks like their BBQ baked in an oven instead.  But no matter what, we all like good food.  And I think Road Kill Grill overall has good food.

Give them a try for yourself.  You might like, but then again you might NOT like.  Many reviews for this place are in the 3 or 4-star range, I tracked over to the 4-star area because I like it here.  In a place like Las Vegas it's difficult to find good 'Que that's not from a place like Famous Dave's or Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nuff' said.

* Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. * 

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef "devil dawgs" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.

===================
Arrived back from a terrific meal at Beckett's Table!  Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!  

As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.

Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start??
Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what "ricard" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked "the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?"  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said "get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!"  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!

The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in "Six Billion Dollar Man" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially ("no ordinary pasta," said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!

Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.

So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.

I'll be back- thanks BT!

I am really in two minds about this place, a second visit will be needed, by then I hope they have the place running smoothly AND they take notice of a couple of reviews on here, mine and CF would be a good start.

We showed up early, just after 5, as the only customers in the place I was happy to be greeted and sat immediately.

The menu is ok, no where near as extensive as some Tapas places I have been to, but there should be a couple of dishes for everyone

The drinks, yep I have to agree here with CF, taking a thin glass, filling it with ice, then adding a very small amount of liquid isn't the way to go, design over use strikes again, you can get away with that if you are serving premium drinks, but these are not premium.

I really need to get this out of the way now, this place screams of an owner thinking about what he likes rather than what his desired customers would like. The seating looks good, but in reality isn't that comfortable and the music choice...Where do I begin, ok, they are aiming for a hip crowd, fair enough, but hip crowds also have kids, gangsta rap really isn't the best idea in the world, to be playing in a restaurant at 5pm, I personally can just block it out, but with the demographic of the area (predominantly older) yeah they may have issues....I totally get that a restaurant should be an extension of the owner/chef, but a neighborhood tapas place isn't the right venue....Anyways food for thought.

On to the important stuff, the food. :

There are some very good dishes, then there are some that I really just wanted to run in the kitchen, grab one of the iron skillets and smack the chef upside the head, just so I could get a clear picture of what he was thinking.

The sticky bun tacos, very nice, the pork belly pieces could have been a bit bigger, but overall a good dish.

Monte Cristo, certainly one of the gems, a great combination.

gai satay, I was in two minds about this dish, I love traditional satay, this is not a traditional version, but after my second piece I decided I liked it, leaving the skin on gives it a slightly different taste and a way different texture.

The Hodgepodge....Ok, this is the dish that had me almost running to the kitchen and is the main reason this place got 3 stars instead of 4 (well ok, hearing the F bomb dropped every 10 seconds for the first 20 minutes we were there also helped, but mostly this dish).

If you are going to open a Tapas restaurant, DO NOT BUY AND SERVE products purchased from US Foods or Crisco, the potato tots I can forgive in this respect, but french fries and sweet potato fries directly from the bag, you have got to be kidding me.

Make the fries fresh, it's easy to do, cheaper for the restaurant and they taste better. A way better dish would be just taking the tater tots by themselves, they tasted great, the fries tasted just like they had come from a bag, sad.

For dessert, well actually I was going to pass, but the cream cheese lote sounded good, so we decided to split it.....And there was the best dish of the night perfect texture, great taste, the only let down was the fork, it wasn't plastic, but it was one of those that are so thin, when you look at them they bend and in fact, ours did bend, yes a crepe (call it Thai flat bread if you like it isn't, but whatever) bent two forks....

This place has potential, but it needs a reality check or it won't be around long, the staff are pleasant, the service quick and friendly, this could be a great place with just a little thought put into it.

They (countless Internet people with sexy six-pack abs I follow on Twitter & Instagram) say that the secret to having a six-pack abs is not the workout sessions at the gym, but mostly (let's say 75%) because of what you eat.  With that said, all the gym rats and fitness minded folks with goals of obtaining or maintaining their six-packs, you do not have to avoid the SLS Buffet... on your cheat day.

The rest of the people that are normal (even extra normal) and more well rounded (pun intended) in the waistline department, come as often as you like (Note: You can earn 2 complimentary SLS Buffet passes with 500 slot points).  Having a few meals here will definitely help you maintain your corpulent rotundness, making you just that much more beloved by Jenny Craig. 

So I know I been watching what I eat recently. So if it wasn't for the SLS grand opening and the "obsession?" to check out new places and leave a trail blazer report for the rest of the Yelp Pals, my better judgement would have grounded me and kept me on my granola with dried blueberries diet.  But I suck at being rational when it comes to food and women. So here I am at home now, writing my review.

First of all, SLS being the latest casino property to open to the general public in LV (as of Aug 23, 2014), with nice modern facelift to update what used to be the Sahara, of course has a modern looking buffet.  It is not huge or fancy like Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it is still way better than the one at the Palms.  On opening weekend, the dinner is $40.  So it is not cheap. But still in the same ballpark as the rest of the also ran buffet contenders.

The dining area and also the serving stations look pretty good.  The decorations seems (okay, not gonna sugar coat it), is half complete for the serving stations.  The shelves above is only decorated on about 60% of the buffet (Asian dim sum section to just past the mid point (carving station). Not sure if it was a budget thing, or not getting in all the decorations elements (enameled cast iron cookware), but the bulk of the decoration is noticeably lopsided. Not a big thing, and will not affect the quality of the food served, but it is just one of those attention to details thing.  The seats and tables in the dining area is comfortable and spaced well, so you do not feel cramped or boxed in (Good job!).

The buffet has the usual snow crab legs, some fresh clams, cooked shrimp, prime rib carving station (prime rib was good), dessert station (it is a large island of baked goods, not too much variety though, with some special highlights I will discuss later), a large Asian & dim sum section.  But overall I was not really impressed.  No serious WOW factor. But it is not terrible either.  Pretty A-Okay,with definite room for easy & significant improvements.

Let me cover what I do like about this buffet.

* Layout of the savory stations is straight forward. No lines per say to wait, just go in for the prize, wherever you see what caught your gleaming eyes.
* Plenty of large plates on the bottom shelf for you to pick up and pile on your build your own feast.
* Small portions available for self service, which is refreshed with newer back ups. So you get fairly fresh dishes throughout your meal.
* The line was very short. Hardly any wait, but you do have to look for the buffet or wonder successfully to this part of the SLS property.

* Fresh fried doughnuts tossed in cinnamon sugar. [Highlight of the meal]

* Dried Blueberries [Not sure what you would eat this with, but I was happy to just snack on these plain]
* Sushi was fresh.
* Pastas are all good.
* Gelato was tasty & serving was generous (compared to all the buffets I tried further south of SLS).

Could be better:

* Crepe maker's skill is really at the novice of novice level.  I think he is dreading it, and it shows in the final odd shaped product. The batter is spread thin and overcooked in sections, while thick and under-cooked in others.
* Crepe station ingredients are not stored properly for service or needs to be reformulated. (Chocolate and Nutella are so thick you can't portion it let alone make designs with them. Mixing it with 10% oil or holding it at higher temperature (melting point) would make more sense.
* Dim Sum section has great variety but sometimes you just like a lot of shumai (just an example). So should I leave with 3 bamboo steaming baskets or just consolidate right there.
* Dim sum portions for some items seems too big (chicken feet, the steam buns), I know I opted out, since I don't want to waste food.
* Steamed Basmati rice was dried and crusty. Maybe smaller portions is better or have a cover for it.
* Dessert selections is fairly limited. It looks full, but the same desserts are scattered on almost all sides of the large dessert island.

For $40 (weekend dinner) I thought it was okay, and worth checking out for the sake of checking it out (even some SLS employees agreed).  $30 is a no brainer. $35 is a toss up. 3 stars!

One day, my je'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated. 

"I'm not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I'm trying to find somewhere to eat - I'm hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day. 

"Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there's a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe's nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw) 

"POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we'll go home and you can make some!"

"Awww... come on! It's prolly the only place around here anyway!"

So we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren't they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb. 

When we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over.

"oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom.

"Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!

"the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn't." 

"oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I'm so sorry to say this) disgusting! I'm sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It's too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it's best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey. 

We were both a little grossed out at the thought of the 'indian dessert' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it's called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco). 

We started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I'm glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.

The bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili's flavor but was disappointed it wasn't very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco. 

We wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I'm glad the service was quick and friendly and I'm even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.

the prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla! 

To my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn't anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you're in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don't wanna hear about one of ya'll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.

Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large "Onion Loaf" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the "Chopped Salad" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes" and "Lyonnaise Potatoes" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the "Key Lime Pie" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing "lime" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)

I tip my hat off entirely to yelp for this find because without the yelp reviews, I would have probably never driven by this shop in the first place and if I did, I probably wouldn't have stopped. But thanks to the world of yelp, I know better! 

I can finally say that after months and months of reading up on the yelp reviews, I have officially tried The Meat Shop. The verdict? A+. A+ indeed! This week, we were celebrating a birthday and a birthday calls for the finest of feasts! Since we decided to make it a night in instead of a night out, I knew that it was time to check out The Meat Shop. I arrived at 3rd and Buckeye and passed it the first time by accident, but I quickly turned around and pulled into the parking lot. The only indication that it's there is a small sign and a large painted pig on the front. I walked inside to find a very humble store of only a small entry, counter and a large window that let me look straight inside to the butcher chopping his meat in front of my very eyes! It was definitely a sight and especially since Phoenix lacks many butchers in this fine city. In fact, I can't name many other shops that are only butcher shops. It's a lost art. 

I went to The Meat Shop knowing that their beef is top notch and their bacon is a must-try, especially after reading up on Scott W's review and seeing the pictures on yelp. Sadly, I am not that well-versed in my cuts of meat, so a butcher could have sold me a cow's right ankle saying it was filet mignon and I wouldn't have known the difference. But luckily Paul the butcher helped me out and he steered me in the right direction. Paul suggested I get the Tenderloin and a filet. The filet was for me and I asked him to keep it small (several weddings this summer so I must watch the waistline!) So he disappeared into the back to grab the meat and came out with two beautiful cuts (pictures included on the page). What caught my eye was that they were wrapped air tight and ready to be frozen if I chose to. Paul also pointed out that the cuts had barely (if any) fat on them, so they were very lean. Good for my waistline then right? All the meat is also locally raised without any added hormones, etc. 

So I had my meat, but I couldn't leave without some bacon. Did I need bacon? No. But could I visit The Meat Shop without buying bacon? Nope. I asked Paul which bacon was best and of course he brought me out all three styles and each style looked tasty. There was the bacon slab, sliced bacon and buckboard bacon. I ended up purchasing some with the excuse that "of course homemade three cheese macaroni could use some bacon..." So yes, I put bacon in the mac 'n cheese. 

The purchasing experience was extremely pleasant and I was appreciative to Paul for walking me through my purchase and helping me with my meatucation. He also told me that the meat would keep in the refrigerator for up to a week and then could be frozen as long as I liked.

I got home and first fried up the bacon. I've never seen bacon sizzle so perfectly. Imagine what the bacon looks like in a Christmas movie when it's frying in a pan. This is what it looked like. Completely perfect. It tasted just as perfect (I had to have a bite!) It was like I was in my own Christmas movie with the beauty of this bacon. The next day, we grilled the steaks and after adding olive oil and garlic salt, the steak was ready to eat. I was told that a good steak doesn't need A-One sauce. Did this one need it? No siree! 

I will definitely be back to The Meat Shop, but the only downfall is that it's not exactly cheap and it's kind of a drive for me, so for that, I will leave my visits to The Meat Shop for a special occasion.

Discount alert! When I was there, I also saw a sign for 50% off the meat that they had to freeze. Deal worth driving to for!

You can serve me terrible food.
You can mix me a crappy cocktail. 
Your ambiance can fall flat. 
You can even charge me more than I want to pay.

But take note Tempest (and really any other business in Madison and beyond) you can't be complacent. I mean you can, but I will not patronize your business nor will I recommend it. 

When you turn the lights on, polish flatware and open your doors you are entering into an agreement with those that are coming to spend money that you want their business. But after 4 visits and an event that I unfortunately brought 28 people out for, you have done nothing to make me think you a. want my business, b. care to make money. So I have to ask... why show up to work? 

Tonight was the last straw. My friend and I were sitting at the bar for ten minutes before someone came over not to ask us what we wanted to drink or to show us menus, but to stand there. To stand there and look at us blankly until we asked if happy hour was still going on. He said yes and lobbed the conversation back our way, didn't go over the happy hour specials of which there are many. I felt terrible for suggesting we grab light bites and drinks to this friend who had never been to Tempest. 

*flash forward*

I'm not eating sugar right now and the brown sugar sauce that tops their scallops is entirely too sweet, so I asked for seared scallops with the bacon lardons that typically top the dish but not the sauce. I explained if the kitchen wasn't interested in accommodating my request and leaving the sauce out, I'd find something else. Surprise, the scallops came out with the cloyingly sweet sauce and this is how the next few moments went:

BARTENDER: Yeah, I said just the scallops and lardons, so maybe they can't separate the lardons from the sauce? 
COREY: Ok, well I don't eat sugar, so I can't really eat these, there's no way to get just seared scallops, no sauce?
BARTENDER: I mean, that's what I asked for, so I guess they can't do it. Did you want these? 
(I'm sort of fuming at this point)
COREY: No, I mean I can't do the sugar so....
BARTENDER: They'd be on the house.

GO TO THE KITCHEN AND SAY THESE CAME UP WRONG, CAN YOU SIMPLY SEAR SCALLOPS AND PUT BACON ON THEM? What's the challenge here? 

*flash forward some more*

Drinks went empty, food was eaten, and it took forever to catch someone's eye to get refills or order more. Why? Because it was more important for a gaggle of servers to talk with the bartenders about what a proper wine pour looks like. I counted 5 at one point staring at the same glass of white wine, then repeating this behavior 15 and 25 minutes later. So detail oriented.

Last up, the gent that cases the joint, a manager I assume, does laps around the restaurant every time I've been there, but never asks how we're doing. And that's really the crux of my issue. I know full well a business can't be 100% "on" 100% of the time, we all have bad days. But when leadership at the top has no vested interest in how people spending hard earned money feel about their establishment, that trickles down, and I want no part of it. 

There are plenty of restaurants in town that serve seafood by people who are interested in striking up conversation, making menu recommendations and righting wrongs that may occur when things go awry in the kitchen. I'll go to those places, a giant wooden boat and tea lights don't do it for me.

I had eaten at the Earl of Sandwich on the strip a few times and liked it, but never new we had another location at the Palms. That was until I got a coupon booklet in the mail for a variety of places at the Palms, Earl of Sandwich being one of them. I signed up for the Earl of Sandwich e-club after the first time I ate at the strip location and for my birthday this year they sent a coupon good for 1 free sandwich and 1 free drink, no purchase required. Score! Since I had the coupon from the booklet at the palms with a BOGO and the birthday coupon this seemed like the perfect time to try the location at the Palms and eat for almost free. :)

This Earl of Sandwich is located in the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino, between Chronic Tacos and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It is open 24/7. The one thing I noticed different about this location from the other one on the strip is they have no inside seating. You have to find a table (not many) in the middle of the food court. Also, the "order here" and "pick up here" lines are very close together. While placing my order I had to move out of the way and stop placing my order twice so that other customers could get their food. They need to really make some adjustments as far as where people should place an order and pick one up. 

The girl at the register who took my order was very friendly and polite. She had trouble getting one of the coupon codes to scan and after she asked the manager for help several times,  was finally able to get it on her own. I felt bad that the manager was ignoring her and talking on her cel phone instead. They had a promotion going on called "Dine with the Royal Couple" that offered 2 sandwiches not regularly on the menu. The 2 sandwiches were the "Avocado BLT" and "Pastrami Reuben" both priced at $6.99, but I used the BOGO and ordered 1 of each. I left off the kraut and thousand island dressing and just requested mustard be put on it. I usually would love having the sandwich the way it came, but hubby doesn't like the other stuff so we just customized it a bit since we were sharing each sandwich. The Pastrami Reuben was very good, but skimpy on the meat. Hubby would have to eat 2 of these to get full. The Avocado BLT was also very good except some bacon pieces were too fatty while the other pieces has great meaty flavor. The bacon was cooked fresh so kudos for that. All the sandwiches are made fresh to order here. They were generous with the fresh avocado too. So for the free sandwich from the birthday coupon I ordered a "Full Montagu" priced at $6.49, but of course the awesome coupon took care of that! The Full Montagu has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato and mustard sauce. I had them leave off the lettuce. So with everything I said was in the Full Montagu you would expect something pretty big right? Nope! This sandwich was very good, but again just too skimpy on what they put between the bread. With the coupons we did get full though! I do like that the sandwiches are generally under $6.49 so even if hubby needs to order 2 to get full, it really isn't any more in price then ordering a burger and fries at a average restaurant. 

Earl of Sandwich also offers a variety of salads, wraps and artisan soups (soup selection changes daily). They also have sides like coleslaw, potato salad, pasta salad and chips. Breakfast is served daily until 11 am and they use fresh cracked eggs! There is a kids menu and when it comes to dessert Earl of Sandwich has a lot of tasty looking sweets, including brownies made with Ghirardelli chocolate.

I don't throw the following sentence out very often but when I do, I mean business so here it goes...I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. I am not exaggerating. So if you stop reading this review right this second, at least you know and now you can you get into the car, make your way to Mesa and try one for yourself. 

So on to the rest of the review. I've been lucky enough to have an Ike's sandwich in SF and couldn't believe my eyes when I found out they were moving to Arizona. Their location is a bit of a drive for me, but the sandwich truly makes it worth it. 

Here's how the experience works. This is a casual sandwich eatery where you can come in solo, order and take it to go, or dine in with a couple friends. Anything goes at Ike's. Now, when you walk in, you'll immediately be overwhelmed by a board listing off a variety of every sandwich combo imaginable and it's not your run of the mill sandwich combo. No way. It's a combo of everything good in life that's put in between two slices of bread and served either hot or cold, depending on your sandwich. I suggest looking at Yelp reviews, pictures and the menu before you arrive to avoid major menu anxiety like I experienced. Also, note that every sandwich has a hilariously funky name so you might get lost in translation just simply reading the names! 

Once you've made your sandwich selection, you'll order at the counter from one of the incredibly friendly staff and they are truly genuinely friendly! It was such a breath of fresh air to experience a sandwich at Ike's. The decor is just as fun and funky as the staff and sandwich choices and be sure to look on your napkin holder because it will tell you something pretty about you! 

Now on to the best part, the sandwich. I don't even know where to begin. First, they serve this special bread that typically can only be found in N. Cal and it's amazing. Cheese is baked into the bread. I tried the Bella which is their most popular and I'm not surprised. It's a combo of chicken that has been slow-cooked for several hours and then tossed in this delicious honey mustard. Then they top it with cheese, avocado and this special mayo spread. I suggest adding some hot sauce to it. It's served hot and it is large and in charge, so unless you're ready for a last supper meal you will probably have some left-overs or your might want to share. It's worth every single calorie consumed and then some. 

Now, although this is about a 15-20 minute drive from my house, I will absolutely be visiting on a regular basis and can't wait for them to open additional locations!

PS - if you get lost, it's across the street from the mall!

After a busy and exciting first day back in school (last semester in college was seven years ago!), I was hungry and unsuccessful in finding anything interesting near the college.  I decided to find something close to home, but was distracted and missed my exit.  I soon found myself near Gainey Ranch.  I spotted a new restaurant there and decided to check it out, and soon found myself in the parking lot of not where I wanted to go to, but of My Fit Foods.  From the outside, MFF looked like a GNC, or a vitamin shop.  A quick check on the Yelp app confirmed that it was a pre-packaged health food place where I might find something quick to eat.

I went in and headed straight to the refrigerated section to see what everyone else was searching through and found pre-packaged foods from floor-to-ceiling.  There were breakfast items, such as burrito wraps and oatmeal combos, as well as small to large servings of lunch and dinner options, as well as some snack items.  Since these were pre-packaged, I quickly decided I'd have to look for nutritional and ingredients' info online, or I would be taking a lot of someone's precious time investigating for food allergens.  I met Brian, who quickly kept me from leaving, and instead, told me he would help me w/ identifying which foods I would have to stay away from.  A few minutes later, we were left w/ less than two handfuls' of items to choose from-- what a friendly and upbeat guy!  (Qualities of a great salesman.)  He even invited me to take a dish home to try, gratis!  

I asked if there was a membership I could sign up for, and he said yes, I could open up a "house account," where for $500, I would save 5% on purchases, whereby giving me $525 to spend however I choose, whenever I choose.  I could walk in and choose the items I wanted, or I could place the order online or by phone, and then come in whenever it's convenient for me (during business hours, that is) to pick up my order.  If I only didn't have so many food allergies to contend with, I think the products here are a convenient way to ensure I eat healthily, following a low-carb 40/40/20 diet, and lose weight, if I choose to.  I must admit that while the tofu, spinach, salsa, and quinoa-stuffed yellow bell pepper meal I tried was bland at the start, after adding a little bit of salt, it was actually quite delicious, and very satisfying!  Thank you for the inspiration on how to prepare a new dish, Brian!  

While I may not become a regular customer, I would definitely recommend My Fit Foods to anyone I know who would like to be able to eat healthier and lose weight, and who would not want to, or could not, prepare every meal they eat themselves.  These pre-packaged foods are perfect to take w/ you to work.  Just heat, and eat!  

A quick note: There is a nutritionist on-staff, who you may speak with if you have any other concerns that a regular staffer may not be able to address, although Brian was very thorough.  I'm not sure, but I would think that getting a more-personalized menu might be possible.  I'll have to inquire more the next time I stop by to confirm this!

I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes" were just average. The "Cheese Bread" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The "Carmalized Bananas" were actually very good, but the "Crispy Polenta" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the "Papaya Cream" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.

This is the second time a club in a Wynn property has embarrassed me in front of friends/colleagues. 

Let me preface this review by saying that I know Labor Day Weekend in Las Vegas is nuts. I've been partying in Vegas for the better part of five years now; it's the second most expensive/busy weekend of the year or something to that effect.

That said, I booked a cabana here fully prepared to spend a lot of money. And I am the EASIEST person to help. No wacky requests, nothing. Just take my money and give me what I'm told I'm getting. I showed up with a bunch of my friends and we had a minimum spend of $2k (which is realistically more like $3k), which I thought was totally reasonable for the cabana that particular night. It was no problem, but the holier than thou attitude that I got from some of the staff was extremely off-putting. Yes, I know you're busy. Yes, I know you're stressed. But if I'm buying bottles and bottles at a 1000% markup... be a little nicer. Smile. Take five minutes to make sure we're all set. Don't ignore me when I need help. You're supposed to be bending over backwards for me, you're a VIP host. Customer service goes a long way. I'm not going to name any names in my review, but I am going to be honest.

So we waited in line for about 10 minutes before getting in. Totally standard, no problem. But, when we got in, the cabana I was promised was mysteriously unavailable. Instead, I was offered a daybed. I politely refused and asked to speak with a manager. This was embarrassing, since I was entertaining friends from out of town, and had kind of been hyping up the night since Surrender is the hot spot.

The manager came by, and I ended up having to kick him $200 to "upgrade" me to what I was promised originally. This is after I had already tipped out over $400 to the hosts and door staff. It's not like I didn't take care of my people; this wasn't my first rodeo. Tangentially, I know I'm breaking all the rules by mentioning that I tipped out, but fuck it. I'm pissed. I had been pre-authed the night before for the cabana, I had confirmed it twice, and then I got bait-and-switched. Not happy, Surrender. If you wanted to sell the cabana for a higher price to someone else, fucking tell me before I show up with a group, and don't you dare try to pull a bait and switch.

Anyway, we finally get up to the cabana and got our drinks a full hour after we arrived at the door. The host I had booked the table through passed me off to someone else, and (thankfully) he was fantastic, friendly, thorough. Our waitress was sort of around, our bussers friendly, our security fine. No above and beyond; if anything, the service was worse than I expected. The club itself was gorgeous and the night was beautiful, which is the only reason that this place isn't getting one star. Seriously, it was ridiculous. I'd give the club and the ambiance 5 stars, but the staff was less than stellar that night. In a city of hospitality, I was not impressed.

MIdway through the night, I had two friends get in touch with me to join the party. No problem, right? Wrong. My hosts told them my party was full, they had to wait in line, pay a $75 cover. It's a little absurd, considering we were going to purchase two more bottles when they came in, and they were just given a flat out no when they asked to join our party. I stepped outside to speak with a host - I wasn't even drunk - and I was given the cold shoulder. I produced another $100, he palmed it,  still didn't help my friends. Laughing.

All I have to say is, if Surrender treats the people who spend a ton of money this way, I can't even imagine coming here without table reservations. I learned an expensive lesson at the Encore, and this isn't the first time the Wynn staff has treated me like a second class citizen (see my XS review). Is my money different or something?

Overall, less than pleased. I will say this, though; if I ever return, I'd be more apt to return during the day than the night, and it'll be on someone else's dime so I don't have to deal with anybody.

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.

A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.

We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.

About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.

The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.

Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.

Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.

Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.

About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.

Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.

Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

My first choccy festival!  I've longed to be part of this "affaire" since reading of its existence in the spring of '03, the year I moved to the valley.  I finally went, and I'm already looking forward to next year's!

Planning on grabbing something to eat before attending the festival, and not able to spot anything intriguing on my way to 59th and Glendale aves, I parked at the free public garage an hour before the event's commencement.  No sooner than when I exited my car did my brain register that yes, I'll be consuming a lot of chocolates this afternoon :D  The aroma of chocolates was definitely evident, even though the lot was relatively void of attendees.  Oh, this is going to be fun!  But first, I had to get some nutritious sustenance.  

First tent I spotted was for the making of chocolate pizza, with Cerreta's providing the tempered chocolate.  There was already a line of people waiting to make theirs, and it was only 4p; My chances of scoring some food looked pretty good!  However, it wasn't going to be chocolate pizza, since the chocolate contained * (I asked).  A-ha!  I spotted some food vendors just ahead...

Funnel cakes, Euro Gyros, Crepe Tyme, Alice Cooperstown's Coop-zookies, hot fudge brownie sundaes, and The Big Unit... whoa!  Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this hotdog, but I hadn't realized how big it really is!  (16"?!?)  Too bad I left my cell in the car (I retrieved it after I had something to eat), or it would be among the pics above.  Cooperstown also had BBQ pork sammies ($6 ea.), *-free, but I'd have to wait since they weren't quite ready, so I kept walking.  There were chile burgers, corn dogs, teriyaki chicken 'n pork on sticks, lo mein, and chocolate-covered potato chips.  Honey Bear's BBQ too was there, but their one BBQ sauce contained *... pass.  (Hmm... is it me, or don't the choices of vendors present seemed odd to pair w/ chocolate?  I wondered, "What selections would I encounter if I were to attend San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square Chocolate Festival?")  

Beverage-wise, there were snow cones, cherry-lemonades, hot and cold cocoas, lattes, frappes, Budweiser beers, and Kokopelli wines.  There was even Zemer's homemade rootbeer, made w/ genuine sassafras from trees planted by the current owner Chris' grandfather.  (I didn't approach Chris until after stuffing myself w/ samples 'n goat milk fudge, pecans, 2 pork sammies, 2 glasses of wine, a dark-choc. pecan patty ($2 ea.), and not one, but TWO smore's on sticks ($3 ea.), so I couldn't even imagine ingesting anything else at that point.  Shame, since who knows when I'll cross paths with Chris' *-free concoction again?)

Since I was striking out on food, I approached a few chocolate vendors hawking samples.  Corn ingredients kept me out of the game from the first few already: Cerreta's caramel apples, Belgian waffles and ice cream, Mackinac Island fudge.  Wei of Chocolate was a delectable possibility, but I was looking for more... oomph.  I found it in Fossil Creek Creamery's goat milk fudge (2 boxes, $6.50 ea.) and Amour Chocolates.  I tried samples of the bars: dark choc. chile, dark choc. cherry pecan, white choc. espresso crunch, white choc. chile, etc.  All quite good!  So good, in fact, that I bought 20 bars!  $1.95 per, or buy three or more @ $1.75 each.  (I'd post pics, but it seems like all of the choc bars are aesthetically defective.  Update: Trisha called back and said I can return and replace them, postage-free.)  Next came Nutz About Nuts!  Oh, the aromas from this tent sent me reeling in a state of bliss!  One moment I was sampling a cinnamon-anonanon pecan and a sweet jalapeno pecan, and the next moment I was forking out $20 for 4 packs (or $6 ea.).  OK, back to real food, please!

Corn, corn, everywhere forced me to have Cooperstown's BBQ pork sammy and a glass of Kokopelli Winery's merlot.  Wanted a glass of their pinot noir since samples of cabernet sauvignon and merlot did not impress, but the "wine only" side didn't have any pinot noir to sell (??).  One complaint: A sign stated "Glass of wine $4, $5 Wine with souvenir wine glass," and yet, there weren't any glasses to take home.  Many attendees were bummed about that.  Me, too,  But only for a sec.  Who wants a plastic wine glass, anyway, and hey!  Chocolate smooths out ALL the kinks, if you ask me :D

Must go to sleep (it's 4a!).  What a fun-filled second-half of the day I had... I was there for almost 6 hours!!  

P.S.  Awesome tunes, too!  All of the performers rocked!

2nd Amour choc update: Was told last week not to send chocs back, but that defective chocs would be replaced as soon as new batches were made.  Still waiting.

3rd Amour choc update: Received batches of chocs. in great condition!

The only thing that could've possibly made my meal at The Estate House any worse, is if we had to pay for it...

My bf and I stopped by for a drink on the night of their grand opening about 2 weeks ago... it was beautiful and the staff was pleasant; many of them my bf knew from previous workplaces.  So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!

The meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  

Although Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...

The menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.

One thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with "Warm Camembert," toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  

So, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...

So, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the "Estate House Fruit De Mer" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  

We basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!

Fortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.

The Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.

Tiesto?  Friday night on July 4 weekend?  

Our friend said, "I got us on the guest list."  

I said, "Did you tell them there's one guy?  And I'm not going to have to wait in the main line am I?"

Our friend messages the promoter again and he says, "Sure, not a problem but for guys it is the standard $100 cover to get in."

The girls were shocked.  $100? Really?  I had to tell them, yeah, it sucks to be a guy, but that's a typical rate for a guy trying to get into a club on a weekend that has a big name DJ.  I don't mind (I'm not one that complains about things when the going rate is the going rate).  Pre-sale tickets for guys are always $60-$100 vs. being only $30-$50 for girls for all of these clubs with EDM DJs.

So lucky me, getting to be the hot dog between three female buns.   We arrived in the guest list line at 10:30 and it took us just 40 minutes to get to the front of that (it's Friday, it's packed).  Mainly parties of girls in the guest line with a couple of guys here and there.   

We get to the iPad check-in girls and they find our name.  3 girls, 1 guy.  Then the girl looks confused and goes to ask the other check-in girl something.  Then she comes back to us with a ticket marked... 3 girls check in the "C" box.  1 guy check in the "C" box.  We get to the cashier.  She takes our ticket.  The bouncer near the cashier is really chill, we are just talking and joking with him while waiting to go through the last ropes.  ALL OF US ARE IN FOR FREE!  

You go upstairs.  Ladies with heels, there are a lot of them!  Level 3 is hip hop.  It's a rectangular floor with bars at each end.  Service was fast at both sides.  Drinks are about $15-$18 each.  Playing old school and newer hip-hop, I liked this room the best for dancing.  The dance floor was packed, but there was still room to dance.  

Level 4 is where the EDM DJ of the night holds court.  It's huge.  There are go go girls walking, posing, dancing on elevated areas on the edges.  They are costumed and look like a cross between a Paris fashion show/ Cirque Du Soleil/Gothy Jean Paul Gaultier.  

To get to the main dance floor you have to walk down.  There are tables/booths set up in arena seating style and then a sunken pit/dance floor.  It's live down there but not that fun because you're mashed chest to chest/butt to butt with whoever's next to you.  You're wondering how you can dance in no space and then 40 seconds later somebody walks by and wants to pass through.  

It's huge, there are lots of booths, the dance floor is big, but the configuration isn't optimal.  If you buy a table facing the dance floor, you get a table with a view, but it's so detached and elevated that you don't really feel like you are in the middle of the action. It's like sitting in a suite at basketball or hockey game.  You're at the game, but you're not really with the crowd.  If I pay for a table, I want some exclusivity, but I also want people to pass by and have the feeling that I can leave my table, take two steps, and be dancing, whether in an aisle or on the main floor.  I didn't get that feeling here.  

There are even more tables farther back away from the main arena area (the Pavilion).  These tables are hurtin'.  You can't even see the dance floor from most of those table.  If I sprung $1000-$1500 for one of these lesser tables,  I would feel really cheated.  There's no bar by them, people can't really dance in the aisles.  You have limited or no view of the DJ.  Chicks are not going to want to come up to a table that far away.  

I kept on reading about this impressive waterfall in all the publication reviews.  I had to see it, because it sounded like water was flowing from massive rocks down and through.  It took me forever to find it because it was in the corner and... it's lame.  It's a tall dark stone slab that has water coming straight down.  Ever walked into a friends' house foyer and see a slim seven foot high flat stone water structure that you can buy and plug in?  It's like that, just way larger.  So overrated.

The best "hidden" spot to get a drink, sit and relax without having to get a VIP table is the Ling Ling Lounge, which is off to the side but on the same floor as the Ling Ling (Hip-Hop) Club.  The Ling Ling Lounge is surprisingly empty, but you can sit in chairs or lounge pieces and chill out.  It has a brown/red tint to the room, so if you see that you know you're in the right place.  

***Quick & Dirty Summary***

Top rate DJ lineup... Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Steve Aoki, Deadmau5, etc.  Massive, impressive club that should be checked out for it's sheer grandiose and design.  The bartenders and staff were all nice and efficient.  Drinks are normal Vegas club pricey. The regular line to get in is super long.  If you are guest listed, get in line by 10:45, as they might stop letting people in at 11:15-11:30.   I really don't like how the EDM floor is set up.  I just wish there was room to dance here.

Fresh herbs and produce, menu items under 600 calories, low sodium, no hfcs and everything made fresh to order is what made me excited for LYFE. 

It's been open a little over a week now. Located at The District Green Valley on the side where Whole Foods is. 

LYFE acronym for L.ove Y.our F.ood E. veryday is more fast/casual style to where you get in line, order and pay at the counter, seat yourself and food is brought out to you via high tech way of their GPS tracker. Cool huh? Well as long as your server doesn't take off with the round disc before you get all your food. Twice, when I was there it happened and both times the servers were at a lost as to where to find me. So TIP #1 ..don't let the servers take your disc until you get all of your orders!

Initially I was impressed on a first visit. Ordered a side Kale salad, Chocolate Budino and LYFE specialty water Hibiscus Beet. The drink was refreshing more lemony than sweet. The pudding was creamy and chocolaty! Love how it's made coconut milk, dark chocolate,agave,pomegranate chia seeds  It was an all natural and overall a healthier dessert! The side kale salad was paired with a lemon dressing..but in this case it was doused with lemon and pepper? It ended up being too bitter for me.

Second visit for breakfast next morning. It indicates they are open at 7am and 2 employees I asked the day before verified it. Well got there at little after 8 and even though there were employees inside, lead manager I spoke to when I walked in said it was not ready to open and will open later at 11 and start their regular business hours starting the next day. No apologies just straight up told me and turned back around and went about his business. Alrighty then. 

Third visit later that evening with Terri R. My order was for sweet fries, their delicious chocolate pudding again and orange ginger chia drink.Terri got the Unfried Chicken entree. Verdict: Skip Unfried Chicken dish. I only had 2 bites, that was enough for me. The chicken breast was uneven, ie one side thicker than the other which ended up being overcooked, too dry and lacked seasoning. Since there was veggies still left on Terri's plate, I went ahead tried it. It was under cooked! Even the baked garlic parm sweet fries I got were poorly executed. That too was under cooked. Sigh. 

I get ingredients used are higher quality and portion wise it's smaller to stay under the 600 cal limit. For the price they charge  though over ten dollars, I thought this particular entree was NOT worth it.

Fourth visit ..finally breakfast! It's served only till 11am.  Thumbs up for the quinoa buttermilk pancakes! Hurrah! Usually whole grain pancakes end up being too dry. But adding blueberries (extra .99)  in it helped add enough moisture. Every bite had warm blueberries with quinoa   At 4.99 this superfoods breakfast is a great deal!  It's a winner in my book. Skip the chipotle potato hash though...either they forgot to season it, or not enough seasoning..but was just blah! 

Touching on service. Front end cashiers friendly and efficient. The line moved fairly quickly. Staff on the floor needs work. 3 different employees had 3 different answers when asked a simple question "What time was closing?" It's emphasized they are all about being locally SOURCED yet no one knew where they get their produce. One of their management staff employee didn't even now how to pronounce the name of their breakfast entree correctly. Psst FYI ...Quinoa (it's Kin Wah not Kin No Wah). If you are newbie I totally understand but if you are running the place that's a different story. 

Ambiance, very inviting and reason why I like it here. It's spacious, plenty of seating both inside and outdoors. They even have a patio chairs and a dog bowl with water set outside. Love the natural lighting and decor ..a walled fresh herbal garden. The furnishings all modern. 

Fast forward a week later, Already slacking. There was a post it note that the sparkling water was out. While the tables are wiped clean, the floors were unswept and under the tables had bits of food debris...yeah...and they were slow to get my order out to me. 

Overall though everyone was working hard to please the customer. Even the president and CEO of LYFE(and former McDonalds CEO)  Mike Roberts (he ntroduced himself later) was real hands on and was busy emptying out trash from the bathrooms when I ran into him on the grand opening day.

I applaud LYFE caters to the health conscientious crowd.  I like it and will come back for breakfast and refuel spot for now. This place is borderline 2 stars "I Had Better" because if given a choice between other healthy choices in the area I still would choose Sunrise Coffee and Rachel's. But saving grace are the drinks, quinoa pancakes and dessert. SO bumped to 3 stars and a A-OKAY! I'm over the new kid on the block though, but dont miss out on LYFE!

This is the sort of review that the Liberty Market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with.  They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.

So we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.

Well all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.

We got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...

the worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with "talk to the (paw print)" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.

WOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.
WOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.
WOMAN: (orders fifty more things)
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)
WOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.

So I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.

A couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?

Fat person code: (I am an authority)
1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.
2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.
3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.

Anyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...

Our red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. 

There were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify "fresh") red velvet cake.

Having said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.

__________________

**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promise

Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.

Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a "female hormonal concoction" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  ("Not that there's anything wrong with that.")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was "grape seed oil extract."  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!

I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.

The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to "flavor" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!

I'll be back!

I've had the wonderful opportunity to visit Brooklyn Bowl not once, but twice in one week and let me tell you, I couldn't WAIT to write this review.  Instead of writing a review the first time, I waited for two visits, so I could write a really well balanced review. I thought the first time was too good to be true. Man, I'm glad I waited...

FINALLY, a REALLY great space on the strip.  As a local, I try to stay away from the strip as it's too congested and inconvenient for the everyday life.  This place, will absolutely bring me back time and time again.  When you approach "The BB," you'll notice a very aesthetically pleasing olden day-type cinema sign.  From the outside, it doesn't look that big, but don't let that fool you!  Once you enter, you'll make your way up the escalators.  To the right is a little bar, high top table seating area.  This area is full of large windows which offers great views of the Linq.  To the left of the concierge desk are the restrooms and a couple of ATM machines.  Pass the desk and there's either an outdoor space with table tops and a smoking section to the right, and a lovely restaurant with another bar!  Then, the good stuff:  Passed all that, is a HUGE concert venue area and 16 lanes of bowling.  WOW!  Don't worry, there's a few more bars to keep you liquored up all night long.  If that's not enough, make your way to top VIP area where there's lots of balcony space for the concert, sofas for seating and 16 more lanes to bowl on!  In the VIP area, there's also a bar, an outside roof deck and even a very eclectic living room which offers comfortable couches, big screen tvs, quirky signs and lights, all encompassed with a quieter atmosphere.  SOOO AWESOME!!!  

Brooklyn Bowl is full of amazing features. All around, there's leather couches, palm trees, artsy signs, vines covering the walls and lots of exposed brick. Shows lots of character. The staff is also on point!  They are nice, attentive and EVERYWHERE.  All I have to say is the staffing department did an amazing job!  (There's your shout out, Java!) In all seriousness, one of my former coworker left our company to work at this place and I'm glad she did.  I'm absolutely amazed!  On my first visit, our server was Michael, who goes by Micah.  He was AH-MAZE-ING.  So accommodating, so nice and personable, so awesome. I firmly believe the overall experience comes from the tone a server sets and The BB is filled with positive servers and bartenders.  

I'm not going to lie, the drinks aren't cheap.  I payed about $12 for my Ketel One vodka and soda water.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  You're on the strip.  If you're going to come here, make sure you can afford it.  If not, I think Southpoint has bowling and dollar drinks LOL.  I don't mind it at all, because I don't do this very often.  On both visits, I also had the awesome opportunity to try their food for free.  Here's what I had and here's what I thought:

BBQ pork sliders with cole slaw:  The pork was tender and flavorful.  The cole slaw added a crunchy texture and sweet taste.  The bun was good, maybe too thick, but didn't hurt the experience.

The San Gennaro Pizza:  VERY GOOD pizza.  It's filled with sausage, mozzarella and pepper.  This pizza is packed with sausage!  Lots of toppings offered NO complaints LOL. 

Chicken wings:  THE BEST THING THEY HAVE, BY FAR!  The batter was crispy and crunchy and light.  It was so flavorful with spices and not overpowering. It was served with honey which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It really just takes the wings to the next level.  So delicious.

Rolling Stone really hit home when they said Brooklyn Bowl is "one of the most incredible places on earth."  I really believe that on a Las Vegas strip perspective.  Who would have thought a venue that offers bowling and live music in one place would be such a hit!  This is exactly what Vegas needed.  Opening up with one of the coolest bands, The Roots, was a great move on their part.  Listen, if you're in the area, turn north on Koval and make a turn into Winnick street.  You need to park your car and walk to Brooklyn Bowl.  This place will blow you away.  Trust me, it's simply AH-MAZE-ING!

4.5 stars!

Today was my second visit, and I like this eatery!   The ambience is laid-back, despite the gorgeous marble bar counter, distinctive winery flourishes (I looked for beer taps,  but didn't see any), including cut-out kegs doubling as decorative shelves, and one flat-panel TV (this isn't a sports bar). Matt and Shawn (the latter had been the former manager of neighbor Four Peaks) are gracious as  always.  Chef Indy remembered me from my first visit, as the guest who ordered the spare ribs without the BBQ sauce and the chocolate bread pudding, which he made a chocolate ganache especially for me, because I couldn't have the regular chocolate sauce laced with corn syrup.

This afternoon's dishes all tasted terrific, and I enjoyed the textures:

Calamari app- Menu says $10, and 3.5 weeks ago was half-off during happy hour.  Menu still lists the price at $10, but my receipt said $9, with $2 off during HH.  Loved the crunch!  The calamari was prepared just the way I like calamari to be, and I know Mom would love it, as well.  The accompanying garlic aioli and marinara were great, as well, with the aioli being a little saltier than I'd prefer.  My only gripe is that for $9 original price, I didn't get a lot of calamari, so I'd only order it during HH...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w#Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w

Twisted Burger- $14, and comes with house fries.  Matt had told me about TR's mac 'n cheese more than three weeks ago and said that he could sub it for the fries, if I wanted.  The burger came with brie, perfectly-crisped thick bacon (!), arugula, and tomato jam, which I'd asked for on the side.  It's made with sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine and sugar reduction.  It added a definite sweetness to the burger and complemented it well, but for someone with inflammation issues, I'd skip it next time.  (Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, is one of many inflammatory foods.)  The mac 'n cheese was DELICIOUS!  Today's preparation consisted of cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and a little bacon.  I had to stop myself from eating too much!  Again, this dish is a little pricey for me, especially since I can't have the tomato jam...  The great quality of the mac 'n cheese kind of makes up for the price, just a little.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ#SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg#AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg

Double Chocolate Lava Cake- $8, and usually comes with vanilla ice cream, which contained corn syrup that I can't have, so  Chef Indy (sp?) offered to whip up some fresh heavy cream and granulated sugar.  He also offered to make a caramel sauce when I asked if instead of whipped cream, I could have some creme anglaise.  He wasn't sure which of the two I wanted, so he decided to give me both!  After the first bite of one lava cake, though, I knew the whipped cream and the caramel sauce were not needed.  This dessert should be called Better Than Sex, and really, what better metaphors for sex are there but volcanoes and lava, eh?  And boy, was this dark chocolate lava hot, thick, and decadent!  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  ;)  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the lava oozing out... I couldn't stop eating to take other photos...  If only there weren't other people present, I'd have licked that plate clean!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw#fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw

Btw, Thursday night is Ladies' Night, which means happy hour* deals ALL DAY for women.  Also, live music entertainment is held from 6p to 9p.  I enjoyed it, and so did the other women who filled up the main dining room.

*Happy hour deals changed since my last visit three and a half weeks ago.  It used to feature half-off appetizers, but now it's just $2 off the apps.  There are wine specials, too, both by the glass and bottles.  If you feel like splurging, try the Sexual Chocolate by Slo Down Vines, $45.  Very good!

GO BURGER OFF!!!

That seems like something Chef Ramsey would say! Unfortunately I will never know because Gordon was not here tonight. 

When I walked in, the bar was completely packed and about half the tables were full. I then saw there was a counter by the pass to eat at.  I asked to sit there and they said yes! Why wouldn't anyone want to eat there. You can see all of the food being made. The chef calling out orders. Yes there is some action but nothing like you would see on FOX! I did hear one F word by the sous chef but it was harmless. I needed more.  This is Vegas give me a show. 

I was trying to take it all in.  The waitress asked if I wanted a drink. I think she was hoping I would say, "Coors Light!" But I had to be difficult and ask her what kind of beers they had. She ran off to grab me a list. They had so many they were all listed on an iPad for me to scroll through. I did like looking at the photos of the specialty drinks. The pictures do make it easy to order.

I decided to order the Roasted jalapeo poppers to start with. They were stuffed with cheddar bacon and had a dipping sauce of cheddar ranch. One of the gimmicks was that only one jalapeno had a fiery surprise. Since I was eating all 6, I knew one was coming my way. It happened to be my 2nd jalapeo.  I like hot and it was really good. The sad part is that the others did not stand up, after that. The manager Scott happened to come by and see how I was doing.  I suggested that the restaurant have an option for all 6 to be fiery. He liked that idea. So hopefully he will tell it to Gordon but I'm not holding my breath. I'm sure Gordon has bigger things to worry about. 

We did have an issue but the waitress jumped on it with the sous chef. I told her I wanted to enjoy my poppers first and I wanted my burger after I was done with them. She told me not a problem that it would take 20 minutes.  A few minutes later she realized I was the only ticket on the board and she told the chef to push back my burger. The cook did not look happy.  I diverted my eyes, so I wouldn't get in trouble. So much for me wanting some action here. I was getting a little scared.  I'm so glad the waitress looked at the ticket board while we were talking. I would have been not happy. 

I decided to order the Hell's Kitchen Burger which had oven roasted tomatoes, roasted jalepeno, avacado & asadero cheese! I also ordered it medium rare.  I asked the waitress to have no extra salt added to my burger when it hit the grill. She told me that they would never do that. I had to disagree with her. She called over the sous chef who then informed the waitress they do hit the burger on the grill with salt, pepper and garlic. I am so glad I was sitting at the pass or my order might have been screwed up so bad. The waitress then asked the chef, "How do I even write that up?" He looked at her and said, "Check no seasoning on the ticket!"

I had to wait a lot longer for my burger then expected.  I almost thought that they forgot about me. I looked at the tickets and there were a bunch up there. So I was hoping I just got pushed back. It did give me a little time to do some social postings for BurGR. When I go out to eat it is starting to feel like a job, but I'm glad to share these amazing food experiences with others. 

The best part about sitting at the pass was that my burger was delivered by the sous chef. I also saw him wipe off a spot of blood from my white plate. Somewhere Gordon is smiling. It was also a good feeling to know that my burger did not linger up at the pass waiting for the waitress to pick it up. 

I must say that the burger was really good. Everything worked together.  I loved how the tomatoes and jalapenos were roasted. The fresh avacado was a nice touch. I also liked the asadero cheese which I had never had before. The bun was fantastic too. I also learned that they are baked on site. You can tell because how fresh they are. I also taste some butter in there. 

Chef Ramsey you put together one tasty burger. I'm so glad I don't live in Vegas because my fellow Yelpers know I don't need another burger joint to obsesses over plus I don't think they can handle all of the delicious photos. 

So when you come to Vegas, BurGR is a must visit. Thanks to the Aria and the Cosmopolitan because this area of the strip is the hot place to hang. BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood. Fastest way there is from the street. Do not go into the shops! Head into Casino door and it is right there by the front! Another tip is to have your Rewards Card with you too because you will save about a dollar per item. I saved $2...winning! Hey it's Vegas. I'm totally ahead now! Thanks Gordon!

The the foodie fest has changed since it first started. They have much more covered areas with seating and tables but I'm afraid that took up space that was once was occupied by many more food trucks at previous foodie fests here at the Silverton. The seating was desperately needed though so what can ya do?!  I ran into people at the event complaining about paying to get in. I don't have any complaint about paying however it should be cheaper. It seems odd to pay just to get in so you can pay for food but if it were free to get in then I'm sure everyone and their adopted cousin would show up and it would be even more packed and no fun!

We went the first day on Friday, and arrived around 6:00 pm. I was happy to have found a great parking spot right away. I was even happier when I saw there was nobody in line to get in! We had noticed a long line on the way in and thought we would have to wait in it. I asked the cashier at the gate if I was in the right line and she said that we could purchase tickets or show our online ticket so getting in was a snap! The tickets at the gate were $10 per person, $8 for senior citizens, children under 54" were free and that got you a wristband to get in into the foodie fest all 3 days for the one price. They had some trucks taking debit/credit cards but at the gate and most of the food trucks only took ca$h money. The 2nd day we went was Saturday and there was still no line at the gate but the lines inside were insane. I still had a few trucks I wanted to try the 2nd day but wasn't willing to wait 2 plus hours for them so just got something from the few lines that were short. I think it just depends what time and day you show up that determines your experience. They had a carnival off to the side of the foodie fest with rides and games carny food. 

It wasn't busy at first. Well, not including White Castle! They had such a long line. Thank goodness I am not a burger eater because the wait was at times up to 4 hours for White Castle however it did smell good around their tent. I wanted to make a couple rounds to see what I wanted to try.

Slow Cal BBQ:
It smelled too good outside this truck not to try something. There was only one person in front of me so I didn't wait long to order. After pondering the menu board I ordered the "Linker" combo priced at $9. This was a sandwich with hot links, pork and BBQ sauce. You get to choose your BBQ sauce and it is homemade. I chose "Dam Bro" and it was spicy and good! It came with a side so I chose "Red Beans & Rice" and it was full of yummy flavor! I was stoked to find out that they are not just in Cali anymore but also here in Vegas! I will for sure eat from this truck again! During the 2nd day of our visit I stopped by this truck to try their "Cajun Potato Salad" and it was so good!

Torpedo Potato:
After seeing pictures I knew I wanted to try this place! I am also glad I tried it when I did because I had maybe 6 people in front of me but later in the night and the following day that I passed by it was very, very long! I ordered the "Original Tornado" and had them add sour cream & onion and nacho cheese. It cost $7.50 and I loved it! I wish we had one of their trucks here in Vegas!!!!!

Roamin' Dough:
We met up with some friends who wanted to stop at this truck. My friend ordered the "Bacon Wrapped Dates"priced at $5 and they were so darn good! When we came back to the foodie fest the 2nd day I stopped and ordered some and they were just as good as the day before. 

Fluff Ice:
I was checking out another truck and when I came back around the corner I found my hubby in line for this truck. I also found fellow yelper Nelson Q in line behind hubby! It was nice to catch up with Nelson but what was great was the history lesson he gave us about boba! I had no idea what it was or what it tasted like. I wanted to try the "Strawberry Fluff" with blue honey boba. It cost $7 and was huge! It is hard to describe the fluff ice but it is shaved ice with condensed milk and I'm sure something else I just know it was yummy! The boba tasted chewy and kinda like a gummy bear. It was neat to try the boba but I can't say I am a fan. 

Wa Da Pho:
While in line one of the owners told it this was there launching day! They had fancy TVs and ipad looking menus. My friend ordered "Da Pho-licious Q" for us to share. I had high hopes for this truck since it is local and just starting out. The sandwich wasn't that great. I really enjoyed the bread a lot but the meat was so thick that when you went to bite into it the meat all comes out and you are left with just bread. I would try something else from this truck but not this sandwich again.

Deep Fried Vendor:
I didn't see a name for this place it wasn't a truck but a vendor in a booth. They had all sorts of deep fried goodies. I wanted to try the "Deep Fried Reese's Big Cup". It cost $5. I felt the price was too steep but I ate every bite and loved it!

I will be back!

===================
I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if the succulent wrappers used to encase the dumpling fillings are hand made and the dumplings are assemble and cook to order. It is a major comfort food category for me. In fact  boiled dumplings is the first item I have ever personally ordered on my own with lunch money my mom gave me for elementary school in Taipei. It was just a few pennies each and the shop made it and delivered it in a plastic bag to my school with my name on it just in time for lunch break.  I don't remember much about how it tasted, but the memory of having tremendous emotional satisfaction and joy from that simple meal is still very strong.

So while driving to try out a new ramen place a few miles down the street, the light from this new restaurant caught my eye, and I decided to make a quick,but very safe u-turn into the small parking lot in front of Dumpling King.  There are plenty of spaces in the back of the building, in case this restaurant gets super popular in the coming weeks. I was initially afraid that I was dropping in as the restaurant was about to close, since it was fairly empty inside, but looking at their hours of operation, I was relieved to see that I had 1.25 hours left.

I made a quick scan of the restaurant, and pretty much was blinded by all the red color in the restaurant.  Red floral printed seat covers over each chair.  The tablecloth were reddish in color, and the lighting was fairly dim, so yeah I was slightly disoriented from the color red.  I wonder if that is a normal reaction or it is just one of those minor details that made me just a little different from the other 6 odd billion people on this planet (not including the aliens that left zigzag lights over the skies of Hawaii).

Anyway, after picking a nearby table with good lighting for taking food pictures and going over the menu, I eventually found the "dumpling" section all the way on the last page under "Main Food" and ordered the following:

101. Beef Steamed Dumplings(4)  - Decent flavor, but I felt the texture of the filling was off. Like it was overground or overworked.

102. Beef Dumplings(4)  - Same filling as the above, except this dumpling is boiled.

103. Lamb Dumplings(4)  - Good dumpling, nice lamb flavor. Dumpling is also boiled and looks exactly like the Beef Dumpling.

112. Stone Dumplings  - This is like a big plate full of pot stickers that is cooked in a pan, and inverted onto the plate. The residual starchy water forms a thin crust that connects all of the dumplings together (see the picture).  It is kind of cool looking, but eat these fast.  Because I was taking time to take pictures, and all the food came more or less at the same time, I noticed that a small pool of oil puddle up on the plate after like 10 minutes, which made it taste not as good as the very first piece I had.  Just something to think about if you are dining solo or eat very slowly.

NOTE: Although their menu have prices listed for dumplings with portions of (4), I was told that it was a misprint and now the minimum order is (8) dumplings, so you now need to order those items x2.  But for the Beef and Lamb Dumplings that comes out to (8 pieces) for $5, not too bad price wise, but does present an additional hurdle against trying as much of the menu as possible without asking for the doggie bag.  They did however let me order four pieces of each of the Beef Dumplings and Lamb Dumplings, for a total of eight pieces, since both are cooked the same way.

Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.

Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.  

3.5 stars.  I am sure another update will be forth coming should I get to try the XLB on my next visit.

===================
Let me apologize for not writing during these past few days...  sori!
Here is the reason...  I knew I was going to Vegas, I understand that my next one is my 100th review, therefore, I had to review one of the much better places to make my 100th review shine!  There's no other place better than City of Sin to scout out all the awesome eateries so that is why I've delayed my review for the entire weekend.. again, sori!  I do hope you all understand...

So... 100th one... what should I have...  Buffet of course!  Didn't get the chance to check out Wynn again (it's been a long time), but at least I end up at Rio's famous Carnival World Buffet...  So here it goes...

First of all, the name of the buffet has the word "World" in it... I bet you wouldn't expect it but literally, the selection is as big as this world!  Last time I've been there I remember the food lineup were as long as Walmart on Black Friday!!!  But now... it seems like the line is actually as long as Best Buy on Black Friday!!! (For those who has done the BF thing will understand my reference, good luck by the way if you are going this year!)

Focus Henry Focus!!!  Ok... so... damn!!!  The selection seem to be longer than before... so let me tell you how this great wall of buffet is set up!  

Starting from the left, you got like 8 different styles of pizzas, some condiments for burgers, bunch of seafood delicacies, crab legs & crab claws, deep fried seafood, mash potatoes along with the carving station, roast chicken, Mexican food sections such as taquitos, flautas, quesadilla, mole, carne asada, more mexican condiments, etc., The Bar (for some real fun drinks not ice tea or coke), Fresh Noodle station with pho, egg noodles, soups ranging from egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, etc. fish balls, pork balls, beef balls, more chinese condiments, chinese food such as chow mein, stir fried veggies, some meat dishes, dim sum, sweet bbq pork, roast duck, Italian/seafood, lasagna, meat balls, blackened catfish, broiled salmon, salisbury steak, country fried steak, , corn, pork chops,4 types of hot soups, salad station, fruits, cold salad related sides, wall........  Whew.... I'm terribly sorry for the EXTREMELY LONG RUN ON SENTENCE, but that is the best way to describe this unworldly buffet line!!! It is literally that long!!!  And let me tell you, despite all the descriptions, I probably missed like 30% of the food on that great wall of buffet!!!  It's absolutely ridiculous that they expect anyone to try all of their food here!!!

Ah ha!  That's when I come in!  Agent H on the job!

So I had to get very small portions and was actually able to get one of each samples from the plates on display... OMG was I full!!!  I swear I will never do that again!!!  Rio I hate you for doing this to me!!!  You leave all this deliciousness out there just so you can see me suffer!!! WHY???  (But I thank you for the yummy food!)

So enough with the descriptions.. I know if I continue on this post 5001 character is not enough!  So here's my assessment and evaluation of this monstrosity that they called a buffet line.  

Everything was actually decently made!!!  I pretty much enjoyed every single thing there with the exception to the following...  (you definitely should read this and skip them because I suffered to get you this piece of important info!)

Things to skip:
**Sushi -- hard cold rice, not fresh at all
**Veggies -- waste of stomach space
**Noodle soup -- This is an iffy... I loved the soup but was way too salty, maybe Mr. chef there can add some hot water or something? It's quite salty
**Salmon -- Not sure how but they overcooked it... pretty dry and hard
**Corn Chowder -- nothing special, again takes up space in tummy
**Dim sum -- maybe it wasn't fresh when we got there but looked stale and old... very uninteresting.......
**Fried fish filet -- Dude, these patties are from the supermarket!  (Van De Kamps)  Not tasty at all

Do try everything else!

Now... they still have dessert!!!  AHHHHH!! I can't take this anymore!  All this food and now a dessert island station right by the exit!!! 

Sure I'll take some yummy treats please!

Gelatos! Gelatos! Gelatos!  Tried all of them and here are my favorite and least liked choices...

Dislike:  Coconut---way too sweet
Right in the middle:  Vanilla Yogurt---pretty tasty without that much sugar
Favorite:  Sugarless Chocolate---WOWzers!  Taste like chocolate without the sugar!  Rich, Creamy, and absolutely amazing for being sugarless!  Where you've been all this time???

Other desserts were on my notable list too such as bread pudding (I heart bread puddings with Whiskey sauce), cheesecake cup, and the best dessert would have to be the super eggy flan!  Extremely enjoyable!

So now... can someone wheel me out of this place?  Get me out of here before I say... Yes... I would like to see what else they got... maybe another ice cream?  maybe another cake?  Maybe this is one of Sin City's absolute best?  Just maybe...

===================
After a couple of buffets, our plans of a "nice" dinner were slowly dwindling away, so in the late afternoon/early evening on our last night in town, while the rest of the guys were breaking in my friends PS3 that they just gave him, I hopped on my friend's computer and checked out places that we could possibly go. A dinner at a high end fancy restaurant would have had slim chances since it would have been such last minute, plus I was getting the feeling the guys wanted a chill dinner. Trying to compromise, I hit the "$" and "$$" signs in my search.

One of the things that popped up was this place.  Personally for me, I absolutely love burgers, so I know I would have loved it.  And while it's no Fleur De Lys, I thought "how can you go wrong with a restaurant by Hubert Keller?"

I skimmed a couple of reviews and made the suggestion to the guys.  They all seemed to like the idea. The listing said they take reservations, however I believe the listing is wrong on that because when I called, the hostess said they did not take reservations, but would happily put our name down when we were going to head in.  It was still a little early, so I called back about 30 minutes later to put my name in, however we took a little long getting over to Mandalay Bay from the Wynn, and they had apparently already called my name.

Not to worry, she bumped us back up, gave me a buzzer, and said it would still be about 20 minutes since we did have a party of 11.

We finally sat down and overall, the dcor and ambience of this places feels like Daily Grill meets a sports bar.  The booths on the right were had dark wood high backs, yet while the dark wood bar still resembled something out of a Western movie saloon, they had several televisions all along the back wall.  It was fully stocked as well.  They took a page from Barney's Beanery and each booth had it's own television.  Down the middle were a series of tables and our table was set up near the back, closet to the kitchen.

Our server Renee, was really cool and cute too.  She looked a little bit like a cheerleader right out of high school, with her hair in pigtails and her bright yet borderline smile, she was actually really nice and took good care of us.  And no, I don't mean in "that" way.  Pervs....

The menu is simple: burgers and burgers.  On the left, they had some preset burgers, which I'm sure were meticulously decided upon by Chef Keller.  There was one burger called the "Rossini Burger" and it was a burger consisting of American Kobe beef, seared foie gras, and black truffles.  While it sounded AWESOME, I was not ready to fork up $60 for a burger.  I was almost going to suggest we get that as a table and split the cost.  But to no avail.

The other side of the menu consists of building your own burger.  The concept is not new with places like The Counter, 5 Guys Burgers and Fries, and a few other places, but Hubert Keller included the typical add ons such as avocado, caramelized onions, aioli, and various cheeses, but he brings in a variety of gourmet items such as foie gras ($12), black truffles ($30 for 1/3 oz), Portobello mushrooms, and sauces such as a red wine and shallot reduction.

You start with your meat.  You have a choice of chuck, angus, American Kobe, buffalo and turkey.  The basic burger will run about $9-11 or $17 for the Kobe and is topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle wedge.  Then there are the add-ons.  Everything were of various prices, but quite reasonable and expected.  Cheeses were $.70, condiments ranged from $1 to $1.50, an avocado was about $2.50?  In all, you had a choice of I would say at least 2 dozen items.  Of course the gourmet items (as listed above) were more expensive.

I got the angus with both Monterey jack and provolone cheese, caramelized onions, aioli (should've gotten the chipotle aioli) and proscuitto.  You have a choice of plain, sesame, wheat, or ciabatta (I think there was one more?) as your bun.  I decided to just play it safe and go with a plain bun.

Most of the reviews I had read and raved about the sweet potato fries, and for $2.85, you can order an individual portion as your side.

Our food came out and the burger looked and smelled delicious.

I couldn't really tell between my 2 cheeses, but oh well.  The meat was well seasoned and while it wasn't a perfect combination of flavors, I really liked all of my toppings.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy but not overcooked, so I really liked that.

Overall, I think everybody liked it.  I've heard small things here and there that they didn't like, but I consider it a successful meal.  They apparently also have build your own milkshakes, but I think that would have absolutely sent me over the top.

I definitely know where I'm coming to get a good burger next time I'm in Vegas.

===================
Awful!  First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.  

I went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.  

A woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, "I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.  

At this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.  

There are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?  Needless to say, the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.  Oh, and the people that go here: I might as well stay up in North Scottsdale, it's the same yuppie, "I'm so important"/30K millionaire crowd that has taken over what used to be the great city of Scottsdale.  It's sad, I really wanted to like this place and it has the potential to be fabulous...if they just start over.

Don't waste your time or your money.

So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!

COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)

So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!

So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...

Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)

The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!

Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)

The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...

Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)

Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!

Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!

One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...

So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!

Wickedly Awesome!

LOSING!!!

This is not my favorite hotel on the strip. Is it full of history with old rooms that smell? Yes that is the smell of History. Come on Sinatra has a suite here. I am sure there are things in this hotel we do not want to know anything about, so sometimes it is better to just hold your nose & deal with it.

I have only stayed at this hotel because of work. I would never personally pick this place ever.

When I check-in, I asked for a Humidifier and I was promptly told, "the Riv does not have any". I informed the check-in agent that I stay in Vegas 3 times a year & every hotel has humidifiers. She promptly told me I was wrong & she questioned what hotels I stayed at last. I informed her and she said, "That is hard to believe because one of the hotels I mentioned was a sister property and they do not have humidifiers!" I looked at her and said, "I am sorry because they gave me one for a week!"  So frustrating! Why are you arguing with me?

Two days went by and I was about to go to Walgreens to purchase a Humidifier. I decided to call Housekeeping and just ask. The Manager in Housekeeping said, "I wish you would have called two days ago because I think I am out of them!" I was so mad that I actually listened to the front desk. I should have just called two days ago. The Manager was so sweet because I asked her to call me back within the hour because if I did not hear from her I would go and buy one. Five minutes later there was a knock at my door and I was handed a humidifier.  That was 5 star service but the front desk not knowing or even making an attempt to get me a humidifier was 0 stars.

My dry cleaning was suppose to be in my room by 7pm the night before. As I was getting ready in the morning I noticed my dry cleaning was not there. I tried several times to call the Bell Hop, to inquiry about my dress shirt but no one ever picked up the phone. So I decided to pick up my shirt myself & went down on my way to work. I informed the Bell Hop my shirt was never delivered. He then looked at me and said, "Did you look in the closet?" I honestly wanted to biff myself in the head and say, "I wish I had a V8!" I looked at him and said, "Really?" He then went to look for my shirt but made sure to tell me that he probably did not have it. Guess what? He had my shirt. Then he had the rudeness to say, "I am going to need to see your ID!" I looked at him and said, "What are the chances that I gave you my last name, my room number, color of shirt and that it wasn't delivered to my room and it isn't my dress shirt???" He said, "Well I have to be sure!" I said, "Just be sure you are making me late for work and I now have to get dressed in the Lobby bathroom now!" Honestly what is the deal with these guys! Are people stealing dry cleaning in hotels?

I also had to leave notes around my room to inform the maid not to touch my stuff. Please do not move my toothbrush and various bathroom stuff. Is it really necessary?  The kicker was the day I walked in and my room was not made and it was 7pm at night. I called the manager and he said, "I see your room has been marked off as cleaned!" I told him to come on up or I could email him photos. He asked if he could send up the maid now and I said, "No! I am in my room & I am good!" Five minutes later there was a knock on my door from the maid who insisted to come in and clean my room. I had to tell her that I was good & did not want my room cleaned. It was more principal. Don't check my room off as clean and then not clean it.

The kicker is this. I decided to go green & check-out from my television. It then asked me to find the keyboard in the room to type in my email to send me out a final bill. I then opened every drawer in my room to find the keyboard. I then called down to the front desk and was informed that none of the rooms have keyboards. Really? Why tell me to check out from the room & I can not get a bill emailed to me. The front desk manger promised me to email me my final bill. It has been 7 days since I have checked out I have not gotten my final bill. I called after 24 hours and had them email me again. No email. I have in fact called 5 times & I have them send out emails to two different email addresses. Guess what? No email. 

I also had food here once too. I had one of the pre-packed salads from the coffee shop. I opened my salad only to find wilting lettuce in the container. So gross! That was the first & last time that I ate at the hotel. If you stay here you are going to be taking cabs down the street or walking to get to any decent restaurants. There is nothing to do at this end of the strip!

I am hating this review right now because I am taking a big deep breath & reliving this lack of customer service at the Riv! This hotel is not a Five Star Hotel. My room was suppose to be non-smoking but it still smelled like smoke. I guess after 58 years you will never be able to get the smoke of the walls!

This ranks high on one of the most amazing and unusual culinary adventures that I've ever had.

A friend tipped me off that this chicken place was opening this week.  I so wanted to go, but I had another gig, and figured that I'd miss out.  As it so happened, said gig ended just early enough for me to go right before closing, so the missus and I hightailed it to ensure that we got there before closing.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured "Why not", and bit into it.

o_O

It was amazing.  Super sweet, like cake.  I ate two pieces while the line trudged on.

As we got closer to the door, another staff member came out and started handing out copies of Flav's autobiography.  And now I had something to read while waiting.  People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  "If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken", he said, "you can come up and punch me in the face."

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

....

o_O

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a "bucket list" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.

I never thought I would be writing a review for a grocery store, but I also never left one asking my wife if I could come back with her next week when she does the weekly shopping.  I also never went to work the next day and pondered if I should drop by a "grocery store" on the way home for a beer.  This is the effect 201 Central has on you. 

They are promoting themselves as a "specialty store", but I would describe them as a super market nesting doll made up of a sandwich shop, shoved into a coffee bistro, shoved into a local bar, shoved into a wine room, shoved into a grocery store, shoved into a Total Wine, with a JR's Cigar humidor room off to the side. This place is the unofficial house party headquarters, which happens to live in the same shopping plaza as the ABC store. They might as well change the name to Fridays, because this is the first place you will stop after punching your last weekly time card.

When you walk in the first thing you see is a small bar off to the right. There are stools lined up all around it, and a WiFi seating area with tables as well.  This is where you can pick up sandwiches, snacks, coffee, tea, soft drinks, or what drew me over, their beer and wine selections.  I was looking over the craft beer menu, when the guy behind the bar asked me what I was interested in. I said I was just browsing the menu and planned on walking around, that maybe we would stop in on the way out. To which he replied, you know I can pour you a pint of beer and you can walk around the store drinking it while you shop, to which I replied, Uhhhhhh then by all means I'll take a Left Hand Milk Stout and my wife will have a Blue Moon. And there we went, pushing our metal shopping cart, drinking two pints of beer, they had my return service right there. Awesome concept Harris Teeter!

As we pushed through the store drinking, commenting, and gasping at the amount of local craft beer and wine selections they had, we came across a total of 4 craft beer sample stations. I had offerings from Great Lakes Brewing, the best being their Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, fell in love at the Sweet Water brewing station when the rep realized I had tried all their Sweet Water offerings before, she opened the beer freezer and pulled out Danktoberfest and let me sample it right there in the store. Needless to say that tactic worked I left with two bombers. The Saranac vendor was also there giving out tastings of their entire winter sampler pack. Absolutely loved the Chocolate Lager and they were also selling this limited 32oz growler of their delicious Pumpkin Ale for get this, $3.49, but wait I forgot 201central this week has 20% off ALL craft beer in the store so that was really $2.79!  I filled my cart like I was at Sam's Club buying toilet paper, and we took our slight buzz to the next tasting station which was none other than Bell's Brewery. I love all of their beers, so we sampled their entire catalog, and even though their beers are more expensive, you get what you pay for, and luckily the 20% deal came through again! What a great start to this franchise!

I will wrap this up, but just know we also stopped by a wine tasting station, walked into a giant humidor room with the sweet aroma of cigars, and noticed they sell every chip, dip, dessert, and microwavable snack item you would ever want to stock your house with to entertain family or friends.  The Grand Opening is this week at both their locations so walk in, grab a drink, and evaluate it yourself.  I think they have struck gold with this idea, and I hope it catches fire and spreads to every upscale super market in the area.  I'm a huge fan of where Harris Teeter has went with this concept, and I'll probably start stealing the grocery list off the refrigerator just to have a reason to shop here again.

This review is just for the sushi part of the restaurant because we didn't try the Teppan side but we will be back for sure to give it a shot. From the little I saw it looked like they put on a good show.
Thanks to Living Social for this find. I love Japanese food and sushi so when I was looking around for what I call "Prepaid Date Nights" I saw this place and bought the deal. I didn't even know this place was here.
It was Saturday night so time to break out one of these "Prepaid Date Nights" out and give it a try. Just another unassuming place in a strip mall. When you open what looks like a big wooden door the inside is very nice. Teppan tables on one side and regular tables on the other with a sushi bar along the wall next to that. The hostess came up, had our reservation and we were seated immediately. The Teppan tables looked full but there were plenty of regular tables available. Some of the parties at the Teppan tables looked like they don't get let out much. They were having a little too good of a time. Drinky drinky. But it was all a good time. Our waitress Colleen came over right away and was very very nice. She explained the menu, the happy hour specials, I still haven't figured out exactly when happy hour is at this place but whenever it was it was going on now so let's do it, and she offer suggestions. All of the wait staff had these LED name tags with their names scrolling or dropping or going by in different ways. My girlfriend and I both thought they were really cool. I can never pick sushi rolls because everything sounds so good. I would order way to much food. So my girlfriend is in-charge of ordering sushi whenever we go out. She hasn't picked bad yet. I did make the suggestion that I wanted to try some spicy rolls like the Arizona roll. So we ordered the I Sushi roll, the Arizona roll, the Vegas roll and the baked I Sushi roll. We had never heard of a baked roll so we were curious plus if they are putting their name on it it must be a specialty.
We ordered drinks. She got some green cocktail thing with pineapple, which she really liked and turned out according to Colleen to be one of the more popular drinks, I thought is tasted good too and I don't really like pineapple. I got a Kirin Ichiban. Bonus points for having this. How can you be a Japanese place and not have Kirin. We also got two ice waters. Here is another thing this place does that I really like, they put a slice of cucumber instead of a slice of lemon in the waters. I do not like lemon in my water. If I wanted lemon aid I would have ordered it and I wouldn't have because I don't like it. But cucumber was so much better. Extra points for this original thought. At least the first time I have seen it.
The rolls came out pretty quick. Now it was not that busy but even then some places take quite awhile to roll. But these came out bam, bam, bam. Wow were they good. So fresh. I mean the fish was swimming around happily this morning fresh. Like we lived in a coastal city fresh. The I Sushi roll had jalapenos and chipotle sauce on it but it was a good hot not a burn your face off hot. The Arizona roll had jalapenos on it too but didn't seem as hot as the other. Of course it's heat might have been swimming upstream from the I Sushi rolls heat. The Vegas roll was very good too but I think my favorite of the night was the baked I Sushi roll. They were all very good but this one was just that much better. They had a lobster and crab ball on top of a small roll on it's side then they baked the whole thing. It was so warm and good. Even though I was full I could have eaten more of that one.
We both really enjoyed the food and the service. We will definitely be back here with or without a coupon of some kind. The prices where very reasonable. Especially with the level of freshness of the fish. Next time we will try the Teppan for sure but probably still order a roll or two of this great sushi. This just became my new favorite place for sushi. So much better than the place down the street. I don't care if that place is all you can eat I would much rather come here. I will take fresh, great sushi and exceptional service over all you can eat any day. Keep up the great work I Sushi & Teppan.

Welcome to another "Hype of Charlotte!" Here is the "chronicle" of the night:

It's my good friend's birthday coming up and he wanted to get dinner here. I went online, made a reservation for 8:15pm last night. I also browsed their menu online, thus I know this is a pretty pricey joint. The funny thing to me is that their seafood entrees are better priced than their meat entrees ($20s vs $30-40s). I don't have problem with the price for as long as the food and service are up to par.

I guess the night was doomed before it even began. I called ahead trying to make sure I know where to park. No answer. Well, I know my way around uptown fairly well, so I figured it should be pretty easy to spot the parking garage. So this forever-been-abandoned-building-formerly-known-as-The-Park does NOT have a public garage that I could see. I drove around that block of Caldwell @ 3rd/4th Street 2.5 times and it's simply baffling how to get in there. I ended up parking on the street at the meter (which is free after 6pm during the week). AND the main entrance to the building faces in away from the main street (Caldwell) next to a gravel parking lot. It's the most bizarre setup just to get into the place.

Once I walked through the sliding door to the building (which is also partly a hotel), I saw 2 valets sitting on their behinds. Well, I guess that may have explained the parking fiasco... they probably should have been outside by the door so at least we had a valet option. It wasn't even cold. Then we got "ordered" to use the elevator on the right by the door lady because the elevators weren't clearly marked.

22 floors upward later, we walked into Fahrenheit. Looking into the bar area, I could see the appeal. There were big windows/doors opened up to the balcony area, the breeze was coming in to the bar. The lights of the beautiful city skyline in front of it. BUT it's nothing a nice hotel in a bigger city where it's typical to have a roof top bar couldn't offer. So this is the 1st establishment in Charlotte that offers it... it just details how behind Charlotte can be (as much as I love my adopted hometown).

Hostess apparently was in crisis mode with another patron who placed a to-go order. From the sound of it, this lady placed an order over an hour ago, and the food still wasn't ready. She must be staying at the hotel, because she said she was tired and she just wanted food and if it's not already cooked, she's fine not eating at this point. YIKE! Not a good sign... shouldn't a situation like this be handled professionally AWAY from the front door by a manager???? 

We got seated promptly, to the left of the entrance, in a side dining area. We walked by several big tables (6+ top). We ended up at a  2-top table in between two big parties. I felt very squeezed in. And by gosh, there was no air circulation. For those who know me personally, you know I am NOT a high maintenance person. But no one should feel uncomfortable in any restauarant, let alone a high end establishment. And NO ONE greeted us. There was no water. Nothing, nada.

By now my friend and I just looked at each other and contemplating leaving. The waiter who was busy handling one of the big tables next to us finally turned to us and acknowledged the fact that we were there. At this point we decided to move ourselves to the bar area. I stopped by the hostess station to inform her of our move. She smiled and said that's ok. 

Well, call me crazy, but shouldn't that be a hint that something went wrong? In that case, shouldn't a manager be informed that guests just moved themselves to the bar for unknown reasons? And thus shouldn't a manager stop by to at least inquire and pretend it mattered?? Instead we got a visit from a waitress. She asked if we didn't get any service, which we said yes. She then said she was afraid that was the case because she saw us and she was about to come over to take care of us. I don't know if it was a case of concern, or a case of table section turf war.

The bartender was... present. That's the best description I could muster. He was there, but he wasn't friendly or attentive. He got us our drinks, took our food order and efficient. 

Food... finally we got to the food. At this point we didn't know if ordering food was a good idea. We talked about going to another place for dinner. But we ended up order the lobster sandwiches ($13) and spring rolls ($9). Food arrived in RECORD TIME. I meant, we ordered, food came. It felt more like the food was already done and we just happened to order it. Food was ok at best. There were 2-3 small pieces of lobster meat on each of the 3 sliders. The minced chicken in the spring rolls were a little dry. 

4 drinks (3 Jim Beam & Coke = $28.50 and 1 Chenin Blanc $8) and 2 small plates set me back $73. It was the worst $73 I spent. 

Words of advise: just because it's new, has pretty view, has a chef's name attached to it does NOT make it a great restaurant automatically.They have much works to do.

===================
I have been visiting Vegas regularly now since about 1986, back when I couldn't even get to stand in the casinos, never mind play.
I've stayed at many, many places, ranging from Circus Circus as a child, all the way to the penthouse at Caesar's Palace or a massive suite at the now-gone Sheraton (yes, those last two were superb).

I cannot say Venetian has the very best room ever, since that penthouse thing was quite amazing, but for the purposes of this review, I will stick to the basic room that each hotel is offering.  When staying within that range, there is NOTHING that compares to the Venetian Hotel.
NOTHING, I assure you.

From the minute you pull into the front of this hotel, you will FEEL the difference as your valet opens your door singing some Italan opera tune at the top of his lungs, or as your valet in his red/white striped shirt takes your bags.  You enter the lobby and just stop for a second to take it all in.  Interior is amazing from the minute you walk in with ceiling as high as the sky - paintings/murals that make you gasp, and floors that sparkle and really make you feel "You're in Vegas, baby."  

All of their rooms are "suites" and are about 700+ sq ft in size.  You won't find anything of this size avaialble at other hotels without requiring twice the money you're paying here.  Is it expensive?  Uh... yeah, if you don't gamble heavily, and you need to pay for your room, it will range about $350+ per night, if not up to $399 per night when busy, but if you are anything like me and really enjoy a good hotel experience, it's worth every cent.  The way to do the Venetian best, though, is to gamble here, and have your own casino host to comp your room/meals, etc.  Granted, going this route can end up costing a helluva lot MORE than $350 so you might consider just paying for it if gambling is not one of your talents.  The casino hosts here really take care of you during your stay, and make sure every need of yours is met.  It's sort of like the service of being on a good cruise - - in the middle of the freakin' desert.

Gambling.
The casino is enormous.  Prepare to get lost your first 70 times or so.  I still have trouble finding the elevators at 6 AM after gambling and partying and I've been here more than most people I know.  Venetian's comp policy is a bit higher than other casino's at $70/bet for a minimum of four hours per day.  If you can afford that, though -  gamble here.  Great dealers, super funny pit bosses who know you by name and always greet you and something to entertain everyone.  Good ventilation - smoke is never a problem.

The Venetian does not have a buffet, as of yet anyhow.  So if you're in Vegas for cheap food that you can eat to the point of gluttony - - this may not be the place for you.  In fact, I'm told they deliberately left out a buffet to keep people like you out.  :-)  Their idea, not mine.  In any case, what they do have available are some of the finest dining establishments ever - and ample choices of cuisines.  They have plenty of restaurants on their main level, but many more also on their shopping terraza on the second floor.  Superb Dining.  Excellent Dim Sum.  Zeffirino's - amazing.

24 hour room service is available but it's costly.  I am in constant argument with the room service staff about the meek coffee they deliver.  Now I am not one to mind paying $15 for a pot of coffee, but give me something I won't call "black water".  I mean, I ordered it to wake up - not fall back asleep.  I realize they want me downstairs wasting money instead of hanging out in my room drinking coffee, but geez - I have to wake up to do it - and the quicker I am conscious, the faster I will get down there to blow my money, no?

That is perhaps my only complaint about the Venetian.  
Otherwise, the rooms are fabulous, huge, and the bathrooms are about as big as any hotel room you'd find in NYC, all marble, a shower that will wash your worries away, and a jacuzzi tub that makes you forget you just lost $____________ downstairs.  Who cares when you feel this good, eh?

For a true-to-style Vegas experience, I would definitely recommend checking into the Venetian.  While not the most economical way to go - it truly adds to your Vegas trip in every way.  Location is also perfectly centralized, with easy access to anything you might want to see.  I hate walking in the Vegas heat, so I usually cab it to anything, including a ride across the street to the Mirage Hotel.  While cabbies will look at you strange when you ask to be driven across the street - - you offer a good sum of money and they'll slam on the gas and get you there WAY before your friends arrive there 20 minutes later, dripping in sweat.  The extra you just paid the cabby is simply money you didn't lose at the tables instead.  

This is, afterall, LAS VEGAS!
I'll be there this Easter Weekend!

It's not often that a new hotel and casino opens up in Las Vegas, especially one that's transplanting some of LA's most well-known restaurants. With the food and all the hype surrounding the SLS, I've been pretty excited for the place to open! So much so, that we decided to book a room and stay here on opening night. For a 325 square foot room with a single king bed in the "Story Tower", our rate was $209 per night and we stayed just 1 night.

When we first arrived at about 6pm, we made our way to the parking garage that you enter from Paradise. And although we were trying to check in, we weren't allowed to valet or pull up to the front for unloading, as were told they were just too full and busy. After finally finding a spot in the garage, we were faced with broken elevators and had to carry our bags down 5 flights of stairs. Thankfully we just had 1 bag with enough for 1 night, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was frustrating and not the best first impression. When we got to check-in, they were well aware of the elevator issues and offered us a couple free drinks at the Monkey Bar, which is just across the way. The check-in by the way, was pretty straight forward, quick and painless.

For the rooms, they offer several different types and there's 3 towers...the World Tower, the Lux Tower and the Story Tower, which is where we stayed. The room itself was a bit on the small side, but it was quite impressive. When you walk in, your attention is immediately drawn to the opaque white bed and couch that have dimmable lights build right into them! There's also a 55" TV hanging from the wall and a giant mirror on the ceiling above the bed that might catch your attention. The styling is very modern with a darker grey paint, and yellow accents underneath a strange industrial concrete style ceiling. Both the bathroom and shower, which are separated, also feature bright yellow tiles, and are hidden behind two large sliding mirrors. For the size of the room, I was pretty impressed with the layout and use of space. And although expensive, the mini bar was nicely stocked. We did have issues with some lights and the TV not working in the room, but that easy to look past. Overall though, I can't say I'd recommend paying $200 a night here...actually about $260 after all taxes, fees, etc.

When it comes to the casino itself, their main focal point seems to be restaurants and nightlife. In my opinion, these are super solid restaurant choices and worth the visit alone. However, if you aren't a partier, you might find yourself bored here. Compared to other casinos, the machines and tables seem to be limited and they are all very close together. There's also minimal shopping choices and apart from a coffee shop, I was surprised to see that they didn't include any type of dedicated dessert/treat spot here. For the most part though, I thought the overall style of the place was alright. But some things were strange and seemed out of place, like the open industrial ceiling, and the buffet which is upstairs and completely separate from just about everything. By the way, the Sunday breakfast/lunch buffet was $31, and the dinner $37...ouch!

My feelings on the employees are very mixed. As many people have mentioned, the amount of employees standing around and doing nothing but talking was a bit ridiculous. I can understaff overstaffing for grand opening, but on several occasions we saw 3+ employees in a group just kind of standing around and chatting. We also had our fair share of issues during our stay, and our interaction with the staff was a bit hit and miss. Since this was the first day, I won't get too far into all our issues but we had to visit the desk 3 times and speak with 3 different managers due to room problems and huge bill discrepancies. On Saturday night, we spent an hour dealing with a $140 charge for two drinks at the Monkey bar. Then on Sunday, it took us over an hour just to check out because our bill was beyond messed up, to the tune of over $200. However, Aubrey who checked us out was extremely nice, patient and seemed genuinely apologetic about the mess we had on our hands. She was the reason I decided to bump this review up to 3 stars, instead of 2. 

With SBE behind the place, I really thought they would have a lot smoother launch. I mean, you obviously can't expect a flawless experience on opening weekend, but I was a bit surprised to see just how many issues they had. I was also disappointed with some of the pricing they have set up. Bottled beers at the center bar are $8 each and a Gatorade at The Perq coffee shop was $5! Yes, it's a casino but c'mon. And why are there no locals specials for anything?

All in all, we had a great time and the restaurants will surely keep me a regular at SLS. However, it was a bit overhyped and unless they bring out some killer room rates, this wouldn't be my choice for another staycation.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.
